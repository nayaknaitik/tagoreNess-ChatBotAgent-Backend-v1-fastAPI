Age 16--see tagore.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo W. B. Yeats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks are due to the editor of _Poetry, a Magazine of Verse_, for\r\npermission to reprint eight poems in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the lyrics of love and life, the translations of which from\r\nBengali are published in this book, were written much earlier than the\r\nseries of religious poems contained in the book named _Gitanjali_. The\r\ntranslations are not always literal--the originals being sometimes\r\nabridged and sometimes paraphrased.\r\n\r\nRabindranath Tagore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 1\r\n\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  Have mercy upon your servant, my queen!\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  The assembly is over and my servants are all gone.  Why\r\n   do you come at this late hour?\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  When you have finished with others, that is my time.\r\n I come to ask what remains for your last servant to do.\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  What can you expect when it is too late?\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  Make me the gardener of your flower garden.\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  What folly is this?\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  I will give up my other work.\r\n I will throw my swords and lances down in the dust.  Do not send\r\n   me to distant courts; do not bid me undertake new conquests.\r\n   But make me the gardener of your flower garden.\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  What will your duties be?\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  The service of your idle days.\r\n I will keep fresh the grassy path where you walk in the morning,\r\n   where your feet will be greeted with praise at every step by\r\n   the flowers eager for death.\r\n I will swing you in a swing among the branches of the\r\n   _saptaparna_, where the early evening moon will struggle\r\n   to kiss your skirt through the leaves.\r\n I will replenish with scented oil the lamp that burns by your\r\n   bedside, and decorate your footstool with sandal and saffron\r\n   paste in wondrous designs.\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  What will you have for your reward?\r\n\r\n SERVANT.  To be allowed to hold your little fists like tender\r\n   lotus-buds and slip flower chains over your wrists; to tinge\r\n   the soles of your feet with the red juice of _ashoka_\r\n   petals and kiss away the speck of dust that may chance to\r\n   linger there.\r\n\r\n QUEEN.  Your prayers are granted, my servant, you will be the\r\n   gardener of my flower garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Ah, poet, the evening draws near; your hair is turning grey.\r\n \"Do you in your lonely musing hear the message of the hereafter?\"\r\n\r\n \"It is evening,\" the poet said, \"and I am listening because some\r\n   one may call from the village, late though it be.\r\n \"I watch if young straying hearts meet together, and two pairs of\r\n   eager eyes beg for music to break their silence and speak for\r\n   them.\r\n \"Who is there to weave their passionate songs, if I sit on the\r\n   shore of life and contemplate death and the beyond?\r\n\r\n \"The early evening star disappears.\r\n \"The glow of a funeral pyre slowly dies by the silent river.\r\n \"Jackals cry in chorus from the courtyard of the deserted house\r\n   in the light of the worn-out moon.\r\n \"If some wanderer, leaving home, come here to watch the night and\r\n   with bowed head listen to the murmur of the darkness, who is\r\n   there to whisper the secrets of life into his ears if I,\r\n   shutting my doors, should try to free myself from mortal bonds?\r\n\r\n \"It is a trifle that my hair is turning grey.\r\n \"I am ever as young or as old as the youngest and the oldest of\r\n   this village.\r\n \"Some have smiles, sweet and simple, and some a sly twinkle in\r\n   their eyes.\r\n \"Some have tears that well up in the daylight, and others tears\r\n   that are hidden in the gloom.\r\n They all have need for me, and I have no time to brood over the\r\n   afterlife.\r\n \"I am of an age with each, what matter if my hair turns grey?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 3\r\n\r\n\r\n In the morning I cast my net into the sea.\r\n I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and\r\n   strange beauty--some shone like a smile, some glistened like\r\n   tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride.\r\n When with the day's burden I went home, my love was sitting in\r\n   the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower.\r\n I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I\r\n   had dragged up, and stood silent.\r\n She glanced at them and said, \"What strange things are these?  I\r\n   know not of what use they are!\"\r\n I bowed my head in shame and thought, \"I have not fought for\r\n   these, I did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts\r\n   for her.\"\r\n Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the\r\n   street.\r\n In the morning travellers came; they picked them up and carried\r\n   them into far countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 4\r\n\r\n\r\n Ah me, why did they build my house by the road to the market\r\n   town?\r\n They moor their laden boats near my trees.\r\n They come and go and wander at their will.\r\n I sit and watch them; my time wears on.\r\n Turn them away I cannot.  And thus my days pass by.\r\n\r\n Night and day their steps sound by my door.\r\n Vainly I cry, \"I do not know you.\"\r\n Some of them are known to my fingers, some to my nostrils, the\r\n   blood in my veins seems to know them, and some are known to my\r\n   dreams.\r\n Turn them away I cannot.  I call them and say, \"Come to my house\r\n   whoever chooses.  Yes, come.\"\r\n\r\n In the morning the bell rings in the temple.\r\n They come with their baskets in their hands.\r\n Their feet are rosy red.  The early light of dawn is on their\r\n   faces.\r\n Turn them away I cannot.  I call them and I say, \"Come to my\r\n   garden to gather flowers.  Come hither.\"\r\n\r\n In the mid-day the gong sounds at the palace gate.\r\n I know not why they leave their work and linger near my hedge.\r\n The flowers in their hair are pale and faded; the notes are\r\n   languid in their flutes.\r\n Turn them away I cannot.  I call them and say, \"The shade is cool\r\n   under my trees.  Come, friends.\"\r\n\r\n At night the crickets chirp in the woods.\r\n Who is it that comes slowly to my door and gently knocks?\r\n I vaguely see the face, not a word is spoken, the stillness of\r\n   the sky is all around.\r\n Turn away my silent guest I cannot.  I look at the face through\r\n   the dark, and hours of dreams pass by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 5\r\n\r\n\r\n I am restless.  I am athirst for far-away things.\r\n My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim\r\n   distance.\r\n O Great Beyond, O the keen call of thy flute!\r\n I forget, I ever forget, that I have no wings to fly, that I am\r\n   bound in this spot evermore.\r\n\r\n I am eager and wakeful, I am a stranger in a strange land.\r\n Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope.\r\n Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own.\r\n O Far-to-seek, O the keen call of thy flute!\r\n I forget, I ever forget, that I know not the way, that I have not\r\n   the winged horse.\r\n\r\n I am listless, I am a wanderer in my heart.\r\n In the sunny haze of the languid hours, what vast vision of thine\r\n   takes shape in the blue of the sky!\r\n O Farthest end, O the keen call of thy flute!\r\n I forget, I ever forget, that the gates are shut everywhere in\r\n   the house where I dwell alone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 6\r\n\r\n\r\n The tame bird was in a cage, the free bird was in the forest.\r\n They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.\r\n The free bird cries, \"O my love, let us fly to wood.\"\r\n The cage bird whispers, \"Come hither, let us both live in the\r\n   cage.\"\r\n Says the free bird, \"Among bars, where is there room to spread\r\n   one's wings?\"\r\n \"Alas,\" cries the cage bird, \"I should not know where to sit\r\n   perched in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n The free bird cries, \"My darling, sing the songs of the\r\n   woodlands.\"\r\n The cage bird says, \"Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of\r\n   the learned.\"\r\n The forest bird cries, \"No, ah no! songs can never be taught.\"\r\n The cage bird says, \"Alas for me, I know not the songs of the\r\n   woodlands.\"\r\n\r\n Their love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing\r\n   to wing.\r\n Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to\r\n   know each other.\r\n They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, \"Come closer, my\r\n   love!\"\r\n The free bird cries, \"It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of\r\n   the cage.\"\r\n The cage bird whispers, \"Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 7\r\n\r\n\r\n O mother, the young Prince is to pass by our door,--how can I\r\n   attend to my work this morning?\r\n Show me how to braid up my hair; tell me what garment to put on.\r\n Why do you look at me amazed, mother?\r\n I know well he will not glance up once at my window; I know he\r\n   will pass out of my sight in the twinkling of an eye; only the\r\n   vanishing strain of the flute will come sobbing to me from\r\n   afar.\r\n But the young Prince will pass by our door, and I will put on my\r\n   best for the moment.\r\n\r\n O mother, the young Prince did pass by our door, and the morning\r\n   sun flashed from his chariot.\r\n I swept aside the veil from my face, I tore the ruby chain from\r\n   my neck and flung it in his path.\r\n Why do you look at me amazed, mother?\r\n I know well he did not pick up my chain; I know it was crushed\r\n   under his wheels leaving a red stain upon the dust, and no one\r\n   knows what my gift was nor to whom.\r\n But the young Prince did pass by our door, and I flung the jewel\r\n   from my breast before his path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 8\r\n\r\n\r\n When the lamp went out by my bed I woke up with the early birds.\r\n I sat at my open window with a fresh wreath on my loose hair.\r\n The young traveller came along the road in the rosy mist of the\r\n   morning.\r\n A pearl chain was on his neck, and the sun's rays fell on his\r\n   crown.  He stopped before my door and asked me with an eager\r\n   cry, \"Where is she?\"\r\n For very shame I could not say, \"She is I, young traveller, she\r\n   is I.\"\r\n\r\n It was dusk and the lamp was not lit.\r\n I was listlessly braiding my hair.\r\n The young traveller came on his chariot in the glow of the\r\n   setting sun.\r\n His horses were foaming at the mouth, and there was dust on his\r\n   garment.\r\n He alighted at my door and asked in a tired voice, \"Where is\r\n   she?\"\r\n For very shame I could not say, \"She is I, weary traveller, she\r\n   is I.\"\r\n\r\n It is an April night.  The lamp is burning in my room.\r\n The breeze of the south comes gently.  The noisy parrot sleeps in\r\n   its cage.\r\n My bodice is of the colour of the peacock's throat, and my mantle\r\n   is green as young grass.\r\n I sit upon the floor at the window watching the deserted street.\r\n Through the dark night I keep humming, \"She is I, despairing\r\n   traveller, she is I.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 9\r\n\r\n\r\n When I go alone at night to my love-tryst, birds do not sing, the\r\n   wind does not stir, the houses on both sides of the street\r\n   stand silent.\r\n It is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and I am\r\n   ashamed.\r\n\r\n When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps, leaves do\r\n   not rustle on the trees, and the water is still in the river\r\n   like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep.\r\n It is my own heart that beats wildly--I do not know how to quiet\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and\r\n   my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the\r\n   lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars.\r\n It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light.  I\r\n   do not know how to hide it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 10\r\n\r\n\r\n Let your work be, bride.  Listen, the guest has come.\r\n Do you hear, he is gently shaking the chain which fastens the\r\n   door?\r\n See that your anklets make no loud noise, and that your step is\r\n   not over-hurried at meeting him.\r\n Let your work be, bride, the guest has come in the evening.\r\n\r\n No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, do not be frightened.\r\n It is the full moon on a night of April; shadows are pale in the\r\n   courtyard; the sky overhead is bright.\r\n Draw your veil over your face if you must, carry the lamp to the\r\n   door if you fear.\r\n No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, do not be frightened.\r\n\r\n Have no word with him if you are shy; stand aside by the door\r\n   when you meet him.\r\n If he asks you questions, and if you wish to, you can lower your\r\n   eyes in silence.\r\n Do not let your bracelets jingle when, lamp in hand, you lead him\r\n   in.\r\n Have no word with him if you are shy.\r\n\r\n Have you not finished your work yet, bride?  Listen, the guest\r\n   has come.\r\n Have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed?\r\n Have you not got ready the offering basket for the evening\r\n   service?\r\n Have you not put the red lucky mark at the parting of your hair,\r\n   and done your toilet for the night?\r\n O bride, do you hear, the guest has come?\r\n Let your work be!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 11\r\n\r\n\r\n Come as you are; do not loiter over your toilet.\r\n If your braided hair has loosened, if the parting of your hair be\r\n   not straight, if the ribbons of your bodice be not fastened, do\r\n   not mind.\r\n Come as you are; do not loiter over your toilet.\r\n\r\n Come, with quick steps over the grass.\r\n If the raddle come from your feet because of the dew, if the\r\n   rings of bells upon your feet slacken, if pearls drop out of\r\n   your chain, do not mind.\r\n Come with quick steps over the grass.\r\n\r\n Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky?\r\n Flocks of cranes fly up from the further river-bank and fitful\r\n   gusts of wind rush over the heath.\r\n The anxious cattle run to their stalls in the village.\r\n Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky?\r\n\r\n In vain you light your toilet lamp--it flickers and goes out in\r\n   the wind.\r\n Who can know that your eyelids have not been touched with lamp-\r\n   black?  For your eyes are darker than rain-clouds.\r\n In vain you light your toilet lamp--it goes out.\r\n\r\n Come as you are; do not loiter over your toilet.\r\n If the wreath is not woven, who cares; if the wrist-chain has not\r\n   been linked, let it be.\r\n The sky is overcast with clouds--it is late.\r\n Come as you are; do not loiter over your toilet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 12\r\n\r\n\r\n If you would be busy and fill your pitcher, come, O come to my\r\n   lake.\r\n The water will cling round your feet and babble its secret.\r\n The shadow of the coming rain is on the sands, and the clouds\r\n   hang low upon the blue lines of the trees like the heavy hair\r\n   above your eyebrows.\r\n I know well the rhythm of your steps, they are beating in my\r\n   heart.\r\n Come, O come to my lake, if you must fill your pitcher.\r\n\r\n If you would be idle and sit listless and let your pitcher float\r\n   on the water, come, O come to my lake.\r\n The grassy slope is green, and the wild flowers beyond number.\r\n Your thoughts will stray out of your dark eyes like birds from\r\n   their nests.\r\n Your veil will drop to your feet.\r\n Come, O come to my lake if you must sit idle.\r\n\r\n If you would leave off your play and dive in the water, come, O\r\n   come to my lake.\r\n Let your blue mantle lie on the shore; the blue water will cover\r\n   you and hide you.\r\n The waves will stand a-tiptoe to kiss your neck and whisper in\r\n   your ears.\r\n Come, O come to my lake, if you would dive in the water.\r\n\r\n If you must be mad and leap to your death, come, O come to my\r\n   lake.\r\n It is cool and fathomlessly deep.\r\n It is dark like a sleep that is dreamless.\r\n There in its depths nights and days are one, and songs are\r\n   silence.\r\n Come, O come to my lake, if you would plunge to your death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 13\r\n\r\n\r\n I asked nothing, only stood at the edge of the wood behind the\r\n   tree.\r\n Languor was still upon the eyes of the dawn, and the dew in the\r\n   air.\r\n The lazy smell of the damp grass hung in the thin mist above the\r\n   earth.\r\n Under the banyan tree you were milking the cow with your hands,\r\n   tender and fresh as butter.\r\n And I was standing still.\r\n\r\n I did not say a word.  It was the bird that sang unseen from the\r\n   thicket.\r\n The mango tree was shedding its flowers upon the village road,\r\n   and the bees came humming one by one.\r\n On the side of the pond the gate of _Shiva's_ temple was\r\n   opened and the worshipper had begun his chants.\r\n With the vessel on your lap you were milking the cow.\r\n I stood with my empty can.\r\n\r\n I did not come near you.\r\n The sky woke with the sound of the gong at the temple.\r\n The dust was raised in the road from the hoofs of the driven\r\n   cattle.\r\n With the gurgling pitchers at their hips, women came from the\r\n   river.\r\n Your bracelets were jingling, and foam brimming over the jar.\r\n The morning wore on and I did not come near you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 14\r\n\r\n\r\n I was walking by the road, I do not know why, when the noonday\r\n   was past and bamboo branches rustled in the wind.\r\n The prone shadows with their out-stretched arms clung to the feet\r\n   of the hurrying light.\r\n The _koels_ were weary of their songs.\r\n I was walking by the road, I do not know why.\r\n\r\n The hut by the side of the water is shaded by an overhanging\r\n   tree.\r\n Some one was busy with her work, and her bangles made music in\r\n   the corner.\r\n I stood before this hut, I know not why.\r\n\r\n The narrow winding road crosses many a mustard field, and many a\r\n   mango forest.\r\n It passes by the temple of the village and the market at the\r\n   river landing place.\r\n I stopped by this hut, I do not know why.\r\n\r\n Years ago it was a day of breezy March when the murmur of the\r\n   spring was languorous, and mango blossoms were dropping on the\r\n   dust.\r\n The rippling water leapt and licked the brass vessel that stood\r\n   on the landing step.\r\n I think of that day of breezy March, I do not know why.\r\n\r\n Shadows are deepening and cattle returning to their folds.\r\n The light is grey upon the lonely meadows, and the villagers are\r\n   waiting for the ferry at the bank.\r\n I slowly return upon my steps, I do not know why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 15\r\n\r\n\r\n I run as a musk-deer runs in the shadow of the forest mad with\r\n   his own perfume.\r\n The night is the night of mid-May, the breeze is the breeze of\r\n   the south.\r\n I lose my way and I wander, I seek what I cannot get, I get what\r\n   I do not seek.\r\n\r\n From my heart comes out and dances the image of my own desire.\r\n The gleaming vision flits on.\r\n I try to clasp it firmly, it eludes me and leads me astray.\r\n I seek what I cannot get, I get what I do not seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 16\r\n\r\n\r\n Hands cling to hands and eyes linger on eyes: thus begins the\r\n   record of our hearts.\r\n It is the moonlit night of March; the sweet smell of _henna_\r\n   is in the air; my flute lies on the earth neglected and your\r\n   garland of flowers in unfinished.\r\n This love between you and me is simple as a song.\r\n\r\n Your veil of the saffron colour makes my eyes drunk.\r\n The jasmine wreath that you wove me thrills to my heart like\r\n   praise.\r\n It is a game of giving and withholding, revealing and screening\r\n   again; some smiles and some little shyness, and some sweet\r\n   useless struggles.\r\n This love between you and me is simple as a song.\r\n\r\n No mystery beyond the present; no striving for the impossible; no\r\n   shadow behind the charm; no groping in the depth of the dark.\r\n This love between you and me is simple as a song.\r\n\r\n We do not stray out of all words into the ever silent; we do not\r\n   raise our hands to the void for things beyond hope.\r\n It is enough what we give and we get.\r\n We have not crushed the joy to the utmost to wring from it the\r\n   wine of pain.\r\n This love between you and me is simple as a song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 17\r\n\r\n\r\n The yellow bird sings in their tree and makes my heart dance with\r\n   gladness.\r\n We both live in the same village, and that is our one piece of\r\n   joy.\r\n Her pair of pet lambs come to graze in the shade of our garden\r\n   trees.\r\n If they stray into our barley field, I take them up in my arms.\r\n The name of our village is Khanjan, and Anjan they call our\r\n   river.\r\n My name is known to all the village, and her name is Ranjan.\r\n\r\n Only one field lies between us.\r\n Bees that have hived in our grove go to seek honey in theirs.\r\n Flowers launched from their landing-stairs come floating by the\r\n   stream where we bathe.\r\n Baskets of dried _kusm_ flowers come from their fields to\r\n   our market.\r\n The name of our village is Khanjan, and Anjan they call our\r\n   river.\r\n My name is known to all the village, and her name is Ranjan.\r\n\r\n The lane that winds to their house is fragrant in the spring with\r\n   mango flowers.\r\n When their linseed is ripe for harvest the hemp is in bloom in\r\n   our field.\r\n The stars that smile on their cottage send us the same twinkling\r\n   look.\r\n The rain that floods their tank makes glad our _kadam_\r\n   forest.\r\n The name of our village is Khanjan, and Anjan they call our\r\n   river.\r\n My name is known to all the village, and her name is Ranjan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 18\r\n\r\n\r\n When the two sisters go to fetch water, they come to this spot\r\n   and they smile.\r\n They must be aware of somebody who stands behind the trees\r\n   whenever they go to fetch water.\r\n\r\n The two sisters whisper to each other when they pass this spot.\r\n They must have guessed the secret of that somebody who stands\r\n   behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.\r\n\r\n Their pitchers lurch suddenly, and water spills when they reach\r\n   this spot.\r\n They must have found out that somebody's heart is beating who\r\n   stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.\r\n\r\n The two sisters glance at each other when they come to this spot,\r\n   and they smile.\r\n There is a laughter in their swift-stepping feet, which makes\r\n   confusion in somebody's mind who stands behind the trees\r\n   whenever they go to fetch water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 19\r\n\r\n\r\n You walked by the riverside path with the full pitcher upon your\r\n   hip.\r\n Why did you swiftly turn your face and peep at me through your\r\n   fluttering veil?\r\n That gleaming look from the dark came upon me like a breeze that\r\n   sends a shiver through the rippling water and sweeps away to\r\n   the shadowy shore.\r\n It came to me like the bird of the evening that hurriedly flies\r\n   across the lampless room from the one open window to the other,\r\n   and disappears in the night.\r\n You are hidden as a star behind the hills, and I am a passer-by\r\n   upon the road.\r\n But why did you stop for a moment and glance at my face through\r\n   your veil while you walked by the riverside path with the full\r\n   pitcher upon your hip?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 20\r\n\r\n\r\n Day after day he comes and goes away.\r\n Go, and give him a flower from my hair, my friend.\r\n If he asks who was it that sent it, I entreat you do not tell him\r\n   my name--for he only comes and goes away.\r\n\r\n He sits on the dust under the tree.\r\n Spread there a seat with flowers and leaves, my friend.\r\n His eyes are sad, and they bring sadness to my heart.\r\n He does not speak what he has in mind; he only comes and goes\r\n   away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 21\r\n\r\n\r\n Why did he choose to come to my door, the wandering youth, when\r\n   the day dawned?\r\n As I come in and out I pass by him every time, and my eyes are\r\n   caught by his face.\r\n I know not if I should speak to him or keep silent.  Why did he\r\n   choose to come to my door?\r\n\r\n The cloudy nights in July are dark; the sky is soft blue in the\r\n   autumn; the spring days are restless with the south wind.\r\n He weaves his songs with fresh tunes every time.\r\n I turn from my work and my eyes fill with the mist.  Why did he\r\n   choose to come to my door?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 22\r\n\r\n\r\n When she passed by me with quick steps, the end of her skirt\r\n   touched me.\r\n From the unknown island of a heart came a sudden warm breath of\r\n   spring.\r\n A flutter of a flitting touch brushed me and vanished in a\r\n   moment, like a torn flower petal blown in the breeze.\r\n It fell upon my heart like a sigh of her body and whisper of her\r\n   heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 23\r\n\r\n\r\n Why do you sit there and jingle your bracelets in mere idle\r\n   sport?\r\n Fill your pitcher.  It is time for you to come home.\r\n\r\n Why do you stir the water with your hands and fitfully glance at\r\n   the road for some one in mere idle sport?\r\n Fill your pitcher and come home.\r\n\r\n The morning hours pass by--the dark water flows on.\r\n The waves are laughing and whispering to each other in mere idle\r\n   sport.\r\n\r\n The wandering clouds have gathered at the edge of the sky on\r\n   yonder rise of the land.\r\n They linger and look at your face and smile in mere idle sport.\r\n Fill your pitcher and come home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 24\r\n\r\n\r\n Do not keep to yourself the secret of your heart, my friend!\r\n Say it to me, only to me, in secret.\r\n You who smile so gently, softly whisper, my heart will hear it,\r\n   not my ears.\r\n\r\n The night is deep, the house is silent, the birds' nests are\r\n   shrouded with sleep.\r\n Speak to me through hesitating tears, through faltering smiles,\r\n   through sweet shame and pain, the secret of your heart!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 25\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Come to us, youth, tell us truly why there is madness in your\r\n   eyes?\"\r\n \"I know not what wine of wild poppy I have drunk, that there is\r\n   this madness in my eyes.\"\r\n \"Ah, shame!\"\r\n \"Well, some are wise and some foolish, some are watchful and some\r\n   careless.  There are eyes that smile and eyes that weep--and\r\n   madness is in my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n \"Youth, why do you stand so still under the shadow of the tree?\"\r\n \"My feet are languid with the burden of my heart, and I stand\r\n   still in the shadow.\"\r\n \"Ah, shame!\"\r\n \"Well, some march on their way and some linger, some are free and\r\n   some are fettered--and my feet are languid with the burden of\r\n   my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 26\r\n\r\n\r\n \"What comes from your willing hands I take.  I beg for nothing\r\n   more.\"\r\n \"Yes, yes, I know you, modest mendicant, you ask for all that one\r\n   has.\"\r\n\r\n \"If there be a stray flower for me I will wear it in my heart.\"\r\n \"But if there be thorns?\"\r\n \"I will endure them.\"\r\n \"Yes, yes, I know you, modest mendicant, you ask for all that one\r\n   has.\"\r\n\r\n \"If but once you should raise your loving eyes to my face it\r\n   would make my life sweet beyond death.\"\r\n \"But if there by only cruel glances?\"\r\n \"I will keep them piercing my heart.\"\r\n \"Yes, yes, I know you, modest mendicant, you ask for all that one\r\n   has.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 27\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Trust love even if it brings sorrow.  Do not close up your\r\n   heart.\"\r\n \"Ah no, my friend, your words are dark, I cannot understand\r\n   them.\"\r\n\r\n \"The heart is only for giving away with a tear and a song, my\r\n   love.\"\r\n \"Ah no, my friend, your words are dark, I cannot understand\r\n   them.\"\r\n\r\n \"Pleasure is frail like a dewdrop, while it laughs it dies.  But\r\n   sorrow is strong and abiding.  Let sorrowful love wake in your\r\n   eyes.\"\r\n \"Ah no, my friend, your words are dark, I cannot understand\r\n   them.\"\r\n\r\n \"The lotus blooms in the sight of the sun, and loses all that it\r\n   has.  It would not remain in bud in the eternal winter mist.\"\r\n \"Ah no, my friend, your words are dark, I cannot understand\r\n   them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 28\r\n\r\n\r\n Your questioning eyes are sad.  They seek to know my meaning as\r\n   the moon would fathom the sea.\r\n I have bared my life before your eyes from end to end, with\r\n   nothing hidden or held back.  That is why you know me not.\r\n If it were only a gem I could break it into a hundred pieces and\r\n   string them into a chain to put on your neck.\r\n If it were only a flower, round and small and sweet, I could\r\n   pluck it from its stem to set it in your hair.\r\n But it is a heart, my beloved.  Where are its shores and its\r\n   bottom?\r\n You know not the limits of this kingdom, still you are its queen.\r\n If it were only a moment of pleasure it would flower in an easy\r\n   smile, and you could see it and read it in a moment.\r\n If it were merely a pain it would melt in limpid tears,\r\n  reflecting its inmost secret without a word.\r\n But it is love, my beloved.\r\n Its pleasure and pain are boundless, and endless its wants and\r\n   wealth.\r\n It is as near to you as your life, but you can never wholly know\r\n   it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 29\r\n\r\n\r\n Speak to me, my love!  Tell me in words what you sang.\r\n The night is dark.  The stars are lost in clouds.  The wind is\r\n   sighing through the leaves.\r\n I will let loose my hair.  My blue cloak will cling round me like\r\n   night.  I will clasp your head to my bosom; and there in the\r\n   sweet loneliness murmur on your heart.  I will shut my eyes and\r\n   listen.  I will not look in your face.\r\n When your words are ended, we will sit still and silent.  Only\r\n   the trees will whisper in the dark.\r\n The night will pale.  The day will dawn.  We shall look at each\r\n   other's eyes and go on our different paths.\r\n Speak to me, my love!  Tell me in words what you sang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 30\r\n\r\n\r\n You are the evening cloud floating in the sky of my dreams.\r\n I paint you and fashion you ever with my love longings.\r\n You are my own, my own, Dweller in my endless dreams!\r\n\r\n Your feet are rosy-red with the glow of my heart's desire,\r\n   Gleaner of my sunset songs!\r\n Your lips are bitter-sweet with the taste of my wine of pain.\r\n You are my own, my own, Dweller in my lonesome dreams!\r\n\r\n With the shadow of my passion have I darkened your eyes, Haunter\r\n   of the depth of my gaze!\r\n I have caught you and wrapt you, my love, in the net of my music.\r\n You are my own, my own, Dweller in my deathless dreams!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 31\r\n\r\n\r\n My heart, the bird of the wilderness, has found its sky in your\r\n   eyes.\r\n They are the cradle of the morning, they are the kingdom of the\r\n   stars.\r\n My songs are lost in their depths.\r\n Let me but soar in that sky, in its lonely immensity.\r\n Let me but cleave its clouds and spread wings in its sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 32\r\n\r\n\r\n Tell me if this be all true, my lover, tell me if this be true.\r\n When these eyes flash their lightning the dark clouds in your\r\n   breast make stormy answer.\r\n Is it true that my lips are sweet like the opening bud of the\r\n   first conscious love?\r\n Do the memories of vanished months of May linger in my limbs?\r\n Does the earth, like a harp, shiver into songs with the touch of\r\n   my feet?\r\n Is it then true that the dewdrops fall from the eyes of night\r\n   when I am seen, and the morning light is glad when it wraps my\r\n   body round?\r\n Is it true, is it true, that your love travelled alone through\r\n   ages and worlds in search of me?\r\n That when you found me at last, your age-long desire found utter\r\n   peace in my gentle speech and my eyes and lips and flowing\r\n   hair?\r\n Is it then true that the mystery of the Infinite is written on\r\n   this little forehead of mine?\r\n Tell me, my lover, if all this be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 33\r\n\r\n\r\n I love you, beloved.  Forgive me my love.\r\n Like a bird losing its way I am caught.\r\n When my heart was shaken it lost its veil and was naked.  Cover\r\n   it with pity, beloved, and forgive me my love.\r\n\r\n If you cannot love me, beloved, forgive me my pain.\r\n Do not look askance at me from afar.\r\n I will steal back to my corner and sit in the dark.\r\n With both hands I will cover my naked shame.\r\n Turn your face from me, beloved, and forgive me my pain.\r\n\r\n If you love me, beloved, forgive me my joy.\r\n When my heart is borne away by the flood of happiness, do not\r\n   smile at my perilous abandonment.\r\n When I sit on my throne and rule you with my tyranny of love,\r\n   when like a goddess I grant you my favour, bear with my pride,\r\n   beloved, and forgive me my joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 34\r\n\r\n\r\n Do not go, my love, without asking my leave.\r\n I have watched all night, and now my eyes are heavy with sleep.\r\n I fear lest I lose you when I am sleeping.\r\n Do not go, my love, without asking my leave.\r\n\r\n I start up and stretch my hands to touch you.  I ask myself, \"Is\r\n   it a dream?\"\r\n Could I but entangle your feet with my heart and hold them fast\r\n   to my breast!\r\n Do not go, my love, without asking my leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 35\r\n\r\n\r\n Lest I should know you too easily, you play with me.\r\n You blind me with flashes of laughter to hide your tears.\r\n I know, I know your art.\r\n You never say the word you would.\r\n\r\n Lest I should not prize you, you elude me in a thousand ways.\r\n Lest I should confuse you with the crowd, you stand aside.\r\n I know, I know your art,\r\n You never walk the path you would.\r\n\r\n Your claim is more than that of others, that is why you are\r\n   silent.\r\n With playful carelessness you avoid my gifts.\r\n I know, I know your art,\r\n You never will take what you would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 36\r\n\r\n\r\n He whispered, \"My love, raise your eyes.\"\r\n I sharply chid him, and said \"Go!\"; but he did not stir.\r\n He stood before me and held both my hands.  I said, \"Leave me!\";\r\n   but he did not go.\r\n\r\n He brought his face near my ear.  I glanced at him and said,\r\n   \"What a shame!\"; but he did not move.\r\n His lips touched my cheek.  I trembled and said, \"You dare too\r\n   much;\" but he had no shame.\r\n\r\n He put a flower in my hair.  I said, \"It is useless!\"; but he\r\n   stood unmoved.\r\n He took the garland from my neck and went away.  I weep and ask\r\n   my heart, \"Why does he not come back?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 37\r\n\r\n\r\n Would you put your wreath of fresh flowers on my neck, fair one?\r\n But you must know that the one wreath that I had woven is for the\r\n   many, for those who are seen in glimpses, or dwell in lands\r\n   unexplored, or live in poets' songs.\r\n\r\n It is too late to ask my heart in return for yours.\r\n There was a time when my life was like a bud, all its perfume was\r\n   stored in its core.\r\n Now it is squandered far and wide.\r\n Who knows the enchantment that can gather and shut it up again?\r\n My heart is not mine to give to one only, it is given to the\r\n   many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 38\r\n\r\n\r\n My love, once upon a time your poet launched a great epic in his\r\n   mind.\r\n Alas, I was not careful, and it struck your ringing anklets and\r\n   came to grief.\r\n It broke up into scraps of songs and lay scattered at your feet.\r\n All my cargo of the stories of old wars was tossed by the\r\n   laughing waves and soaked in tears and sank.\r\n You must make this loss good to me, my love.\r\n If my claims to immortal fame after death are shattered, make me\r\n   immortal while I live.\r\n And I will not mourn for my loss nor blame you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 39\r\n\r\n\r\n I try to weave a wreath all the morning, but the flowers slip and\r\n   they drop out.\r\n You sit there watching me in secret through the corner of your\r\n   prying eyes.\r\n Ask those eyes, darkly planning mischief, whose fault it was.\r\n\r\n I try to sing a song, but in vain.\r\n A hidden smile trembles on your lips, ask of it the reason of my\r\n   failure.\r\n Let your smiling lips say on oath how my voice lost itself in\r\n   silence like a drunken bee in the lotus.\r\n\r\n It is evening, and the time for the flowers to close their\r\n   petals.\r\n Give me leave to sit by your side, and bid my lips to do the work\r\n   that can be done in silence and in the dim light of stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 40\r\n\r\n\r\n An unbelieving smile flits on your eyes when I come to you to\r\n   take my leave.\r\n I have done it so often that you think I will soon return.\r\n To tell you the truth I have the same doubt in my mind.\r\n For the spring days come again time after time; the full moon\r\n   takes leave and comes on another visit, the flowers come again\r\n   and blush upon their branches year after year, and it is likely\r\n   that I take my leave only to come to you again.\r\n But keep the illusion awhile; do not send it away with ungentle\r\n   haste.\r\n When I say I leave you for all time, accept it as true, and let a\r\n   mist of tears for one moment deepen the dark rim of your eyes.\r\n Then smile as archly as you like when I come again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 41\r\n\r\n\r\n I long to speak the deepest words I have to say to you; but I\r\n   dare not, for fear you should laugh.\r\n That is why I laugh at myself and shatter my secret in jest.\r\n I make light of my pain, afraid you should do so.\r\n\r\n I long to tell you the truest words I have to say to you; but I\r\n   dare not, being afraid that you would not believe them.\r\n That is why I disguise them in untruth, saying the contrary of\r\n   what I mean.\r\n I make my pain appear absurd, afraid that you should do so.\r\n\r\n I long to use the most precious words I have for you; but I dare\r\n   not, fearing I should not be paid with like value.\r\n That is why I gave you hard names and boast of my callous\r\n   strength.\r\n I hurt you, for fear you should never know any pain.\r\n\r\n I long to sit silent by you; but I dare not lest my heart come\r\n   out at my lips.\r\n That is why I prattle and chatter lightly and hide my heart\r\n   behind words.\r\n I rudely handle my pain, for fear you should do so.\r\n\r\n I long to go away from your side; but I dare not, for fear my\r\n   cowardice should become known to you.\r\n That is why I hold my head high and carelessly come into your\r\n   presence.\r\n Constant thrusts from your eyes keep my pain fresh for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 42\r\n\r\n\r\n O mad, superbly drunk;\r\n If you kick open your doors and play the fool in public;\r\n If you empty your bag in a night, and snap your fingers at\r\n   prudence;\r\n If you walk in curious paths and play with useless things;\r\n Reck not rhyme or reason;\r\n If unfurling your sails before the storm you snap the rudder in\r\n   two,\r\n Then I will follow you, comrade, and be drunken and go to the\r\n   dogs.\r\n\r\n I have wasted my days and nights in the company of steady wise\r\n   neighbours.\r\n Much knowing has turned my hair grey, and much watching has made\r\n   my sight dim.\r\n For years I have gathered and heaped up scraps and fragments of\r\n   things;\r\n Crush them and dance upon them, and scatter them all to the\r\n   winds.\r\n For I know 'tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go to the\r\n   dogs.\r\n\r\n Let all crooked scruples vanish, let me hopelessly lose my way.\r\n Let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my\r\n   anchors.\r\n The world is peopled with worthies, and workers, useful and\r\n   clever.\r\n There are men who are easily first, and men who come decently\r\n   after.\r\n Let them be happy and prosper, and let me be foolishly futile.\r\n For I know 'tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the\r\n   dogs.\r\n\r\n I swear to surrender this moment all claims to the ranks of the\r\n   decent.\r\n I let go my pride of learning and judgment of right and of wrong.\r\n I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering the last drop of tears.\r\n With the foam of the berry-red wine I will bathe and brighten my\r\n   laughter.\r\n The badge of the civil and staid I'll tear into shreds for the\r\n   nonce.\r\n I'll take the holy vow to be worthless, to be drunken and go to\r\n   the dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 43\r\n\r\n\r\n No, my friends, I shall never be an ascetic, whatever you may say.\r\n I shall never be an ascetic if she does not take the vow with me.\r\n It is my firm resolve that if I cannot find a shady shelter and a\r\n   companion for my penance, I shall never turn ascetic.\r\n\r\n No, my friends, I shall never leave my hearth and home, and\r\n   retire into the forest solitude, if rings no merry laughter in\r\n   its echoing shade and if the end of no saffron mantle flutters\r\n   in the wind; if its silence is not deepened by soft whispers.\r\n I shall never be an ascetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 44\r\n\r\n\r\n Reverend sir, forgive this pair of sinners.  Spring winds to-day\r\n   are blowing in wild eddies, driving dust and dead leaves away,\r\n   and with them your lessons are all lost.\r\n Do not say, father, that life is a vanity.\r\n For we have made truce with death for once, and only for a few\r\n   fragrant hours we two have been made immortal.\r\n\r\n Even if the king's army came and fiercely fell upon us we should\r\n   sadly shake our heads and say, Brothers, you are disturbing us.\r\n   If you must have this noisy game, go and clatter your arms\r\n   elsewhere.  Since only for a few fleeting moments we have been\r\n   made immortal.\r\n\r\n If friendly people came and flocked around us, we should humbly\r\n   bow to them and say, This extravagant good fortune is an\r\n   embarrassment to us.  Room is scarce in the infinite sky where\r\n   we dwell.  For in the springtime flowers come in crowds, and\r\n   the busy wings of bees jostle each other.  Our little heaven,\r\n   where dwell only we two immortals, is too absurdly narrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 45\r\n\r\n\r\n To the guests that must go bid God's speed and brush away all\r\n   traces of their steps.\r\n Take to your bosom with a smile what is easy and simple and near.\r\n To-day is the festival of phantoms that know not when they die.\r\n Let your laughter be but a meaningless mirth like twinkles of\r\n   light on the ripples.\r\n Let your life lightly dance on the edges of Time like dew on the\r\n   tip of a leaf.\r\n Strike in chords from your harp fitful momentary rhythms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 46\r\n\r\n\r\n You left me and went on your way.\r\n I thought I should mourn for you and set your solitary image in\r\n   my heart wrought in a golden song.\r\n But ah, my evil fortune, time is short.\r\n\r\n Youth wanes year after year; the spring days are fugitive; the\r\n   frail flowers die for nothing, and the wise man warns me that\r\n   life is but a dew-drop on the lotus leaf.\r\n Should I neglect all this to gaze after one who has turned her\r\n   back on me?\r\n That would be rude and foolish, for time is short.\r\n\r\n Then, come, my rainy nights with pattering feet; smile, my golden\r\n   autumn; come, careless April, scattering your kisses abroad.\r\n You come, and you, and you also!\r\n My loves, you know we are mortals.  Is it wise to break one's\r\n   heart for the one who takes her heart away?  For time is short.\r\n\r\n It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse and write in rhymes that\r\n   you are all my world.\r\n It is heroic to hug one's sorrow and determine not to be\r\n   consoled.\r\n But a fresh face peeps across my door and raises its eyes to my\r\n   eyes.\r\n I cannot but wipe away my tears and change the tune of my song.\r\n For time is short.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 47\r\n\r\n\r\n If you would have it so, I will end my singing.\r\n If it sets your heart aflutter, I will take away my eyes from\r\n   your face.\r\n If it suddenly startles you in your walk, I will step aside and\r\n   take another path.\r\n If it confuses you in your flower-weaving, I will shun your\r\n   lonely garden.\r\n If it makes the water wanton and wild, I will not row my boat by\r\n   your bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 48\r\n\r\n\r\n Free me from the bonds of your sweetness, my love!  No more of\r\n   this wine of kisses.\r\n This mist of heavy incense stifles my heart.\r\n Open the doors, make room for the morning light.\r\n I am lost in you, wrapped in the folds of your caresses.\r\n Free me from your spells, and give me back the manhood to offer\r\n   you my freed heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 49\r\n\r\n\r\n I hold her hands and press her to my breast.\r\n I try to fill my arms with her loveliness, to plunder her sweet\r\n   smile with kisses, to drink her dark glances with my eyes.\r\n Ah, but, where is it?  Who can strain the blue from the sky?\r\n I try to grasp the beauty, it eludes me, leaving only the body in\r\n   my hands.\r\n Baffled and weary I come back.\r\n How can the body touch the flower which only the spirit may\r\n   touch?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 50\r\n\r\n\r\n Love, my heart longs day and night for the meeting with you--for\r\n   the meeting that is like all-devouring death.\r\n Sweep me away like a storm; take everything I have; break open my\r\n   sleep and plunder my dreams.  Rob me of my world.\r\n In that devastation, in the utter nakedness of spirit, let us\r\n   become one in beauty.\r\n Alas for my vain desire!  Where is this hope for union except in\r\n   thee, my God?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 51\r\n\r\n\r\n Then finish the last song and let us leave.\r\n Forget this night when the night is no more.\r\n Whom do I try to clasp in my arms?  Dreams can never be made\r\n   captive.\r\n My eager hands press emptiness to my heart and it bruises my\r\n   breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 52\r\n\r\n\r\n Why did the lamp go out?\r\n I shaded it with my cloak to save it from the wind, that is why\r\n   the lamp went out.\r\n\r\n Why did the flower fade?\r\n I pressed it to my heart with anxious love, that is why the\r\n   flower faded.\r\n\r\n Why did the stream dry up?\r\n I put a dam across it to have it for my use, that is why the\r\n   stream dried up.\r\n\r\n Why did the harp-string break?\r\n I tried to force a note that was beyond its power, that is why\r\n   the harp-string is broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 53\r\n\r\n\r\n Why do you put me to shame with a look?\r\n I have not come as a beggar.\r\n Only for a passing hour I stood at the end of your courtyard\r\n   outside the garden hedge.\r\n Why do you put me to shame with a look?\r\n\r\n Not a rose did I gather from your garden, not a fruit did I\r\n   pluck.\r\n I humbly took my shelter under the wayside shade where every\r\n   strange traveller may stand.\r\n Not a rose did I pluck.\r\n\r\n Yes, my feet were tired, and the shower of rain come down.\r\n The winds cried out among the swaying bamboo branches.\r\n The clouds ran across the sky as though in the flight from\r\n   defeat.\r\n My feet were tired.\r\n\r\n I know not what you thought of me or for whom you were waiting at\r\n   your door.\r\n Flashes of lightning dazzled your watching eyes.\r\n How could I know that you could see me where I stood in the dark?\r\n I know not what you thought of me.\r\n\r\n The day is ended, and the rain has ceased for a moment.\r\n I leave the shadow of the tree at the end of your garden and this\r\n   seat on the grass.\r\n It has darkened; shut your door; I go my way.\r\n The day is ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 54\r\n\r\n\r\n Where do you hurry with your basket this late evening when the\r\n   marketing is over?\r\n They all have come home with their burdens; the moon peeps from\r\n   above the village trees.\r\n The echoes of the voices calling for the ferry run across the\r\n   dark water to the distant swamp where wild ducks sleep.\r\n Where do you hurry with your basket when the marketing is over?\r\n\r\n Sleep has laid her fingers upon the eyes of the earth.\r\n The nests of the crows have become silent, and the murmurs of the\r\n   bamboo leaves are silent.\r\n The labourers home from their fields spread their mats in the\r\n   courtyards.\r\n Where do you hurry with your basket when the marketing is over?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 55\r\n\r\n\r\n It was mid-day when you went away.\r\n The sun was strong in the sky.\r\n I had done my work and sat alone on my balcony when you went\r\n   away.\r\n\r\n Fitful gusts came winnowing through the smells of many distant\r\n   fields.\r\n The doves cooed tireless in the shade, and a bee strayed in my\r\n   room humming the news of many distant fields.\r\n\r\n The village slept in the noonday heat.  The road lay deserted.\r\n In sudden fits the rustling of the leaves rose and died.\r\n I glazed at the sky and wove in the blue the letters of a name I\r\n   had known, while the village slept in the noonday heat.\r\n\r\n I had forgotten to braid my hair.  The languid breeze played with\r\n   it upon my cheek.\r\n The river ran unruffled under the shady bank.\r\n The lazy white clouds did not move.\r\n I had forgotten to braid my hair.\r\n\r\n It was mid-day when you went away.\r\n The dust of the road was hot and the fields panting.\r\n The doves cooed among the dense leaves.\r\n I was alone in my balcony when you went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 56\r\n\r\n\r\n I was one among many women busy with the obscure daily tasks of\r\n   the household.\r\n Why did you single me out and bring me away from the cool shelter\r\n   of our common life?\r\n\r\n Love unexpressed in sacred.  It shines like gems in the gloom of\r\n   the hidden heart.  In the light of the curious day it looks\r\n   pitifully dark.\r\n Ah, you broke through the cover of my heart and dragged my\r\n   trembling love into the open place, destroying for ever the\r\n   shady corner where it hid its nest.\r\n\r\n The other women are the same as ever.\r\n No one has peeped into their inmost being, and they themselves\r\n   know not their own secret.\r\n Lightly they smile, and weep, chatter, and work.  Daily they go\r\n   to the temple, light their lamps, and fetch water from the\r\n   river.\r\n\r\n I hoped my love would be saved from the shivering shame of the\r\n   shelterless, but you turn your face away.\r\n Yes, your path lies open before you, but you have cut off my\r\n   return, and left me stripped naked before the world with its\r\n   lidless eyes staring night and day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 57\r\n\r\n\r\n I plucked your flower, O world!\r\n I pressed it to my heart and the thorn pricked.\r\n When the day waned and it darkened, I found that the flower had\r\n   faded, but the pain remained.\r\n\r\n More flowers will come to you with perfume and pride, O world!\r\n But my time for flower-gathering is over, and through the dark\r\n   night I have not my rose, only the pain remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 58\r\n\r\n\r\n One morning in the flower garden a blind girl came to offer me a\r\n   flower chain in the cover of a lotus leaf.\r\n I put it round my neck, and tears came to my eyes.\r\n I kissed her and said, \"You are blind even as the flowers are.\r\n You yourself know not how beautiful is your gift.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 59\r\n\r\n\r\n O woman, you are not merely the handiwork of God, but also of\r\n   men; these are ever endowing you with beauty from their hearts.\r\n Poets are weaving for you a web with threads of golden imagery;\r\n   painters are giving your form ever new immortality.\r\n The sea gives its pearls, the mines their gold, the summer\r\n   gardens their flowers to deck you, to cover you, to make you\r\n   more precious.\r\n The desire of men's hearts has shed its glory over your youth.\r\n You are one half woman and one half dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 60\r\n\r\n\r\n Amidst the rush and roar of life, O Beauty, carved in stone, you\r\n   stand mute and still, alone and aloof.\r\n Great Time sits enamoured at your feet and murmurs:\r\n \"Speak, speak to me, my love; speak, my bride!\"\r\n But your speech is shut up in stone, O Immovable Beauty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 61\r\n\r\n\r\n Peace, my heart, let the time for the parting be sweet.\r\n Let it not be a death but completeness.\r\n Let love melt into memory and pain into songs.\r\n Let the flight through the sky end in the folding of the wings\r\n   over the nest.\r\n Let the last touch of your hands be gentle like the flower of the\r\n   night.\r\n Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a moment, and say your last\r\n   words in silence.\r\n I bow to you and hold up my lamp to light you on your way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 62\r\n\r\n\r\n In the dusky path of a dream I went to seek the love who was mine\r\n   in a former life.\r\n\r\n Her house stood at the end of a desolate street.\r\n In the evening breeze her pet peacock sat drowsing on its perch,\r\n   and the pigeons were silent in their corner.\r\n\r\n She set her lamp down by the portal and stood before me.\r\n She raised her large eyes to my face and mutely asked, \"Are you\r\n   well, my friend?\"\r\n I tried to answer, but our language had been lost and forgotten.\r\n\r\n I thought and thought; our names would not come to my mind.\r\n Tears shone in her eyes.  She held up her right hand to me.  I\r\n   took it and stood silent.\r\n\r\n Our lamp had flickered in the evening breeze and died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 63\r\n\r\n\r\n Traveller, must you go?\r\n The night is still and the darkness swoons upon the forest.\r\n The lamps are bright in our balcony, the flowers all fresh, and\r\n   the youthful eyes still awake.\r\n Is the time for your parting come?\r\n Traveller, must you go?\r\n\r\n We have not bound your feet with our entreating arms.\r\n Your doors are open.  Your horse stands saddled at the gate.\r\n If we have tried to bar your passage it was but with our songs.\r\n Did we ever try to hold you back it was but with our eyes.\r\n Traveller, we are helpless to keep you.  We have only our tears.\r\n\r\n What quenchless fire glows in your eyes?\r\n What restless fever runs in your blood?\r\n What call from the dark urges you?\r\n What awful incantation have you read among the stars in the sky,\r\n   that with a sealed secret message the night entered your heart,\r\n   silent and strange?\r\n\r\n If you do not care for merry meetings, if you must have peace,\r\n   weary heart, we shall put our lamps out and silence our harps.\r\n We shall sit still in the dark in the rustle of leaves, and the\r\n   tired moon will shed pale rays on your window.\r\n O traveller, what sleepless spirit has touched you from the heart\r\n   of the mid-night?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 64\r\n\r\n\r\n I spent my day on the scorching hot dust of the road.\r\n Now, in the cool of the evening, I knock at the door of the inn.\r\n   It is deserted and in ruins.\r\n A grim _ashath_ tree spreads its hungry clutching roots\r\n   through the gaping fissures of the walls.\r\n\r\n Days have been when wayfarers came here to wash their weary feet.\r\n They spread their mats in the courtyard in the dim light of the\r\n   early moon, and sat and talked of strange lands.\r\n They work refreshed in the morning when birds made them glad, and\r\n   friendly flowers nodded their heads at them from the wayside.\r\n\r\n But no lighted lamp awaited me when I came here.\r\n The black smudges of smoke left by many a forgotten evening lamp\r\n   stare, like blind eyes, from the wall.\r\n Fireflies flit in the bush near the dried-up pond, and bamboo\r\n   branches fling their shadows on the grass-grown path.\r\n I am the guest of no one at the end of my day.\r\n The long night is before me, and I am tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 65\r\n\r\n\r\n Is that your call again?\r\n The evening has come.  Weariness clings around me like the arms\r\n   of entreating love.\r\n Do you call me?\r\n\r\n I had given all my day to you, cruel mistress, must you also rob\r\n   me of my night?\r\n Somewhere there is an end to everything, and the loneness of the\r\n   dark is one's own.\r\n Must your voice cut through it and smite me?\r\n\r\n Has the evening no music of sleep at your gate?\r\n Do the silent-winged stars never climb the sky above your\r\n   pitiless tower?\r\n Do the flowers never drop on the dust in soft death in your\r\n   garden?\r\n\r\n Must you call me, you unquiet one?\r\n Then let the sad eyes of love vainly watch and weep.\r\n Let the lamp burn in the lonely house.\r\n Let the ferry-boat take the weary labourers to their home.\r\n I leave behind my dreams and I hasten to your call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 66\r\n\r\n\r\n A wandering madman was seeking the touchstone, with matted locks\r\n   tawny and dust-laden, and body worn to a shadow, his lips\r\n   tight-pressed, like the shut-up doors of his heart, his burning\r\n   eyes like the lamp of a glow-worm seeking its mate.\r\n\r\n Before him the endless ocean roared.\r\n The garrulous waves ceaselessly talked of hidden treasures,\r\n   mocking the ignorance that knew not their meaning.\r\n Maybe he now had no hope remaining, yet he would not rest, for\r\n   the search had become his life,--\r\n Just as the ocean for ever lifts its arms to the sky for the\r\n   unattainable--\r\n Just as the stars go in circles, yet seeking a goal that can\r\n   never be reached--\r\n Even so on the lonely shore the madman with dusty tawny locks\r\n   still roamed in search of the touchstone.\r\n\r\n One day a village boy came up and asked, \"Tell me, where did you\r\n   come at this golden chain about your waist?\"\r\n The madman started--the chain that once was iron was verily gold;\r\n   it was not a dream, but he did not know when it had changed.\r\n He struck his forehead wildly--where, O where had he without\r\n   knowing it achieved success?\r\n It had grown into a habit, to pick up pebbles and touch the\r\n   chain, and to throw them away without looking to see if a\r\n   change had come; thus the madman found and lost the touchstone.\r\n The sun was sinking low in the west, the sky was of gold.\r\n The madman returned on his footsteps to seek anew the lost\r\n   treasure, with his strength gone, his body bent, and his heart\r\n   in the dust, like a tree uprooted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 67\r\n\r\n\r\n Though the evening comes with slow steps and has signalled for\r\n   all songs to cease;\r\n Though your companions have gone to their rest and you are tired;\r\n Though fear broods in the dark and the face of the sky is veiled;\r\n Yet, bird, O my bird, listen to me, do not close your wings.\r\n\r\n That is not the gloom of the leaves of the forest, that is the\r\n   sea swelling like a dark black snake.\r\n That is not the dance of the flowering jasmine, that is flashing\r\n   foam.\r\n Ah, where is the sunny green shore, where is your nest?\r\n Bird, O my bird, listen to me, do not close your wings.\r\n\r\n The lone night lies along your path, the dawn sleeps behind the\r\n   shadowy hills.\r\n The stars hold their breath counting the hours, the feeble moon\r\n   swims the deep night.\r\n Bird, O my bird, listen to me, do not close your wings.\r\n\r\n There is no hope, no fear for you.\r\n There is no word, no whisper, no cry.\r\n There is no home, no bed for rest.\r\n There is only your own pair of wings and the pathless sky.\r\n Bird, O my bird, listen to me, do not close your wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 68\r\n\r\n\r\n None lives for ever, brother, and nothing lasts for long.  Keep\r\n   that in mind and rejoice.\r\n Our life is not the one old burden, our path is not the one long\r\n   journey.\r\n One sole poet has not to sing one aged song.\r\n The flower fades and dies; but he who wears the flower has not to\r\n   mourn for it for ever.\r\n Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.\r\n\r\n There must come a full pause to weave perfection into music.\r\n Life droops toward its sunset to be drowned in the golden\r\n   shadows.\r\n Love must be called from its play to drink sorrow and be borne to\r\n   the heaven of tears.\r\n Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.\r\n\r\n We hasten to gather our flowers lest they are plundered by the\r\n   passing winds.\r\n It quickens our blood and brightens our eyes to snatch kisses\r\n   that would vanish if we delayed.\r\n Our life is eager, our desires are keen, for time tolls the bell\r\n   of parting.\r\n Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.\r\n\r\n There is not time for us to clasp a thing and crush it and fling\r\n   it away to the dust.\r\n The hours trip rapidly away, hiding their dreams in their skirts.\r\n Our life is short; it yields but a few days for love.\r\n Were it for work and drudgery it would be endlessly long.\r\n Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.\r\n\r\n Beauty is sweet to us, because she dances to the same fleeting\r\n   tune with our lives.\r\n Knowledge is precious to us, because we shall never have time to\r\n   complete it.\r\n All is done and finished in the eternal Heaven.\r\n But earth's flowers of illusion are kept eternally fresh by\r\n   death.\r\n Brother, keep that in mind and rejoice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 69\r\n\r\n\r\n I hunt for the golden stag.\r\n You may smile, my friends, but I pursue the vision that eludes\r\n   me.\r\n I run across hills and dales, I wander through nameless lands,\r\n   because I am hunting for the golden stag.\r\n You come and buy in the market and go back to your homes laden\r\n   with goods, but the spell of the homeless winds has touched me\r\n   I know not when and where.\r\n I have no care in my heart; all my belongings I have left far\r\n   behind me.\r\n I run across hills and dales, I wander through nameless lands--\r\n   because I am hunting for the golden stag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 70\r\n\r\n\r\n I remember a day in my childhood I floated a paper boat in the\r\n   ditch.\r\n It was a wet day of July; I was alone and happy over my play.\r\n I floated my paper boat in the ditch.\r\n\r\n Suddenly the storm clouds thickened, winds came in gusts, and\r\n   rain poured in torrents.\r\n Rills of muddy water rushed and swelled the stream and sunk my\r\n   boat.\r\n Bitterly I thought in my mind that the storm came on purpose to\r\n   spoil my happiness; all its malice was against me.\r\n\r\n The cloudy day of July is long today, and I have been musing over\r\n   all those games in life wherein I was loser.\r\n I was blaming my fate for the many tricks it played on me, when\r\n   suddenly I remembered the paper boat that sank in the ditch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 71\r\n\r\n\r\n The day is not yet done, the fair is not over, the fair on the\r\n   river-bank.\r\n I had feared that my time had been squandered and my last penny\r\n   lost.\r\n But no, my brother, I have still something left.  My fate has not\r\n   cheated me of everything.\r\n\r\n The selling and buying are over.\r\n All the dues on both sides have been gathered in, and it is time\r\n   for me to go home.\r\n But, gatekeeper, do you ask for your toll?\r\n Do not fear, I have still something left.  My fate has not\r\n   cheated me of everything.\r\n\r\n The lull in the wind threatens storm, and the lowering clouds in\r\n   the west bode no good.\r\n The hushed water waits for the wind.\r\n I hurry to cross the river before the night overtakes me.\r\n O ferryman, you want your fee!\r\n Yes, brother, I have still something left.  My fate has not\r\n   cheated me of everything.\r\n\r\n In the wayside under the tree sits the beggar.  Alas, he looks at\r\n   my face with a timid hope!\r\n He thinks I am rich with the day's profit.\r\n Yes, brother, I have still something left.  My fate has not\r\n   cheated me of everything.\r\n\r\n The night grows dark and the road lonely.  Fireflies gleam among\r\n   the leaves.\r\n Who are you that follow me with stealthy silent steps?\r\n Ah, I know, it is your desire to rob me of all my gains.  I will\r\n   not disappoint you!\r\n For I still have something left, and my fate has not cheated me\r\n   of everything.\r\n\r\n At midnight I reach home.  My hands are empty.\r\n You are waiting with anxious eyes at my door, sleepless and\r\n   silent.\r\n Like a timorous bird you fly to my breast with eager love.\r\n Ay, ay, my God, much remains still.  My fate has not cheated me\r\n   of everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 72\r\n\r\n\r\n With days of hard travail I raised a temple.  It had no doors or\r\n   windows, its walls were thickly built with massive stones.\r\n I forgot all else, I shunned all the world, I gazed in rapt\r\n   contemplation at the image I had set upon the altar.\r\n It was always night inside, and lit by the lamps of perfumed oil.\r\n The ceaseless smoke of incense wound my heart in its heavy coils.\r\n Sleepless, I carved on the walls fantastic figures in mazy\r\n   bewildering lines--winged horses, flowers with human faces,\r\n   women with limbs like serpents.\r\n No passage was left anywhere through which could enter the song\r\n   of birds, the murmur of leaves or hum of the busy village.\r\n The only sound that echoed in its dark dome was that of\r\n   incantations which I chanted.\r\n My mind became keen and still like a pointed flame, my senses\r\n   swooned in ecstasy.\r\n I knew not how time passed till the thunderstone had struck the\r\n   temple, and a pain stung me through the heart.\r\n\r\n The lamp looked pale and ashamed; the carvings on the walls, like\r\n   chained dreams, stared meaningless in the light as they would\r\n   fain hide themselves.\r\n I looked at the image on the altar.  I saw it smiling and alive\r\n   with the living touch of God.  The night I had imprisoned had\r\n   spread its wings and vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 73\r\n\r\n\r\n Infinite wealth is not yours, my patient and dusky mother dust!\r\n You toil to fill the mouths of your children, but food is scarce.\r\n The gift of gladness that you have for us is never perfect.\r\n The toys that you make for your children are fragile.\r\n You cannot satisfy all our hungry hopes, but should I desert you\r\n   for that?\r\n Your smile which is shadowed with pain is sweet to my eyes.\r\n Your love which knows not fulfilment is dear to my heart.\r\n From your breast you have fed us with life but not immortality,\r\n   that is why your eyes are ever wakeful.\r\n For ages you are working with colour and song, yet your heaven is\r\n   not built, but only its sad suggestion.\r\n Over your creations of beauty there is the mist of tears.\r\n I will pour my songs into your mute heart, and my love into your\r\n   love.\r\n I will worship you with labour.\r\n I have seen your tender face and I love your mournful dust,\r\n   Mother Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 74\r\n\r\n\r\n In the world's audience hall, the simple blade of grass sits on\r\n   the same carpet with the sunbeam and the stars of midnight.\r\n Thus my songs share their seats in the heart of the world with\r\n   the music of the clouds and forests.\r\n But, you man of riches, your wealth has no part in the simple\r\n   grandeur of the sun's glad gold and the mellow gleam of the\r\n   musing moon.\r\n The blessing of all-embracing sky is not shed upon it.\r\n And when death appears, it pales and withers and crumbles into\r\n   dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 75\r\n\r\n\r\n At midnight the would-be ascetic announced:\r\n \"This is the time to give up my home and seek for God.  Ah, who\r\n   has held me so long in delusion here?\"\r\n God whispered, \"I,\" but the ears of the man were stopped.\r\n With a baby asleep at her breast lay his wife, peacefully\r\n   sleeping on one side of the bed.\r\n The man said, \"Who are ye that have fooled me so long?\"\r\n The voice said again, \"They are God,\" but he heard it not.\r\n The baby cried out in its dream, nestling close to its mother.\r\n God commanded, \"Stop, fool, leave not thy home,\" but still he\r\n   heard not.\r\n God sighed and complained, \"Why does my servant wander to seek\r\n   me, forsaking me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 76\r\n\r\n\r\n The fair was on before the temple.  It had rained from the early\r\n   morning and the day came to its end.\r\n Brighter than all the gladness of the crowd was the bright smile\r\n   of a girl who bought for a farthing a whistle of palm leaf.\r\n The shrill joy of that whistle floated above all laughter and\r\n   noise.\r\n An endless throng of people came and jostled together.  The road\r\n   was muddy, the river in flood, the field under water in\r\n   ceaseless rain.\r\n Greater than all the troubles of the crowd was a little boy's\r\n   trouble--he had not a farthing to buy a painted stick.\r\n His wistful eyes gazing at the shop made this whole meeting of\r\n   men so pitiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 77\r\n\r\n\r\n The workman and his wife from the west country are busy digging\r\n   to make bricks for the kiln.\r\n Their little daughter goes to the landing-place by the river;\r\n   there she has no end of scouring and scrubbing of pots and\r\n   pans.\r\n Her little brother, with shaven head and brown, naked, mud-\r\n   covered limbs, follows after her and waits patiently on the\r\n   high bank at her bidding.\r\n She goes back home with the full pitcher poised on her head, the\r\n   shining brass pot in her left hand, holding the child with her\r\n   right--she the tiny servant of her mother, grave with the\r\n   weight of the household cares.\r\n\r\n One day I saw this naked boy sitting with legs outstretched.\r\n In the water his sister sat rubbing a drinking-pot with a handful\r\n   of earth, turning it round and round.\r\n Near by a soft-haired lamb stood gazing along the bank.\r\n It came close to where the boy sat and suddenly bleated aloud,\r\n   and the child started up and screamed.\r\n His sister left off cleaning her pot and ran up.\r\n She took up her brother in one arm and the lamb in the other, and\r\n   dividing her caresses between them bound in one bond of\r\n   affection the offspring of beast and man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 78\r\n\r\n\r\n It was in May.  The sultry noon seemed endlessly long.  The dry\r\n   earth gaped with thirst in the heat.\r\n When I heard from the riverside a voice calling, \"Come, my\r\n   darling!\"\r\n I shut my book and opened the window to look out.\r\n I saw a big buffalo with mud-stained hide, standing near the\r\n   river with placid, patient eyes; and a youth, knee deep in\r\n   water, calling it to its bath.\r\n I smiled amused and felt a touch of sweetness in my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 79\r\n\r\n\r\n I often wonder where lie hidden the boundaries of recognition\r\n   between man and the beast whose heart knows no spoken language.\r\n Through what primal paradise in a remote morning of creation ran\r\n   the simple path by which their hearts visited each other.\r\n Those marks of their constant tread have not been effaced though\r\n   their kinship has been long forgotten.\r\n Yet suddenly in some wordless music the dim memory wakes up and\r\n   the beast gazes into the man's face with a tender trust, and\r\n   the man looks down into its eyes with amused affection.\r\n It seems that the two friends meet masked and vaguely know each\r\n   other through the disguise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 80\r\n\r\n\r\n With a glance of your eyes you could plunder all the wealth of\r\n   songs struck from poets' harps, fair woman!\r\n But for their praises you have no ear, therefore I come to praise\r\n   you.\r\n You could humble at your feet the proudest heads in the world.\r\n But it is your loved ones, unknown to fame, whom you choose to\r\n   worship, therefore I worship you.\r\n The perfection of your arms would add glory to kingly splendour\r\n   with their touch.\r\n But you use them to sweep away the dust, and to make clean your\r\n   humble home, therefore I am filled with awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 81\r\n\r\n\r\n Why do you whisper so faintly in my ears, O Death, my Death?\r\n When the flowers droop in the evening and cattle come back to\r\n   their stalls, you stealthily come to my side and speak words\r\n   that I do not understand.\r\n Is this how you must woo and win me with the opiate of drowsy\r\n   murmur and cold kisses, O Death, my Death?\r\n\r\n Will there be no proud ceremony for our wedding?\r\n Will you not tie up with a wreath your tawny coiled locks?\r\n Is there none to carry your banner before you, and will not the\r\n   night be on fire with your red torch-lights, O Death, my Death?\r\n\r\n Come with your conch-shells sounding, come in the sleepless\r\n   night.\r\n Dress me with a crimson mantle, grasp my hand and take me.\r\n Let your chariot be ready at my door with your horses neighing\r\n   impatiently.\r\n Raise my veil and look at my face proudly, O Death, my Death!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 82\r\n\r\n\r\n We are to play the game of death to-night, my bride and I.\r\n The night is black, the clouds in the sky are capricious, and the\r\n   waves are raving at sea.\r\n We have left our bed of dreams, flung open the door and come out,\r\n   my bride and I.\r\n We sit upon a swing, and the storm winds give us a wild push from\r\n   behind.\r\n My bride starts up with fear and delight, she trembles and clings\r\n   to my breast.\r\n Long have I served her tenderly.\r\n I made for her a bed of flowers and I closed the doors to shut\r\n   out the rude light from her eyes.\r\n I kissed her gently on her lips and whispered softly in her ears\r\n   till she half swooned in languor.\r\n She was lost in the endless mist of vague sweetness.\r\n She answered not to my touch, my songs failed to arouse her.\r\n To-night has come to us the call of the storm from the wild.\r\n My bride has shivered and stood up, she has clasped my hand and\r\n   come out.\r\n Her hair is flying in the wind, her veil is fluttering, her\r\n   garland rustles over her breast.\r\n The push of death has swung her into life.\r\n We are face to face and heart to heart, my bride and I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 83\r\n\r\n\r\n She dwelt on the hillside by the edge of a maize-field, near the\r\n   spring that flows in laughing rills through the solemn shadows\r\n   of ancient trees.  The women came there to fill their jars, and\r\n   travellers would sit there to rest and talk.  She worked and\r\n   dreamed daily to the tune of the bubbling stream.\r\n\r\n One evening the stranger came down from the cloud-hidden peak;\r\n   his locks were tangled like drowsy snakes.  We asked in wonder,\r\n   \"Who are you?\"  He answered not but sat by the garrulous stream\r\n   and silently gazed at the hut where she dwelt.  Our hearts\r\n   quaked in fear and we came back home when it was night.\r\n\r\n Next morning when the women came to fetch water at the spring by\r\n   the _deodar_ trees, they found the doors open in her hut,\r\n   but her voice was gone and where was her smiling face?  The\r\n   empty jar lay on the floor and her lamp had burnt itself out in\r\n   the corner.  No one knew where she had fled to before it was\r\n   morning--and the stranger had gone.\r\n\r\n In the month of May the sun grew strong and the snow melted, and\r\n   we sat by the spring and wept.  We wondered in our mind, \"Is\r\n   there a spring in the land where she has gone and where she can\r\n   fill her vessel in these hot thirsty days?\"  And we asked each\r\n   other in dismay, \"Is there a land beyond these hills where we\r\n   live?\"\r\n\r\n It was a summer night; the breeze blew from the south; and I sat\r\n   in her deserted room where the lamp stood still unlit.  When\r\n   suddenly from before my eyes the hills vanished like curtains\r\n   drawn aside.  \"Ah, it is she who comes.  How are you, my child?\r\n   Are you happy?  But where can you shelter under this open sky?\r\n   And, alas, our spring is not here to allay your thirst.\"\r\n\r\n \"Here is the same sky,\" she said, \"only free from the fencing\r\n   hills,--this is the same stream grown into a river,--the same\r\n   earth widened into a plain.\"  \"Everything is here,\" I sighed,\r\n   \"only we are not.\"  She smiled sadly and said, \"You are in my\r\n   heart.\"  I woke up and heard the babbling of the stream and the\r\n   rustling of the _deodars_ at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 84\r\n\r\n\r\n Over the green and yellow rice-fields sweep the shadows of the\r\n   autumn clouds followed by the swift chasing sun.\r\n The bees forget to sip their honey; drunken with light they\r\n   foolishly hover and hum.\r\n The ducks in the islands of the river clamour in joy for mere\r\n   nothing.\r\n Let none go back home, brothers, this morning, let none go to\r\n   work.\r\n Let us take the blue sky by storm and plunder space as we run.\r\n Laughter floats in the air like foam on the flood.\r\n Brothers, let us squander our morning in futile songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 85\r\n\r\n\r\n Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?\r\n I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the\r\n   spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.\r\n Open your doors and look abroad.\r\n From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the\r\n   vanished flowers of an hundred years before.\r\n In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang\r\n   one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred\r\n   years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n INDEX OF FIRST WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                No.\r\n  A wandering madman was seeking the

B. YEATS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\nWILLIAM ROTHENSTEIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago I said to a distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine, “I\r\nknow no German, yet if a translation of a German poet had moved me, I\r\nwould go to the British Museum and find books in English that would\r\ntell me something of his life, and of the history of his thought. But\r\nthough these prose translations from Rabindranath Tagore have stirred\r\nmy blood as nothing has for years, I shall not know anything of his\r\nlife, and of the movements of thought that have made them possible, if\r\nsome Indian traveller will not tell me.” It seemed to him natural that\r\nI should be moved, for he said, “I read Rabindranath every day, to read\r\none line of his is to forget all the troubles of the world.” I said,\r\n“An Englishman living in London in the reign of Richard the Second had\r\nhe been shown translations from Petrarch or from Dante, would have\r\nfound no books to answer his questions, but would have questioned some\r\nFlorentine banker or Lombard merchant as I question you. For all I\r\nknow, so abundant and simple is this poetry, the new renaissance has\r\nbeen born in your country and I shall never know of it except by\r\nhearsay.” He answered, “We have other poets, but none that are his\r\nequal; we call this the epoch of Rabindranath. No poet seems to me as\r\nfamous in Europe as he is among us. He is as great in music as in\r\npoetry, and his songs are sung from the west of India into Burma\r\nwherever Bengali is spoken. He was already famous at nineteen when he\r\nwrote his first novel; and plays when he was but little older, are\r\nstill played in Calcutta. I so much admire the completeness of his\r\nlife; when he was very young he wrote much of natural objects, he would\r\nsit all day in his garden; from his twenty-fifth year or so to his\r\nthirty-fifth perhaps, when he had a great sorrow, he wrote the most\r\nbeautiful love poetry in our language,” and then he said with deep\r\nemotion, “words can never express what I owed at seventeen to his love\r\npoetry. After that his art grew deeper, it became religious and\r\nphilosophical; all the inspiration of mankind are in his hymns. He is\r\nthe first among our saints who has not refused to live, but has spoken\r\nout of Life itself, and that is why we give him our love.” I may have\r\nchanged his well-chosen words in my memory but not his thought. “A\r\nlittle while ago he was to read divine service in one of our\r\nchurches—we of the Brahma Samaj use your word ‘church’ in English—it\r\nwas the largest in Calcutta and not only was it crowded, but the\r\nstreets were all but impassable because of the people.”\r\n\r\nOther Indians came to see me and their reverence for this man sounded\r\nstrange in our world, where we hide great and little things under the\r\nsame veil of obvious comedy and half-serious depreciation. When we were\r\nmaking the cathedrals had we a like reverence for our great men? “Every\r\nmorning at three—I know, for I have seen it”—one said to me, “he sits\r\nimmovable in contemplation, and for two hours does not awake from his\r\nreverie upon the nature of God. His father, the Maha Rishi, would\r\nsometimes sit there all through the next day; once, upon a river, he\r\nfell into contemplation because of the beauty of the landscape, and the\r\nrowers waited for eight hours before they could continue their\r\njourney.” He then told me of Mr. Tagore’s family and how for\r\ngenerations great men have come out of its cradles. “Today,” he said,\r\n“there are Gogonendranath and Abanindranath Tagore, who are artists;\r\nand Dwijendranath, Rabindranath’s brother, who is a great philosopher.\r\nThe squirrels come from the boughs and climb on to his knees and the\r\nbirds alight upon his hands.” I notice in these men’s thought a sense\r\nof visible beauty and meaning as though they held that doctrine of\r\nNietzsche that we must not believe in the moral or intellectual beauty\r\nwhich does not sooner or later impress itself upon physical things. I\r\nsaid, “In the East you know how to keep a family illustrious. The other\r\nday the curator of a museum pointed out to me a little dark-skinned man\r\nwho was arranging their Chinese prints and said, “That is the\r\nhereditary connoisseur of the Mikado, he is the fourteenth of his\r\nfamily to hold the post.’” He answered, “When Rabindranath was a boy he\r\nhad all round him in his home literature and music.” I thought of the\r\nabundance, of the simplicity of the poems, and said, “In your country\r\nis there much propagandist writing, much criticism? We have to do so\r\nmuch, especially in my own country, that our minds gradually cease to\r\nbe creative, and yet we cannot help it. If our life was not a continual\r\nwarfare, we would not have taste, we would not know what is good, we\r\nwould not find hearers and readers. Four-fifths of our energy is spent\r\nin the quarrel with bad taste, whether in our own minds or in the minds\r\nof others.” “I understand,” he replied, “we too have our propagandist\r\nwriting. In the villages they recite long mythological poems adapted\r\nfrom the Sanskrit in the Middle Ages, and they often insert passages\r\ntelling the people that they must do their duties.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI have carried the manuscript of these translations about with me for\r\ndays, reading it in railway trains, or on the top of omnibuses and in\r\nrestaurants, and I have often had to close it lest some stranger would\r\nsee how much it moved me. These lyrics— which are in the original, my\r\nIndians tell me, full of subtlety of rhythm, of untranslatable\r\ndelicacies of colour, of metrical invention—display in their thought a\r\nworld I have dreamed of all my live long. The work of a supreme\r\nculture, they yet appear as much the growth of the common soil as the\r\ngrass and the rushes. A tradition, where poetry and religion are the\r\nsame thing, has passed through the centuries, gathering from learned\r\nand unlearned metaphor and emotion, and carried back again to the\r\nmultitude the thought of the scholar and of the noble. If the\r\ncivilization of Bengal remains unbroken, if that common mind which—as\r\none divines—runs through all, is not, as with us, broken into a dozen\r\nminds that know nothing of each other, something even of what is most\r\nsubtle in these verses will have come, in a few generations, to the\r\nbeggar on the roads. When there was but one mind in England, Chaucer\r\nwrote his _Troilus and Cressida_, and thought he had written to be\r\nread, or to be read out—for our time was coming on apace—he was sung by\r\nminstrels for a while. Rabindranath Tagore, like Chaucer’s forerunners,\r\nwrites music for his words, and one understands at every moment that he\r\nis so abundant, so spontaneous, so daring in his passion, so full of\r\nsurprise, because he is doing something which has never seemed strange,\r\nunnatural, or in need of defence. These verses will not lie in little\r\nwell-printed books upon ladies’ tables, who turn the pages with\r\nindolent hands that they may sigh over a life without meaning, which is\r\nyet all they can know of life, or be carried by students at the\r\nuniversity to be laid aside when the work of life begins, but, as the\r\ngenerations pass, travellers will hum them on the highway and men\r\nrowing upon the rivers. Lovers, while they await one another, shall\r\nfind, in murmuring them, this love of God a magic gulf wherein their\r\nown more bitter passion may bathe and renew its youth. At every moment\r\nthe heart of this poet flows outward to these without derogation or\r\ncondescension, for it has known that they will understand; and it has\r\nfilled itself with the circumstance of their lives. The traveller in\r\nthe read-brown clothes that he wears that dust may not show upon him,\r\nthe girl searching in her bed for the petals fallen from the wreath of\r\nher royal lover, the servant or the bride awaiting the master’s\r\nhome-coming in the empty house, are images of the heart turning to God.\r\nFlowers and rivers, the blowing of conch shells, the heavy rain of the\r\nIndian July, or the moods of that heart in union or in separation; and\r\na man sitting in a boat upon a river playing lute, like one of those\r\nfigures full of mysterious meaning in a Chinese picture, is God\r\nHimself. A whole people, a whole civilization, immeasurably strange to\r\nus, seems to have been taken up into this imagination; and yet we are\r\nnot moved because of its strangeness, but because we have met our own\r\nimage, as though we had walked in Rossetti’s willow wood, or heard,\r\nperhaps for the first time in literature, our voice as in a dream.\r\n\r\nSince the Renaissance the writing of European saints—however familiar\r\ntheir metaphor and the general structure of their thought—has ceased to\r\nhold our attention. We know that we must at last forsake the world, and\r\nwe are accustomed in moments of weariness or exaltation to consider a\r\nvoluntary forsaking; but how can we, who have read so much poetry, seen\r\nso many paintings, listened to so much music, where the cry of the\r\nflesh and the cry of the soul seems one, forsake it harshly and rudely?\r\nWhat have we in common with St. Bernard covering his eyes that they may\r\nnot dwell upon the beauty of the lakes of Switzerland, or with the\r\nviolent rhetoric of the Book of Revelations? We would, if we might,\r\nfind, as in this book, words full of courtesy. “I have got my leave.\r\nBid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all and take my departure.\r\nHere I give back the keys of my door—and I give up all claims to my\r\nhouse. I only ask for last kind words from you. We were neighbours for\r\nlong, but I received more than I could give. Now the day has dawned and\r\nthe lamp that lit my dark corner is out. A summons has come and I am\r\nready for my journey.” And it is our own mood, when it is furthest from\r\nA Kempis or John of the Cross, that cries, “And because I love this\r\nlife, I know I shall love death as well.” Yet it is not only in our\r\nthoughts of the parting that this book fathoms all. We had not known\r\nthat we loved God, hardly it may be that we believed in Him; yet\r\nlooking backward upon our life we discover, in our exploration of the\r\npathways of woods, in our delight in the lonely places of hills, in\r\nthat mysterious claim that we have made, unavailingly on the woman that\r\nwe have loved, the emotion that created this insidious sweetness.\r\n“Entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to\r\nme, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a\r\nfleeting moment.” This is no longer the sanctity of the cell and of the\r\nscourge; being but a lifting up, as it were, into a greater intensity\r\nof the mood of the painter, painting the dust and the sunlight, and we\r\ngo for a like voice to St. Francis and to William Blake who have seemed\r\nso alien in our violent history.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe write long books where no page perhaps has any quality to make\r\nwriting a pleasure, being confident in some general design, just as we\r\nfight and make money and fill our heads with politics—all dull things\r\nin the doing—while Mr. Tagore, like the Indian civilization itself, has\r\nbeen content to discover the soul and surrender himself to its\r\nspontaneity. He often seems to contrast life with that of those who\r\nhave loved more after our fashion, and have more seeming weight in the\r\nworld, and always humbly as though he were only sure his way is best\r\nfor him: “Men going home glance at me and smile and fill me with shame.\r\nI sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and when they\r\nask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them not.” At\r\nanother time, remembering how his life had once a different shape, he\r\nwill say, “Many an hour I have spent in the strife of the good and the\r\nevil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to\r\ndraw my heart on to him; and I know not why this sudden call to what\r\nuseless inconsequence.” An innocence, a simplicity that one does not\r\nfind elsewhere in literature makes the birds and the leaves seem as\r\nnear to him as they are near to children, and the changes of the\r\nseasons great events as before our thoughts had arisen between them and\r\nus. At times I wonder if he has it from the literature of Bengal or\r\nfrom religion, and at other times, remembering the birds alighting on\r\nhis brother’s hands, I find pleasure in thinking it hereditary, a\r\nmystery that was growing through the centuries like the courtesy of a\r\nTristan or a Pelanore. Indeed, when he is speaking of children, so much\r\na part of himself this quality seems, one is not certain that he is not\r\nalso speaking of the saints, “They build their houses with sand and\r\nthey play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their\r\nboats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their\r\nplay on the seashore of worlds. They know not how to swim, they know\r\nnot how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in\r\ntheir ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They\r\nseek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.”\r\n\r\nW.B. YEATS\r\n\r\n\r\n_September_ 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGITANJALI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou\r\nemptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.\r\n\r\nThis little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and\r\nhast breathed through it melodies eternally new.\r\n\r\nAt the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in\r\njoy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.\r\n\r\nThy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine.\r\nAges pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen thou commandest me to sing it seems that my heart would break with\r\npride; and I look to thy face, and tears come to my eyes.\r\n\r\nAll that is harsh and dissonant in my life melts into one sweet\r\nharmony—and my adoration spreads wings like a glad bird on its flight\r\nacross the sea.\r\n\r\nI know thou takest pleasure in my singing. I know that only as a singer\r\nI come before thy presence.\r\n\r\nI touch by the edge of the far-spreading wing of my song thy feet which\r\nI could never aspire to reach.\r\n\r\nDrunk with the joy of singing I forget myself and call thee friend who\r\nart my lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know not how thou singest, my master! I ever listen in silent\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nThe light of thy music illumines the world. The life breath of thy\r\nmusic runs from sky to sky. The holy stream of thy music breaks through\r\nall stony obstacles and rushes on.\r\n\r\nMy heart longs to join in thy song, but vainly struggles for a voice. I\r\nwould speak, but speech breaks not into song, and I cry out baffled.\r\nAh, thou hast made my heart captive in the endless meshes of thy music,\r\nmy master!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of my life, I shall ever try to keep my body pure, knowing that\r\nthy living touch is upon all my limbs.\r\n\r\nI shall ever try to keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing\r\nthat thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nI shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love\r\nin flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the inmost shrine of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnd it shall be my endeavour to reveal thee in my actions, knowing it\r\nis thy power gives me strength to act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\r\nI ask for a moment’s indulgence to sit by thy side. The works that I\r\nhave in hand I will finish afterwards.\r\n\r\nAway from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and\r\nmy work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil.\r\n\r\nToday the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and\r\nthe bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering\r\ngrove.\r\n\r\nNow it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing\r\ndedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n\r\nPluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it droop\r\nand drop into the dust.\r\n\r\nI may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of\r\npain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am\r\naware, and the time of offering go by.\r\n\r\nThough its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower\r\nin thy service and pluck it while there is time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy song has put off her adornments. She has no pride of dress and\r\ndecoration. Ornaments would mar our union; they would come between thee\r\nand me; their jingling would drown thy whispers.\r\n\r\nMy poet’s vanity dies in shame before thy sight. O master poet, I have\r\nsat down at thy feet. Only let me make my life simple and straight,\r\nlike a flute of reed for thee to fill with music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child who is decked with prince’s robes and who has jewelled chains\r\nround his neck loses all pleasure in his play; his dress hampers him at\r\nevery step.\r\n\r\nIn fear that it may be frayed, or stained with dust he keeps himself\r\nfrom the world, and is afraid even to move.\r\n\r\nMother, it is no gain, thy bondage of finery, if it keep one shut off\r\nfrom the healthful dust of the earth, if it rob one of the right of\r\nentrance to the great fair of common human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\n\r\nO Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! O beggar, to come\r\nbeg at thy own door!\r\n\r\nLeave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all, and never look\r\nbehind in regret.\r\n\r\nThy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its\r\nbreath. It is unholy—take not thy gifts through its unclean hands.\r\nAccept only what is offered by sacred love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is thy footstool and there rest thy feet where live the poorest,\r\nand lowliest, and lost.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to bow to thee, my obeisance cannot reach down to the depth\r\nwhere thy feet rest among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.\r\n\r\nPride can never approach to where thou walkest in the clothes of the\r\nhumble among the poorest, and lowliest, and lost.\r\n\r\nMy heart can never find its way to where thou keepest company with the\r\ncompanionless among the poorest, the lowliest, and the lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! Whom dost thou\r\nworship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut?\r\nOpen thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee!\r\n\r\nHe is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground and where the\r\npathmaker is breaking stones. He is with them in sun and in shower, and\r\nhis garment is covered with dust. Put of thy holy mantle and even like\r\nhim come down on the dusty soil!\r\n\r\nDeliverance? Where is this deliverance to be found? Our master himself\r\nhas joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; he is bound with us\r\nall for ever.\r\n\r\nCome out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense!\r\nWhat harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? Meet him\r\nand stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long.\r\n\r\nI came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my\r\nvoyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a\r\nstar and planet.\r\n\r\nIt is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that\r\ntraining is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a\r\ntune.\r\n\r\nThe traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and\r\none has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost\r\nshrine at the end.\r\n\r\nMy eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said “Here art\r\nthou!”\r\n\r\nThe question and the cry “Oh, where?” melt into tears of a thousand\r\nstreams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance “I am!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day.\r\n\r\nI have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument.\r\n\r\nThe time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; only\r\nthere is the agony of wishing in my heart.\r\n\r\nThe blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by.\r\n\r\nI have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; only I have\r\nheard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house.\r\n\r\nThe livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; but the\r\nlamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house.\r\n\r\nI live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy desires are many and my cry is pitiful, but ever didst thou save me\r\nby hard refusals; and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life\r\nthrough and through.\r\n\r\nDay by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, great gifts that\r\nthou gavest to me unasked—this sky and the light, this body and the\r\nlife and the mind—saving me from perils of overmuch desire.\r\n\r\nThere are times when I languidly linger and times when I awaken and\r\nhurry in search of my goal; but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before\r\nme.\r\n\r\nDay by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by refusing\r\nme ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am here to sing thee songs. In this hall of thine I have a corner\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nIn thy world I have no work to do; my useless life can only break out\r\nin tunes without a purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour strikes for thy silent worship at the dark temple of\r\nmidnight, command me, my master, to stand before thee to sing.\r\n\r\nWhen in the morning air the golden harp is tuned, honour me, commanding\r\nmy presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have had my invitation to this world’s festival, and thus my life has\r\nbeen blessed. My eyes have seen and my ears have heard.\r\n\r\nIt was my part at this feast to play upon my instrument, and I have\r\ndone all I could.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask, has the time come at last when I may go in and see thy face\r\nand offer thee my silent salutation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am only waiting for love to give myself up at last into his hands.\r\nThat is why it is so late and why I have been guilty of such omissions.\r\n\r\nThey come with their laws and their codes to bind me fast; but I evade\r\nthem ever, for I am only waiting for love to give myself up at last\r\ninto his hands.\r\n\r\nPeople blame me and call me heedless; I doubt not they are right in\r\ntheir blame.\r\n\r\nThe market day is over and work is all done for the busy. Those who\r\ncame to call me in vain have gone back in anger. I am only waiting for\r\nlove to give myself up at last into his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\n\r\nClouds heap upon clouds and it darkens. Ah, love, why dost thou let me\r\nwait outside at the door all alone?\r\n\r\nIn the busy moments of the noontide work I am with the crowd, but on\r\nthis dark lonely day it is only for thee that I hope.\r\n\r\nIf thou showest me not thy face, if thou leavest me wholly aside, I\r\nknow not how I am to pass these long, rainy hours.\r\n\r\nI keep gazing on the far-away gloom of the sky, and my heart wanders\r\nwailing with the restless wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure\r\nit. I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil and its\r\nhead bent low with patience.\r\n\r\nThe morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, and thy voice\r\npour down in golden streams breaking through the sky.\r\n\r\nThen thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds’\r\nnests, and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest\r\ngroves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I\r\nknew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.\r\n\r\nOnly now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my\r\ndream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind.\r\n\r\nThat vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to\r\nme that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nI knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this\r\nperfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must launch out my boat. The languid hours pass by on the shore—Alas\r\nfor me!\r\n\r\nThe spring has done its flowering and taken leave. And now with the\r\nburden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger.\r\n\r\nThe waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane\r\nthe yellow leaves flutter and fall.\r\n\r\nWhat emptiness do you gaze upon! Do you not feel a thrill passing\r\nthrough the air with the notes of the far-away song floating from the\r\nother shore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the deep shadows of the rainy July, with secret steps, thou walkest,\r\nsilent as night, eluding all watchers.\r\n\r\nToday the morning has closed its eyes, heedless of the insistent calls\r\nof the loud east wind, and a thick veil has been drawn over the\r\never-wakeful blue sky.\r\n\r\nThe woodlands have hushed their songs, and doors are all shut at every\r\nhouse. Thou art the solitary wayfarer in this deserted street. Oh my\r\nonly friend, my best beloved, the gates are open in my house—do not\r\npass by like a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love, my friend?\r\nThe sky groans like one in despair.\r\n\r\nI have no sleep tonight. Ever and again I open my door and look out on\r\nthe darkness, my friend!\r\n\r\nI can see nothing before me. I wonder where lies thy path!\r\n\r\nBy what dim shore of the ink-black river, by what far edge of the\r\nfrowning forest, through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading\r\nthy course to come to me, my friend?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the day is done, if birds sing no more, if the wind has flagged\r\ntired, then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, even as thou hast\r\nwrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep and tenderly closed the\r\npetals of the drooping lotus at dusk.\r\n\r\nFrom the traveller, whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage\r\nis ended, whose garment is torn and dustladen, whose strength is\r\nexhausted, remove shame and poverty, and renew his life like a flower\r\nunder the cover of thy kindly night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the night of weariness let me give myself up to sleep without\r\nstruggle, resting my trust upon thee.\r\n\r\nLet me not force my flagging spirit into a poor preparation for thy\r\nworship.\r\n\r\nIt is thou who drawest the veil of night upon the tired eyes of the day\r\nto renew its sight in a fresher gladness of awakening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe came and sat by my side but I woke not. What a cursed sleep it was,\r\nO miserable me!\r\n\r\nHe came when the night was still; he had his harp in his hands, and my\r\ndreams became resonant with its melodies.\r\n\r\nAlas, why are my nights all thus lost? Ah, why do I ever miss his sight\r\nwhose breath touches my sleep?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight, oh where is the light? Kindle it with the burning fire of\r\ndesire!\r\n\r\nThere is the lamp but never a flicker of a flame—is such thy fate, my\r\nheart? Ah, death were better by far for thee!\r\n\r\nMisery knocks at thy door, and her message is that thy lord is wakeful,\r\nand he calls thee to the love-tryst through the darkness of night.\r\n\r\nThe sky is overcast with clouds and the rain is ceaseless. I know not\r\nwhat this is that stirs in me—I know not its meaning.\r\n\r\nA moment’s flash of lightning drags down a deeper gloom on my sight,\r\nand my heart gropes for the path to where the music of the night calls\r\nme.\r\n\r\nLight, oh where is the light! Kindle it with the burning fire of\r\ndesire! It thunders and the wind rushes screaming through the void. The\r\nnight is black as a black stone. Let not the hours pass by in the dark.\r\nKindle the lamp of love with thy life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28.\r\n\r\n\r\nObstinate are the trammels, but my heart aches when I try to break\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFreedom is all I want, but to hope for it I feel ashamed.\r\n\r\nI am certain that priceless wealth is in thee, and that thou art my\r\nbest friend, but I have not the heart to sweep away the tinsel that\r\nfills my room.\r\n\r\nThe shroud that covers me is a shroud of dust and death; I hate it, yet\r\nhug it in love.\r\n\r\nMy debts are large, my failures great, my shame secret and heavy; yet\r\nwhen I come to ask for my good, I quake in fear lest my prayer be\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. I am ever\r\nbusy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into the\r\nsky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.\r\n\r\nI take pride in this great wall, and I plaster it with dust and sand\r\nlest a least hole should be left in this name; and for all the care I\r\ntake I lose sight of my true being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30.\r\n\r\n\r\nI came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me\r\nin the silent dark?\r\n\r\nI move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not.\r\n\r\nHe makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his\r\nloud voice to every word that I utter.\r\n\r\nHe is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed\r\nto come to thy door in his company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?”\r\n\r\n“It was my master,” said the prisoner. “I thought I could outdo\r\neverybody in the world in wealth and power, and I amassed in my own\r\ntreasure-house the money due to my king. When sleep overcame me I lay\r\nupon the bed that was for my lord, and on waking up I found I was a\r\nprisoner in my own treasure-house.”\r\n\r\n“Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?”\r\n\r\n“It was I,” said the prisoner, “who forged this chain very carefully. I\r\nthought my invincible power would hold the world captive leaving me in\r\na freedom undisturbed. Thus night and day I worked at the chain with\r\nhuge fires and cruel hard strokes. When at last the work was done and\r\nthe links were complete and unbreakable, I found that it held me in its\r\ngrip.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. But\r\nit is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, and thou\r\nkeepest me free.\r\n\r\nLest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. But day passes\r\nby after day and thou art not seen.\r\n\r\nIf I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart, thy\r\nlove for me still waits for my love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was day they came into my house and said, “We shall only take\r\nthe smallest room here.”\r\n\r\nThey said, “We shall help you in the worship of your God and humbly\r\naccept only our own share in his grace”; and then they took their seat\r\nin a corner and they sat quiet and meek.\r\n\r\nBut in the darkness of night I find they break into my sacred shrine,\r\nstrong and turbulent, and snatch with unholy greed the offerings from\r\nGod’s altar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet only that little be left of me whereby I may name thee my all.\r\n\r\nLet only that little be left of my will whereby I may feel thee on\r\nevery side, and come to thee in everything, and offer to thee my love\r\nevery moment.\r\n\r\nLet only that little be left of me whereby I may never hide thee.\r\n\r\nLet only that little of my fetters be left whereby I am bound with thy\r\nwill, and thy purpose is carried out in my life—and that is the fetter\r\nof thy love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the mind is without fear and the head is held high;\r\n\r\nWhere knowledge is free;\r\n\r\nWhere the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow\r\ndomestic walls;\r\n\r\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth;\r\n\r\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\r\n\r\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary\r\ndesert sand of dead habit;\r\n\r\nWhere the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and\r\naction—\r\n\r\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my prayer to thee, my lord—strike, strike at the root of penury\r\nin my heart.\r\n\r\nGive me the strength lightly to bear my joys and sorrows.\r\n\r\nGive me the strength to make my love fruitful in service.\r\n\r\nGive me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before\r\ninsolent might.\r\n\r\nGive me the strength to raise my mind high above daily trifles.\r\n\r\nAnd give me the strength to surrender my strength to thy will with\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my\r\npower,—that the path before me was closed, that provisions were\r\nexhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity.\r\n\r\nBut I find that thy will knows no end in me. And when old words die out\r\non the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the\r\nold tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat I want thee, only thee—let my heart repeat without end. All\r\ndesires that distract me, day and night, are false and empty to the\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nAs the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, even\r\nthus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry—I want thee, only\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nAs the storm still seeks its end in peace when it strikes against peace\r\nwith all its might, even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love and\r\nstill its cry is—I want thee, only thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nWhen grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song.\r\n\r\nWhen tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from\r\nbeyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest.\r\n\r\nWhen my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open\r\nthe door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.\r\n\r\nWhen desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one,\r\nthou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain has held back for days and days, my God, in my arid heart. The\r\nhorizon is fiercely naked—not the thinnest cover of a soft cloud, not\r\nthe vaguest hint of a distant cool shower.\r\n\r\nSend thy angry storm, dark with death, if it is thy wish, and with\r\nlashes of lightning startle the sky from end to end.\r\n\r\nBut call back, my lord, call back this pervading silent heat, still and\r\nkeen and cruel, burning the heart with dire despair.\r\n\r\nLet the cloud of grace bend low from above like the tearful look of the\r\nmother on the day of the father’s wrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere dost thou stand behind them all, my lover, hiding thyself in the\r\nshadows? They push thee and pass thee by on the dusty road, taking thee\r\nfor naught. I wait here weary hours spreading my offerings for thee,\r\nwhile passers-by come and take my flowers, one by one, and my basket is\r\nnearly empty.\r\n\r\nThe morning time is past, and the noon. In the shade of evening my eyes\r\nare drowsy with sleep. Men going home glance at me and smile and fill\r\nme with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face,\r\nand when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop my eyes and answer them\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOh, how, indeed, could I tell them that for thee I wait, and that thou\r\nhast promised to come. How could I utter for shame that I keep for my\r\ndowry this poverty. Ah, I hug this pride in the secret of my heart.\r\n\r\nI sit on the grass and gaze upon the sky and dream of the sudden\r\nsplendour of thy coming—all the lights ablaze, golden pennons flying\r\nover thy car, and they at the roadside standing agape, when they see\r\nthee come down from thy seat to raise me from the dust, and set at thy\r\nside this ragged beggar girl a-tremble with shame and pride, like a\r\ncreeper in a summer breeze.\r\n\r\nBut time glides on and still no sound of the wheels of thy chariot.\r\nMany a procession passes by with noise and shouts and glamour of glory.\r\nIs it only thou who wouldst stand in the shadow silent and behind them\r\nall? And only I who would wait and weep and wear out my heart in vain\r\nlonging?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, only\r\nthou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our\r\npilgrimage to no country and to no end.\r\n\r\nIn that shoreless ocean, at thy silently listening smile my songs would\r\nswell in melodies, free as waves, free from all bondage of words.\r\n\r\nIs the time not come yet? Are there works still to do? Lo, the evening\r\nhas come down upon the shore and in the fading light the seabirds come\r\nflying to their nests.\r\n\r\nWho knows when the chains will be off, and the boat, like the last\r\nglimmer of sunset, vanish into the night?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; and\r\nentering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown to\r\nme, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a\r\nfleeting moment of my life.\r\n\r\nAnd today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, I\r\nfind they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of joys\r\nand sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.\r\n\r\nThou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, and\r\nthe steps that I heard in my playroom are the same that are echoing\r\nfrom star to star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my delight, thus to wait and watch at the wayside where shadow\r\nchases light and the rain comes in the wake of the summer.\r\n\r\nMessengers, with tidings from unknown skies, greet me and speed along\r\nthe road. My heart is glad within, and the breath of the passing breeze\r\nis sweet.\r\n\r\nFrom dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, and I know that of a\r\nsudden the happy moment will arrive when I shall see.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. In the meanwhile the air\r\nis filling with the perfume of promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you not heard his silent steps? He comes, comes, ever comes.\r\n\r\nEvery moment and every age, every day and every night he comes, comes,\r\never comes.\r\n\r\nMany a song have I sung in many a mood of mind, but all their notes\r\nhave always proclaimed, “He comes, comes, ever comes.”\r\n\r\nIn the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes,\r\ncomes, ever comes.\r\n\r\nIn the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds\r\nhe comes, comes, ever comes.\r\n\r\nIn sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart, and it\r\nis the golden touch of his feet that makes my joy to shine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know not from what distant time thou art ever coming nearer to meet\r\nme. Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye.\r\n\r\nIn many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard and thy\r\nmessenger has come within my heart and called me in secret.\r\n\r\nI know not only why today my life is all astir, and a feeling of\r\ntremulous joy is passing through my heart.\r\n\r\nIt is as if the time were come to wind up my work, and I feel in the\r\nair a faint smell of thy sweet presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night is nearly spent waiting for him in vain. I fear lest in the\r\nmorning he suddenly come to my door when I have fallen asleep wearied\r\nout. Oh friends, leave the way open to him— forbid him not.\r\n\r\nIf the sounds of his steps does not wake me, do not try to rouse me, I\r\npray. I wish not to be called from my sleep by the clamorous choir of\r\nbirds, by the riot of wind at the festival of morning light. Let me\r\nsleep undisturbed even if my lord comes of a sudden to my door.\r\n\r\nAh, my sleep, precious sleep, which only waits for his touch to vanish.\r\nAh, my closed eyes that would open their lids only to the light of his\r\nsmile when he stands before me like a dream emerging from darkness of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nLet him appear before my sight as the first of all lights and all\r\nforms. The first thrill of joy to my awakened soul let it come from his\r\nglance. And let my return to myself be immediate return to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; and the\r\nflowers were all merry by the roadside; and the wealth of gold was\r\nscattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our\r\nway and paid no heed.\r\n\r\nWe sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for\r\nbarter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We\r\nquickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. Withered\r\nleaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. The shepherd boy\r\ndrowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, and I laid myself\r\ndown by the water and stretched my tired limbs on the grass.\r\n\r\nMy companions laughed at me in scorn; they held their heads high and\r\nhurried on; they never looked back nor rested; they vanished in the\r\ndistant blue haze. They crossed many meadows and hills, and passed\r\nthrough strange, far-away countries. All honour to you, heroic host of\r\nthe interminable path! Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, but\r\nfound no response in me. I gave myself up for lost in the depth of a\r\nglad humiliation—in the shadow of a dim delight.\r\n\r\nThe repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom slowly spread over my\r\nheart. I forgot for what I had travelled, and I surrendered my mind\r\nwithout struggle to the maze of shadows and songs.\r\n\r\nAt last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, I saw thee\r\nstanding by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. How I had feared that\r\nthe path was long and wearisome, and the struggle to reach thee was\r\nhard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou came down from your throne and stood at my cottage door.\r\n\r\nI was singing all alone in a corner, and the melody caught your ear.\r\nYou came down and stood at my cottage door.\r\n\r\nMasters are many in your hall, and songs are sung there at all hours.\r\nBut the simple carol of this novice struck at your love. One plaintive\r\nlittle strain mingled with the great music of the world, and with a\r\nflower for a prize you came down and stopped at my cottage door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had gone a-begging from door to door in the village path, when thy\r\ngolden chariot appeared in the distance like a gorgeous dream and I\r\nwondered who was this King of all kings!\r\n\r\nMy hopes rose high and methought my evil days were at an end, and I\r\nstood waiting for alms to be given unasked and for wealth scattered on\r\nall sides in the dust.\r\n\r\nThe chariot stopped where I stood. Thy glance fell on me and thou\r\ncamest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had come at\r\nlast. Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say “What\r\nhast thou to give to me?”\r\n\r\nAh, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! I\r\nwas confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I slowly took\r\nout the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee.\r\n\r\nBut how great my surprise when at the day’s end I emptied my bag on the\r\nfloor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap. I\r\nbitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night darkened. Our day’s works had been done. We thought that the\r\nlast guest had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were\r\nall shut. Only some said the king was to come. We laughed and said “No,\r\nit cannot be!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but\r\nthe wind. We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said,\r\n“It is the messenger!” We laughed and said “No, it must be the wind!”\r\n\r\nThere came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was\r\nthe distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled\r\nus in our sleep. Only some said it was the sound of wheels. We said in\r\na drowsy murmur, “No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!”\r\n\r\nThe night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came “Wake\r\nup! delay not!” We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with\r\nfear. Some said, “Lo, there is the king’s flag!” We stood up on our\r\nfeet and cried “There is no time for delay!”\r\n\r\nThe king has come—but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is the\r\nthrone to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the\r\ndecorations? Someone has said, “Vain is this cry! Greet him with empty\r\nhands, lead him into thy rooms all bare!”\r\n\r\nOpen the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! in the depth of the\r\nnight has come the king of our dark, dreary house. The thunder roars in\r\nthe sky. The darkness shudders with lightning. Bring out thy tattered\r\npiece of mat and spread it in the courtyard. With the storm has come of\r\na sudden our king of the fearful night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought I should ask of thee—but I dared not—the rose wreath thou\r\nhadst on thy neck. Thus I waited for the morning, when thou didst\r\ndepart, to find a few fragments on the bed. And like a beggar I\r\nsearched in the dawn only for a stray petal or two.\r\n\r\nAh me, what is it I find? What token left of thy love? It is no flower,\r\nno spices, no vase of perfumed water. It is thy mighty sword, flashing\r\nas a flame, heavy as a bolt of thunder. The young light of morning\r\ncomes through the window and spreads itself upon thy bed. The morning\r\nbird twitters and asks, “Woman, what hast thou got?” No, it is no\r\nflower, nor spices, nor vase of perfumed water—it is thy dreadful\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nI sit and muse in wonder, what gift is this of thine. I can find no\r\nplace to hide it. I am ashamed to wear it, frail as I am, and it hurts\r\nme when I press it to my bosom. Yet shall I bear in my heart this\r\nhonour of the burden of pain, this gift of thine.\r\n\r\nFrom now there shall be no fear left for me in this world, and thou\r\nshalt be victorious in all my strife. Thou hast left death for my\r\ncompanion and I shall crown him with my life. Thy sword is with me to\r\ncut asunder my bonds, and there shall be no fear left for me in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFrom now I leave off all petty decorations. Lord of my heart, no more\r\nshall there be for me waiting and weeping in corners, no more coyness\r\nand sweetness of demeanour. Thou hast given me thy sword for adornment.\r\nNo more doll’s decorations for me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeautiful is thy wristlet, decked with stars and cunningly wrought in\r\nmyriad-coloured jewels. But more beautiful to me thy sword with its\r\ncurve of lightning like the outspread wings of the divine bird of\r\nVishnu, perfectly poised in the angry red light of the sunset.\r\n\r\nIt quivers like the one last response of life in ecstasy of pain at the\r\nfinal stroke of death; it shines like the pure flame of being burning\r\nup earthly sense with one fierce flash.\r\n\r\nBeautiful is thy wristlet, decked with starry gems; but thy sword, O\r\nlord of thunder, is wrought with uttermost beauty, terrible to behold\r\nor think of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54.\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked nothing from thee; I uttered not my name to thine ear. When\r\nthou took’st thy leave I stood silent. I was alone by the well where\r\nthe shadow of the tree fell aslant, and the women had gone home with\r\ntheir brown earthen pitchers full to the brim. They called me and\r\nshouted, “Come with us, the morning is wearing on to noon.” But I\r\nlanguidly lingered awhile lost in the midst of vague musings.\r\n\r\nI heard not thy steps as thou camest. Thine eyes were sad when they\r\nfell on me; thy voice was tired as thou spokest low—“Ah, I am a thirsty\r\ntraveller.” I started up from my day-dreams and poured water from my\r\njar on thy joined palms. The leaves rustled overhead; the cuckoo sang\r\nfrom the unseen dark, and perfume of _babla_ flowers came from the bend\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\nI stood speechless with shame when my name thou didst ask. Indeed, what\r\nhad I done for thee to keep me in remembrance? But the memory that I\r\ncould give water to thee to allay thy thirst will cling to my heart and\r\nenfold it in sweetness. The morning hour is late, the bird sings in\r\nweary notes, _neem_ leaves rustle overhead and I sit and think and\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguor is upon your heart and the slumber is still on your eyes.\r\n\r\nHas not the word come to you that the flower is reigning in splendour\r\namong thorns? Wake, oh awaken! let not the time pass in vain!\r\n\r\nAt the end of the stony path, in the country of virgin solitude, my\r\nfriend is sitting all alone. Deceive him not. Wake, oh awaken!\r\n\r\nWhat if the sky pants and trembles with the heat of the midday sun—what\r\nif the burning sand spreads its mantle of thirst—\r\n\r\nIs there no joy in the deep of your heart? At every footfall of yours,\r\nwill not the harp of the road break out in sweet music of pain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it is that thy joy in me is so full. Thus it is that thou hast\r\ncome down to me. O thou lord of all heavens, where would be thy love if\r\nI were not?\r\n\r\nThou hast taken me as thy partner of all this wealth. In my heart is\r\nthe endless play of thy delight. In my life thy will is ever taking\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nAnd for this, thou who art the King of kings hast decked thyself in\r\nbeauty to captivate my heart. And for this thy love loses itself in the\r\nlove of thy lover, and there art thou seen in the perfect union of two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight, my light, the world-filling light, the eye-kissing light,\r\nheart-sweetening light!\r\n\r\nAh, the light dances, my darling, at the centre of my life; the light\r\nstrikes, my darling, the chords of my love; the sky opens, the wind\r\nruns wild, laughter passes over the earth.\r\n\r\nThe butterflies spread their sails on the sea of light. Lilies and\r\njasmines surge up on the crest of the waves of light.\r\n\r\nThe light is shattered into gold on every cloud, my darling, and it\r\nscatters gems in profusion.\r\n\r\nMirth spreads from leaf to leaf, my darling, and gladness without\r\nmeasure. The heaven’s river has drowned its banks and the flood of joy\r\nis abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet all the strains of joy mingle in my last song—the joy that makes\r\nthe earth flow over in the riotous excess of the grass, the joy that\r\nsets the twin brothers, life and death, dancing over the wide world,\r\nthe joy that sweeps in with the tempest, shaking and waking all life\r\nwith laughter, the joy that sits still with its tears on the open red\r\nlotus of pain, and the joy that throws everything it has upon the dust,\r\nand knows not a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, O beloved of my heart— this\r\ngolden light that dances upon the leaves, these idle clouds sailing\r\nacross the sky, this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nThe morning light has flooded my eyes—this is thy message to my heart.\r\nThy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, and my\r\nheart has touched thy feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky is\r\nmotionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the\r\nseashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.\r\n\r\nThey build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With\r\nwithered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the\r\nvast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds.\r\n\r\nThey know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl\r\nfishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children\r\ngather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden\r\ntreasures, they know not how to cast nets.\r\n\r\nThe sea surges up with laughter and pale gleams the smile of the sea\r\nbeach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children,\r\neven like a mother while rocking her baby’s cradle. The sea plays with\r\nchildren, and pale gleams the smile of the sea beach.\r\n\r\nOn the seashore of endless worlds children meet. Tempest roams in the\r\npathless sky, ships get wrecked in the trackless water, death is abroad\r\nand children play. On the seashore of endless worlds is the great\r\nmeeting of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sleep that flits on baby’s eyes—does anybody know from where it\r\ncomes? Yes, there is a rumour that it has its dwelling there, in the\r\nfairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with glow-worms,\r\nthere hang two timid buds of enchantment. From there it comes to kiss\r\nbaby’s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe smile that flickers on baby’s lips when he sleeps—does anybody know\r\nwhere it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young pale beam of a\r\ncrescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn cloud, and there\r\nthe smile was first born in the dream of a dew-washed morning—the smile\r\nthat flickers on baby’s lips when he sleeps.\r\n\r\nThe sweet, soft freshness that blooms on baby’s limbs—does anybody know\r\nwhere it was hidden so long? Yes, when the mother was a young girl it\r\nlay pervading her heart in tender and silent mystery of love—the sweet,\r\nsoft freshness that has bloomed on baby’s limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I bring to you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is\r\nsuch a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted\r\nin tints—when I give coloured toys to you, my child.\r\n\r\nWhen I sing to make you dance I truly now why there is music in leaves,\r\nand why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening\r\nearth—when I sing to make you dance.\r\n\r\nWhen I bring sweet things to your greedy hands I know why there is\r\nhoney in the cup of the flowers and why fruits are secretly filled with\r\nsweet juice—when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands.\r\n\r\nWhen I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely\r\nunderstand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and\r\nwhat delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my\r\nbody—when I kiss you to make you smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63.\r\n\r\n\r\nThou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou hast given me\r\nseats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought the distant near and made\r\na brother of the stranger.\r\n\r\nI am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I\r\nforget that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou\r\nabidest.\r\n\r\nThrough birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou\r\nleadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life\r\nwho ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nWhen one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut.\r\nOh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of\r\nthe one in the play of many.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the slope of the desolate river among tall grasses I asked her,\r\n“Maiden, where do you go shading your lamp with your mantle? My house\r\nis all dark and lonesome—lend me your light!” she raised her dark eyes\r\nfor a moment and looked at my face through the dusk. “I have come to\r\nthe river,” she said, “to float my lamp on the stream when the daylight\r\nwanes in the west.” I stood alone among tall grasses and watched the\r\ntimid flame of her lamp uselessly drifting in the tide.\r\n\r\nIn the silence of gathering night I asked her, “Maiden, your lights are\r\nall lit—then where do you go with your lamp? My house is all dark and\r\nlonesome—lend me your light.” She raised her dark eyes on my face and\r\nstood for a moment doubtful. “I have come,” she said at last, “to\r\ndedicate my lamp to the sky.” I stood and watched her light uselessly\r\nburning in the void.\r\n\r\nIn the moonless gloom of midnight I ask her, “Maiden, what is your\r\nquest, holding the lamp near your heart? My house is all dark and\r\nlonesome—lend me your light.” She stopped for a minute and thought and\r\ngazed at my face in the dark. “I have brought my light,” she said, “to\r\njoin the carnival of lamps.” I stood and watched her little lamp\r\nuselessly lost among lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat divine drink wouldst thou have, my God, from this overflowing cup\r\nof my life?\r\n\r\nMy poet, is it thy delight to see thy creation through my eyes and to\r\nstand at the portals of my ears silently to listen to thine own eternal\r\nharmony?\r\n\r\nThy world is weaving words in my mind and thy joy is adding music to\r\nthem. Thou givest thyself to me in love and then feelest thine own\r\nentire sweetness in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe who ever had remained in the depth of my being, in the twilight of\r\ngleams and of glimpses; she who never opened her veils in the morning\r\nlight, will be my last gift to thee, my God, folded in my final song.\r\n\r\nWords have wooed yet failed to win her; persuasion has stretched to her\r\nits eager arms in vain.\r\n\r\nI have roamed from country to country keeping her in the core of my\r\nheart, and around her have risen and fallen the growth and decay of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOver my thoughts and actions, my slumbers and dreams, she reigned yet\r\ndwelled alone and apart.\r\n\r\nMany a man knocked at my door and asked for her and turned away in\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nThere was none in the world who ever saw her face to face, and she\r\nremained in her loneliness waiting for thy recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67.\r\n\r\n\r\nThou art the sky and thou art the nest as well.\r\n\r\nO thou beautiful, there in the nest is thy love that encloses the soul\r\nwith colours and sounds and odours.\r\n\r\nThere comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand\r\nbearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds,\r\nthrough trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden\r\npitcher from the western ocean of rest.\r\n\r\nBut there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her\r\nflight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no day nor\r\nnight, nor form nor colour, and never, never a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n68.\r\n\r\n\r\nThy sunbeam comes upon this earth of mine with arms outstretched and\r\nstands at my door the livelong day to carry back to thy feet clouds\r\nmade of my tears and sighs and songs.\r\n\r\nWith fond delight thou wrappest about thy starry breast that mantle of\r\nmisty cloud, turning it into numberless shapes and folds and colouring\r\nit with hues everchanging.\r\n\r\nIt is so light and so fleeting, tender and tearful and dark, that is\r\nwhy thou lovest it, O thou spotless and serene. And that is why it may\r\ncover thy awful white light with its pathetic shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n69.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day runs\r\nthrough the world and dances in rhythmic measures.\r\n\r\nIt is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth in\r\nnumberless blades of grass and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves\r\nand flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth and of\r\ndeath, in ebb and in flow.\r\n\r\nI feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.\r\nAnd my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it beyond thee to be glad with the gladness of this rhythm? to be\r\ntossed and lost and broken in the whirl of this fearful joy?\r\n\r\nAll things rush on, they stop not, they look not behind, no power can\r\nhold them back, they rush on.\r\n\r\nKeeping steps with that restless, rapid music, seasons come dancing and\r\npass away—colours, tunes, and perfumes pour in endless cascades in the\r\nabounding joy that scatters and gives up and dies every moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n71.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, thus\r\ncasting coloured shadows on thy radiance—such is thy _maya_.\r\n\r\nThou settest a barrier in thine own being and then callest thy severed\r\nself in myriad notes. This thy self-separation has taken body in me.\r\n\r\nThe poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloured tears\r\nand smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, dreams\r\nbreak and form. In me is thy own defeat of self.\r\n\r\nThis screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures\r\nwith the brush of the night and the day. Behind it thy seat is woven in\r\nwondrous mysteries of curves, casting away all barren lines of\r\nstraightness.\r\n\r\nThe great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. With the tune\r\nof thee and me all the air is vibrant, and all ages pass with the\r\nhiding and seeking of thee and me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n72.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe it is, the innermost one, who awakens my being with his deep hidden\r\ntouches.\r\n\r\nHe it is who puts his enchantment upon these eyes and joyfully plays on\r\nthe chords of my heart in varied cadence of pleasure and pain.\r\n\r\nHe it is who weaves the web of this _maya_ in evanescent hues of gold\r\nand silver, blue and green, and lets peep out through the folds his\r\nfeet, at whose touch I forget myself.\r\n\r\nDays come and ages pass, and it is ever he who moves my heart in many a\r\nname, in many a guise, in many a rapture of joy and of sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeliverance is not for me in renunciation. I feel the embrace of\r\nfreedom in a thousand bonds of delight.\r\n\r\nThou ever pourest for me the fresh draught of thy wine of various\r\ncolours and fragrance, filling this earthen vessel to the brim.\r\n\r\nMy world will light its hundred different lamps with thy flame and\r\nplace them before the altar of thy temple.\r\n\r\nNo, I will never shut the doors of my senses. The delights of sight and\r\nhearing and touch will bear thy delight.\r\n\r\nYes, all my illusions will burn into illumination of joy, and all my\r\ndesires ripen into fruits of love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day is no more, the shadow is upon the earth. It is time that I go\r\nto the stream to fill my pitcher.\r\n\r\nThe evening air is eager with the sad music of the water. Ah, it calls\r\nme out into the dusk. In the lonely lane there is no passer-by, the\r\nwind is up, the ripples are rampant in the river.\r\n\r\nI know not if I shall come back home. I know not whom I shall chance to\r\nmeet. There at the fording in the little boat the unknown man plays\r\nupon his lute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75.\r\n\r\n\r\nThy gifts to us mortals fulfil all our needs and yet run back to thee\r\nundiminished.\r\n\r\nThe river has its everyday work to do and hastens through fields and\r\nhamlets; yet its incessant stream winds towards the washing of thy\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe flower sweetens the air with its perfume; yet its last service is\r\nto offer itself to thee.\r\n\r\nThy worship does not impoverish the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the words of the poet men take what meanings please them; yet\r\ntheir last meaning points to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay after day, O lord of my life, shall I stand before thee face to\r\nface. With folded hands, O lord of all worlds, shall I stand before\r\nthee face to face.\r\n\r\nUnder thy great sky in solitude and silence, with humble heart shall I\r\nstand before thee face to face.\r\n\r\nIn this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil and with\r\nstruggle, among hurrying crowds shall I stand before thee face to face.\r\n\r\nAnd when my work shall be done in this world, O King of kings, alone\r\nand speechless shall I stand before thee face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know thee as my God and stand apart—I do not know thee as my own and\r\ncome closer. I know thee as my father and bow before thy feet—I do not\r\ngrasp thy hand as my friend’s.\r\n\r\nI stand not where thou comest down and ownest thyself as mine, there to\r\nclasp thee to my heart and take thee as my comrade.\r\n\r\nThou art the Brother amongst my brothers, but I heed them not, I divide\r\nnot my earnings with them, thus sharing my all with thee.\r\n\r\nIn pleasure and in pain I stand not by the side of men, and thus stand\r\nby thee. I shrink to give up my life, and thus do not plunge into the\r\ngreat waters of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first\r\nsplendour, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang “Oh, the\r\npicture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!”\r\n\r\nBut one cried of a sudden—“It seems that somewhere there is a break in\r\nthe chain of light and one of the stars has been lost.”\r\n\r\nThe golden string of their harp snapped, their song stopped, and they\r\ncried in dismay—“Yes, that lost star was the best, she was the glory of\r\nall heavens!”\r\n\r\nFrom that day the search is unceasing for her, and the cry goes on from\r\none to the other that in her the world has lost its one joy!\r\n\r\nOnly in the deepest silence of night the stars smile and whisper among\r\nthemselves—“Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is not my portion to meet thee in this life then let me ever feel\r\nthat I have missed thy sight—let me not forget for a moment, let me\r\ncarry the pangs of this sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\r\n\r\nAs my days pass in the crowded market of this world and my hands grow\r\nfull with the daily profits, let me ever feel that I have gained\r\nnothing—let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of this\r\nsorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\r\n\r\nWhen I sit by the roadside, tired and panting, when I spread my bed low\r\nin the dust, let me ever feel that the long journey is still before\r\nme—let me not forget a moment, let me carry the pangs of this sorrow in\r\nmy dreams and in my wakeful hours.\r\n\r\nWhen my rooms have been decked out and the flutes sound and the\r\nlaughter there is loud, let me ever feel that I have not invited thee\r\nto my house—let me not forget for a moment, let me carry the pangs of\r\nthis sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am like a remnant of a cloud of autumn uselessly roaming in the sky,\r\nO my sun ever-glorious! Thy touch has not yet melted my vapour, making\r\nme one with thy light, and thus I count months and years separated from\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nIf this be thy wish and if this be thy play, then take this fleeting\r\nemptiness of mine, paint it with colours, gild it with gold, float it\r\non the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders.\r\n\r\nAnd again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, I shall\r\nmelt and vanish away in the dark, or it may be in a smile of the white\r\nmorning, in a coolness of purity transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn many an idle day have I grieved over lost time. But it is never\r\nlost, my lord. Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts,\r\nbuds into blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness.\r\n\r\nI was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had\r\nceased. In the morning I woke up and found my garden full with wonders\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nDays and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest\r\nhow to wait.\r\n\r\nThy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.\r\n\r\nWe have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a\r\nchances. We are too poor to be late.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man\r\nwho claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I\r\nfind that yet there is time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nThe stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but\r\nmine will hang upon thy breast.\r\n\r\nWealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to\r\nwithhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I\r\nbring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and\r\ngives birth to shapes innumerable in the infinite sky.\r\n\r\nIt is this sorrow of separation that gazes in silence all nights from\r\nstar to star and becomes lyric among rustling leaves in rainy darkness\r\nof July.\r\n\r\nIt is this overspreading pain that deepens into loves and desires, into\r\nsufferings and joy in human homes; and this it is that ever melts and\r\nflows in songs through my poet’s heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the warriors came out first from their master’s hall, where had\r\nthey hid their power? Where were their armour and their arms?\r\n\r\nThey looked poor and helpless, and the arrows were showered upon them\r\non the day they came out from their master’s hall.\r\n\r\nWhen the warriors marched back again to their master’s hall where did\r\nthey hide their power?\r\n\r\nThey had dropped the sword and dropped the bow and the arrow; peace was\r\non their foreheads, and they had left the fruits of their life behind\r\nthem on the day they marched back again to their master’s hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath, thy servant, is at my door. He has crossed the unknown sea and\r\nbrought thy call to my home.\r\n\r\nThe night is dark and my heart is fearful—yet I will take up the lamp,\r\nopen my gates and bow to him my welcome. It is thy messenger who stands\r\nat my door.\r\n\r\nI will worship him placing at his feet the treasure of my heart.\r\n\r\nHe will go back with his errand done, leaving a dark shadow on my\r\nmorning; and in my desolate home only my forlorn self will remain as my\r\nlast offering to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn desperate hope I go and search for her in all the corners of my\r\nroom; I find her not.\r\n\r\nMy house is small and what once has gone from it can never be regained.\r\n\r\nBut infinite is thy mansion, my lord, and seeking her I have to come to\r\nthy door.\r\n\r\nI stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky and I lift my\r\neager eyes to thy face.\r\n\r\nI have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish—no\r\nhope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears.\r\n\r\nOh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, plunge it into the deepest\r\nfullness. Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch in the allness of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeity of the ruined temple! The broken strings of _Vina_ sing no more\r\nyour praise. The bells in the evening proclaim not your time of\r\nworship. The air is still and silent about you.\r\n\r\nIn your desolate dwelling comes the vagrant spring breeze. It brings\r\nthe tidings of flowers—the flowers that for your worship are offered no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nYour worshipper of old wanders ever longing for favour still refused.\r\nIn the eventide, when fires and shadows mingle with the gloom of dust,\r\nhe wearily comes back to the ruined temple with hunger in his heart.\r\n\r\nMany a festival day comes to you in silence, deity of the ruined\r\ntemple. Many a night of worship goes away with lamp unlit.\r\n\r\nMany new images are built by masters of cunning art and carried to the\r\nholy stream of oblivion when their time is come.\r\n\r\nOnly the deity of the ruined temple remains unworshipped in deathless\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more noisy, loud words from me—such is my master’s will. Henceforth\r\nI deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in\r\nmurmurings of a song.\r\n\r\nMen hasten to the King’s market. All the buyers and sellers are there.\r\nBut I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nLet then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their\r\ntime; and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.\r\n\r\nFull many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil,\r\nbut now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my\r\nheart on to him; and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless\r\ninconsequence!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day when death will knock at thy door what wilt thou offer to\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nOh, I will set before my guest the full vessel of my life—I will never\r\nlet him go with empty hands.\r\n\r\nAll the sweet vintage of all my autumn days and summer nights, all the\r\nearnings and gleanings of my busy life will I place before him at the\r\nclose of my days when death will knock at my door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91.\r\n\r\n\r\nO thou the last fulfilment of life, Death, my death, come and whisper\r\nto me!\r\n\r\nDay after day I have kept watch for thee; for thee have I borne the\r\njoys and pangs of life.\r\n\r\nAll that I am, that I have, that I hope and all my love have ever\r\nflowed towards thee in depth of secrecy. One final glance from thine\r\neyes and my life will be ever thine own.\r\n\r\nThe flowers have been woven and the garland is ready for the\r\nbridegroom. After the wedding the bride shall leave her home and meet\r\nher lord alone in the solitude of night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that the day will come when my sight of this earth shall be\r\nlost, and life will take its leave in silence, drawing the last curtain\r\nover my eyes.\r\n\r\nYet stars will watch at night, and morning rise as before, and hours\r\nheave like sea waves casting up pleasures and pains.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of this end of my moments, the barrier of the moments\r\nbreaks and I see by the light of death thy world with its careless\r\ntreasures. Rare is its lowliest seat, rare is its meanest of lives.\r\n\r\nThings that I longed for in vain and things that I got—let them pass.\r\nLet me but truly possess the things that I ever spurned and overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all and\r\ntake my departure.\r\n\r\nHere I give back the keys of my door—and I give up all claims to my\r\nhouse. I only ask for last kind words from you.\r\n\r\nWe were neighbours for long, but I received more than I could give. Now\r\nthe day has dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. A\r\nsummons has come and I am ready for my journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time of my parting, wish me good luck, my friends! The sky is\r\nflushed with the dawn and my path lies beautiful.\r\n\r\nAsk not what I have with me to take there. I start on my journey with\r\nempty hands and expectant heart.\r\n\r\nI shall put on my wedding garland. Mine is not the red-brown dress of\r\nthe traveller, and though there are dangers on the way I have no fear\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\nThe evening star will come out when my voyage is done and the plaintive\r\nnotes of the twilight melodies be struck up from the King’s gateway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold of\r\nthis life.\r\n\r\nWhat was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a\r\nbud in the forest at midnight!\r\n\r\nWhen in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I\r\nwas no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and\r\nform had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother.\r\n\r\nEven so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And\r\nbecause I love this life, I know I shall love death as well.\r\n\r\nThe child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it\r\naway, in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I go from hence let this be my parting word, that what I have seen\r\nis unsurpassable.\r\n\r\nI have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus that expands on the\r\nocean of light, and thus am I blessed—let this be my parting word.\r\n\r\nIn this playhouse of infinite forms I have had my play and here have I\r\ncaught sight of him that is formless.\r\n\r\nMy whole body and my limbs have thrilled with his touch who is beyond\r\ntouch; and if the end comes here, let it come—let this be my parting\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n97.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my play was with thee I never questioned who thou wert. I knew nor\r\nshyness nor fear, my life was boisterous.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning thou wouldst call me from my sleep like my own\r\ncomrade and lead me running from glade to glade.\r\n\r\nOn those days I never cared to know the meaning of songs thou sangest\r\nto me. Only my voice took up the tunes, and my heart danced in their\r\ncadence.\r\n\r\nNow, when the playtime is over, what is this sudden sight that is come\r\nupon me? The world with eyes bent upon thy feet stands in awe with all\r\nits silent stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n98.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will deck thee with trophies, garlands of my defeat. It is never in\r\nmy power to escape unconquered.\r\n\r\nI surely know my pride will go to the wall, my life will burst its\r\nbonds in exceeding pain, and my empty heart will sob out in music like\r\na hollow reed, and the stone will melt in tears.\r\n\r\nI surely know the hundred petals of a lotus will not remain closed for\r\never and the secret recess of its honey will be bared.\r\n\r\nFrom the blue sky an eye shall gaze upon me and summon me in silence.\r\nNothing will be left for me, nothing whatever, and utter death shall I\r\nreceive at thy feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I give up the helm I know that the time has come for thee to take\r\nit. What there is to do will be instantly done. Vain is this struggle.\r\n\r\nThen take away your hands and silently put up with your defeat, my\r\nheart, and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still where you\r\nare placed.\r\n\r\nThese my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, and trying\r\nto light them I forget all else again and again.\r\n\r\nBut I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, spreading my mat on\r\nthe floor; and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, come silently and\r\ntake thy seat here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, hoping to gain the\r\nperfect pearl of the formless.\r\n\r\nNo more sailing from harbour to harbour with this my weather-beaten\r\nboat. The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am eager to die into the deathless.\r\n\r\nInto the audience hall by the fathomless abyss where swells up the\r\nmusic of toneless strings I shall take this harp of my life.\r\n\r\nI shall tune it to the notes of forever, and when it has sobbed out its\r\nlast utterance, lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver in my life have I sought thee with my songs. It was they who led\r\nme from door to door, and with them have I felt about me, searching and\r\ntouching my world.\r\n\r\nIt was my songs that taught me all the lessons I ever learnt; they\r\nshowed me secret paths, they brought before my sight many a star on the\r\nhorizon of my heart.\r\n\r\nThey guided me all the day long to the mysteries of the country of\r\npleasure and pain, and, at last, to what palace gate have they brought\r\nme in the evening at the end of my journey?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102.\r\n\r\n\r\nI boasted among men that I had known you. They see your pictures in all\r\nworks of mine. They come and ask me, “Who is he?” I know not how to\r\nanswer them. I say, “Indeed, I cannot tell.” They blame me and they go\r\naway in scorn. And you sit there smiling.\r\n\r\nI put my tales of you into lasting songs. The secret gushes out from my\r\nheart. They come and ask me, “Tell me all your meanings.” I know not\r\nhow to answer them. I say, “Ah, who knows what they mean!” They smile\r\nand go away in utter scorn. And you sit there smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one salutation to thee, my God, let all my senses spread out and\r\ntouch this world at thy feet.\r\n\r\nLike a rain-cloud of July hung low with its burden of unshed showers\r\nlet all my mind bend down at thy door in one salutation to thee.\r\n\r\nLet all my songs gather together their diverse strains into a single\r\ncurrent and flow to a sea of silence in one salutation to thee.\r\n\r\nLike a flock of homesick cranes flying night and day back to their\r\nmountain nests let all my life take its voyage to its eternal home in\r\none salutation to thee.",

What a state I am in!  Before he came, nothing mattered;\r\nI felt so free.  But now that he has come, goodness knows from\r\nwhere, my heart is filled with his dear self, and my home will be\r\nno home to me when he leaves.  Doctor, do you think he--\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  If there's life in his fate, then he will live long.\r\nBut what the medical scriptures say, it seems--\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Great heavens, what?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  The scriptures have it: \"Bile or palsey, cold or gout\r\nspring all alike.\"\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Oh, get along, don't fling your scriptures at me; you\r\nonly make me more anxious; tell me what I can do.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  [Taking snuff] The patient needs the most scrupulous\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  That's true; but tell me how.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  I have already mentioned, on no account must he be\r\nlet out of doors.\r\n\r\nMADHAV Poor child, it is very hard to keep him indoors all day\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  What else can you do?  The autumn sun and the damp\r\nare both very bad for the little fellow--for the scriptures have\r\nit:\r\n\r\n  \"In wheezing, swoon or in nervous fret,\r\n    In jaundice or leaden eyes--\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Never mind the scriptures, please.  Eh, then we must\r\nshut the poor thing up.  Is there no other method?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  None at all: for, \"In the wind and in the sun--\"\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What will your \"in this and in that\" do for me now?  Why\r\ndon't you let them alone and come straight to the point?  What's\r\nto be done then?  Your system is very, very hard for the poor\r\nboy; and he is so quiet too with all his pain and sickness.  It\r\ntears my heart to see him wince, as he takes your medicine.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  The more he winces, the surer is the effect.  That's\r\nwhy the sage Chyabana observes: \"In medicine as in good advices,\r\nthe least palatable ones are the truest.\"  Ah, well!  I must\r\nbe trotting now.  [Exit]\r\n\r\n[GAFFER enters]\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Well, I'm jiggered, there's Gaffer now.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Why, why, I won't bite you.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, but you are a devil to send children off their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  But you aren't a child, and you've no child in the\r\nhouse; why worry then?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Oh, but I have brought a child into the house.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Indeed, how so?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  You remember how my wife was dying to adopt a child?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Yes, but that's an old story; you didn't like the idea.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  You know, brother, how hard all this getting money in\r\nhas been.  That somebody else's child would sail in and waste all\r\nthis money earned with so much trouble--Oh, I hated the idea.\r\nBut this boy clings to my heart in such a queer sort of way--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  So that's the trouble!  and your money goes all for him\r\nand feels jolly lucky it does go at all.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Formerly, earning was a sort of passion with me; I\r\nsimply couldn't help working for money.  Now, I make money and as\r\nI know it is all for this dear boy, earning becomes a joy to me.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Ah, well, and where did you pick him up?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  He is the son of a man who was a brother to my wife by\r\nvillage ties.  He has had no mother since infancy; and now the\r\nother day he lost his father as well.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Poor thing: and so he needs me all the more.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  The doctor says all the organs of his little body are at\r\nloggerheads with each other, and there isn't much hope for his\r\nlife.  There is only one way to save him and that is to keep him\r\nout of this autumn wind and sun.  But you are such a terror!\r\nWhat with this game of yours at your age, too, to get children\r\nout of doors!\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  God bless my soul!  So I'm already as bad as autumn wind\r\nand sun, eh!  But, friend, I know something, too, of the game of\r\nkeeping them indoors.  When my day's work is over I am coming in\r\nto make friends with this child of yours.  [Exit]\r\n\r\n[AMAL enters]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Uncle, I say, Uncle!\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Hullo!  Is that you, Amal?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Mayn't I be out of the courtyard at all?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, my dear, no.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  See, there where Auntie grinds lentils in the quirn, the\r\nsquirrel is sitting with his tail up and with his wee hands he's\r\npicking up the broken grains of lentils and crunching them.\r\nCan't I run up there?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, my darling, no.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Wish I were a squirrel!--it would be lovely.  Uncle, why\r\nwon't you let me go about?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Doctor says it's bad for you to be out.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How can the doctor know?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What a thing to say!  The doctor can't know and he reads\r\nsuch huge books!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Does his book-learning tell him everything?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Of course, don't you know!\r\n\r\nAMAL [With a sigh] Ah, I am so stupid!  I don't read books.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Now, think of it; very, very learned people are all like\r\nyou; they are never out of doors.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Aren't they really?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, how can they?  Early and late they toil and moil at\r\ntheir books, and they've eyes for nothing else.  Now, my little\r\nman, you are going to be learned when you grow up; and then you\r\nwill stay at home and read such big books, and people will notice\r\nyou and say, \"he's a wonder.\"\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, no, Uncle; I beg of you by your dear feet--I don't\r\nwant to be learned, I won't.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Dear, dear; it would have been my saving if I could have\r\nbeen learned.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, I would rather go about and see everything that there\r\nis.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Listen to that!  See!  What will you see, what is there\r\nso much to see?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  See that far-away hill from our window--I often long to go\r\nbeyond those hills and right away.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Oh, you silly!  As if there's nothing more to be done\r\nbut just get up to the top of that hill and away!  Eh!  You don't\r\ntalk sense, my boy.  Now listen, since that hill stands there\r\nupright as a barrier, it means you can't get beyond it.  Else,\r\nwhat was the use in heaping up so many large stones to make such\r\na big affair of it, eh!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Uncle, do you think it is meant to prevent your crossing\r\nover?  It seems to me because the earth can't speak it raises its\r\nhands into the sky and beckons.  And those who live far and sit\r\nalone by their windows can see the signal.  But I suppose the\r\nlearned people--\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, they don't have time for that sort of nonsense.\r\nThey are not crazy like you.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Do you know, yesterday I met someone quite as crazy as I\r\nam.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Gracious me, really, how so?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  He had a bamboo staff on his shoulder with a small bundle\r\nat the top, and a brass pot in his left hand, and an old pair of\r\nshoes on; he was making for those hills straight across that\r\nmeadow there.  I called out to him and asked, \"Where are you\r\ngoing?\"  He answered, \"I don't know, anywhere!\"  I asked again,\r\n\"Why are you going?\"  He said, \"I'm going out to seek work.\"\r\nSay, Uncle, have you to seek work?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Of course I have to.  There's many about looking for\r\njobs.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How lovely!  I'll go about, like them too, finding things\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Suppose you seek and don't find.  Then--\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Wouldn't that be jolly?  Then I should go farther!  I\r\nwatched that man slowly walking on with his pair of worn out\r\nshoes.  And when he got to where the water flows under the fig\r\ntree, he stopped and washed his feet in the stream.  Then he took\r\nout from his bundle some gram-flour, moistened it with water and\r\nbegan to eat.  Then he tied up his bundle and shouldered it\r\nagain; tucked up his cloth above his knees and crossed the\r\nstream.  I've asked Auntie to let me go up to the stream, and eat\r\nmy gram-flour just like him.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  And what did your Auntie say to that?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Auntie said, \"Get well and then I'll take you over there.\"\r\nPlease, Uncle, when shall I get well?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  It won't be long, dear.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Really, but then I shall go right away the moment I'm well\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  And where will you go?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, I will walk on, crossing so many streams, wading\r\nthrough water.  Everybody will be asleep with their doors shut in\r\nthe heat of the day and I will tramp on and on seeking work far,\r\nvery far.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  I see!  I think you had better be getting well first;\r\nthen--\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But then you won't want me to be learned, will you, Uncle?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What would you rather be then?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I can't think of anything just now; but I'll tell you\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Very well.  But mind you, you aren't to call out and\r\ntalk to strangers again.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But I love to talk to strangers!\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Suppose they had kidnapped you?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  That would have been splendid!  But no one ever takes me\r\naway.  They all want me to stay in here.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  I am off to my work--but, darling, you won't go out,\r\nwill you?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, I won't.  But, Uncle, you'll let me be in this room by\r\nthe roadside.\r\n\r\n[Exit MADHAV]\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Curds, curds, good nice curds.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Curdseller, I say, Curdseller.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Why do you call me?  Will you buy some curds?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How can I buy?  I have no money.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  What a boy!  Why call out then?  Ugh!  What a waste of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I would go with you if I could.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  With me?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Yes, I seem to feel homesick when I hear you call from far\r\ndown the road.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  [Lowering his yoke-pole] Whatever are you doing here, my\r\nchild?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  The doctor says I'm not to be out, so I sit here all day\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  My poor child, whatever has happened to you?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I can't tell.  You see I am not learned, so I don't know\r\nwhat's the matter with me.  Say, Dairyman, where do you come\r\nfrom?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  From our village.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Your village?  Is it very far?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Our village lies on the river Shamli at the foot of\r\nthe Panch-mura hills.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Panch-mura hills!  Shamli river!  I wonder.  I may have\r\nseen your village.  I can't think when though!\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Have you seen it?  Been to the foot of those hills?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Never.  But I seem to remember having seen it.  Your\r\nvillage is under some very old big trees, just by the side of the\r\nred road--isn't that so?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  That's right, child.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And on the slope of the hill cattle grazing.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  How wonderful!  Aren't there cattle grazing in our\r\nvillage!  Indeed, there are!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And your women with red sarees fill their pitchers from\r\nthe river and carry them on their heads.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Good, that's right.  Women from our dairy village do\r\ncome and draw their water from the river; but then it isn't\r\neveryone who has a red saree to put on.  But, my dear child,\r\nsurely you must have been there for a walk some time.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Really, Dairyman, never been there at all.  But the first\r\nday doctor lets me go out, you are going to take me to your\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  I will, my child, with pleasure.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And you'll teach me to cry curds and shoulder the yoke\r\nlike you and walk the long, long road?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Dear, dear, did you ever?  Why should you sell curds?\r\nNo, you will read big books and be learned.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, I never want to be learned--I'll be like you and take\r\nmy curds from the village by the red road near the old banyan\r\ntree, and I will hawk it from cottage to cottage.  Oh, how do you\r\ncry--\"Curd, curd, good nice curd!\"  Teach me the tune, will you?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Dear, dear, teach you the tune; what an idea!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Please do.  I love to hear it.  I can't tell you how queer\r\nI feel when I hear you cry out from the bend of that road,\r\nthrough the line of those trees!  Do you know I feel like that\r\nwhen I hear the shrill cry of kites from almost the end of the\r\nsky?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Dear child, will you have some curds?  Yes, do.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But I have no money.\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  No, no, no, don't talk of money!  You'll make me so\r\nhappy if you have a little curds from me.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, have I kept you too long?\r\n\r\nDAIRYMAN.  Not a bit; it has been no loss to me at all; you have\r\ntaught me how to be happy selling curds.  [Exit]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  [Intoning] Curds, curds, good nice curds--from the dairy\r\nvillage--from the country of the Panch-mura hills by the Shamli\r\nbank.  Curds, good curds; in the early morning the women make the\r\ncows stand in a row under the trees and milk them, and in the\r\nevening they turn the milk into curds.  Curds, good curds.\r\nHello, there's the watchman on his rounds.  Watchman, I say, come\r\nand have a word with me.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  What's all this row you are making?  Aren't you afraid\r\nof the likes of me?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, why should I be?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Suppose I march you off then?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Where will you take me to?  Is it very far, right beyond\r\nthe hills?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Suppose I march you straight to the King?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  To the King!  Do, will you?  But the doctor won't let me\r\ngo out.  No one can ever take me away.  I've got to stay here all\r\nday long.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Doctor won't let you, poor fellow!  So I see!  Your\r\nface is pale and there are dark rings round your eyes.  Your\r\nveins stick out from your poor thin hands.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Won't you sound the gong, Watchman?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Time has not yet come.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How curious!  Some say time has not yet come, and some say\r\ntime has gone by!  But surely your time will come the moment you\r\nstrike the gong!\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  That's not possible; I strike up the gong only when it\r\nis time.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Yes, I love to hear your gong.  When it is midday and our\r\nmeal is over, Uncle goes off to his work and Auntie falls asleep\r\nreading her Râmayana, and in the courtyard under the shadow of\r\nthe wall our doggie sleeps with his nose in his curled up tail;\r\nthen your gong strikes out, \"Dong, dong, dong!\"  Tell me why does\r\nyour gong sound?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  My gong sounds to tell the people, Time waits for\r\nnone, but goes on forever.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Where, to what land?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  That none knows.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Then I suppose no one has ever been there!  Oh, I do wish\r\nto fly with the time to that land of which no one knows anything.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  All of us have to get there one day, my child.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Have I too?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Yes, you too!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But doctor won't let me out.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  One day the doctor himself may take you there by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  He won't; you don't know him.  He only keeps me in.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  One greater than he comes and lets us free.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  When will this great doctor come for me?  I can't stick in\r\nhere any more.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Shouldn't talk like that, my child.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No.  I am here where they have left me--I never move a\r\nbit.  But when your gong goes off, dong, dong, dong, it goes to\r\nmy heart.  Say, Watchman?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Yes, my dear.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, what's going on there in that big house on the other\r\nside, where there is a flag flying high up and the people are\r\nalways going in and out?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Oh, there?  That's our new Post Office.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Post Office?  Whose?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Whose?  Why, the King's surely!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Do letters come from the King to his office here?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Of course.  One fine day there may be a letter for you\r\nin there.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  A letter for me?  But I am only a little boy.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  The King sends tiny notes to little boys.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, how lovely!  When shall I have my letter?  How do you\r\nguess he'll write to me?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Otherwise why should he set his Post Office here right\r\nin front of your open window, with the golden flag flying?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But who will fetch me my King's letter when it comes?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  The King has many postmen.  Don't you see them run\r\nabout with round gilt badges on their chests?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Well, where do they go?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Oh, from door to door, all through the country.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I'll be the King's postman when I grow up.\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Ha!  ha!  Postman, indeed!  Rain or shine, rich or\r\npoor, from house to house delivering letters--that's very great\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  That's what I'd like best.  What makes you smile so?  Oh,\r\nyes, your work is great too.  When it is silent everywhere in the\r\nheat of the noonday, your gong sounds, Dong, dong, dong,--and\r\nsometimes when I wake up at night all of a sudden and find our\r\nlamp blown out, I can hear through the darkness your gong slowly\r\nsounding, Dong, dong, dong!\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  There's the village headman!  I must be off.  If he\r\ncatches me gossiping with you there'll be a great to do.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  The headman?  Whereabouts is he?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Right down the road there; see that huge palm-leaf\r\numbrella hopping along?  That's him!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I suppose the King's made him our headman here?\r\n\r\nWATCHMAN.  Made him?  Oh, no!  A fussy busy-body!  He knows so\r\nmany ways of making himself unpleasant that everybody is afraid\r\nof him.  It's just a game for the likes of him, making trouble\r\nfor everybody.  I must be off now!  Mustn't keep work waiting,\r\nyou know!  I'll drop in again to-morrow morning and tell you all\r\nthe news of the town.  [Exit]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  It would be splendid to have a letter from the King every\r\nday.  I'll read them at the window.  But, oh!  I can't read\r\nwriting.  Who'll read them out to me, I wonder!  Auntie reads her\r\nRâmayana; she may know the King's writing.  If no one will, then\r\nI must keep them carefully and read them when I'm grown up.  But\r\nif the postman can't find me?  Headman, Mr. Headman, may I have a\r\nword with you?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Who is yelling after me on the highway?  Oh, you\r\nwretched monkey!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  You're the headman.  Everybody minds you.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN [Looking pleased] Yes, oh yes, they do!  They must!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Do the King's postmen listen to you?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  They've got to.  By Jove, I'd like to see--\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Will you tell the postman it's Amal who sits by the window\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  What's the good of that?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  In case there's a letter for me.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  A letter for you!  Whoever's going to write to you?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  If the King does.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Ha!  ha!  What an uncommon little fellow you are!  Ha!\r\nha!  the King indeed, aren't you his bosom friend, eh!  You\r\nhaven't met for a long while and the King is pining, I am sure.\r\nWait till to-morrow and you'll have your letter.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, Headman, why do you speak to me in that tone of\r\nvoice?  Are you cross?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Upon my word!  Cross, indeed!  You write to the King!\r\nMadhav is devilish swell nowadays.  He'd made a little pile; and\r\nso kings and padishahs are everyday talk with his people.  Let me\r\nfind him once and I'll make him dance.  Oh, you snipper-snapper!\r\nI'll get the King's letter sent to your house--indeed I will!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, no, please don't trouble yourself about it.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  And why not, pray!  I'll tell the King about you and he\r\nwon't be very long.  One of his footmen will come along presently\r\nfor news of you.  Madhav's impudence staggers me.  If the King\r\nhears of this, that'll take some of his nonsense out of him.\r\n[Exit]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Who are you walking there?  How your anklets tinkle!  Do\r\nstop a while, dear, won't you?\r\n\r\n[A GIRL enters]\r\n\r\nGIRL.  I haven't a moment to spare; it is already late!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I see, you don't wish to stop; I don't care to stay on\r\nhere either.\r\n\r\nGIRL.  You make me think of some late star of the morning!\r\nWhatever's the matter with you?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I don't know; the doctor won't let me out.\r\n\r\nGIRL.  Ah me!  Don't then!  Should listen to the doctor.\r\nPeople'll be cross with you if you're naughty.  I know, always\r\nlooking out and watching must make you feel tired.  Let me close\r\nthe window a bit for you.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, don't, only this one's open!  All the others are shut.\r\nBut will you tell me who you are?  Don't seem to know you.\r\n\r\nGIRL.  I am Sudha.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  What Sudha?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Don't you know?  Daughter of the flower-seller here.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  What do you do?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  I gather flowers in my basket.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, flower gathering!  That is why your feet seem so glad\r\nand your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk.  Wish I could be\r\nout too.  Then I would pick some flowers for you from the very\r\ntopmost branches right out of sight.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Would you really?  Do you know more about flowers than I?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Yes, I do, quite as much.  I know all about Champa of the\r\nfairy tale and his seven brothers.  If only they let me, I'll go\r\nright into the dense forest where you can't find your way.  And\r\nwhere the honey-sipping hummingbird rocks himself on the end of\r\nthe thinnest branch, I will flower out as a champa.  Would you be\r\nmy sister Parul?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  You are silly!  How can I be sister Parul when I am Sudha\r\nand my mother is Sasi, the flower-seller?  I have to weave so\r\nmany garlands a day.  It would be jolly if I could lounge here\r\nlike you!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  What would you do then, all the day long?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  I could have great times with my doll Benay the bride,\r\nand Meni the pussycat and--but I say it is getting late and I\r\nmustn't stop, or I won't find a single flower.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, wait a little longer; I do like it so!\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Ah, well--now don't you be naughty.  Be good and sit\r\nstill and on my way back home with the flowers I'll come and talk\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And you'll let me have a flower then?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  No, how can I?  It has to be paid for.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I'll pay when I grow up--before I leave to look for work\r\nout on the other side of that stream there.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Very well, then.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And you'll come back when you have your flowers?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  I will.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  You will, really?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Yes, I will.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  You won't forget me?  I am Amal, remember that.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  I won't forget you, you'll see.  [Exit]\r\n\r\n[A TROOP OF BOYS enter]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, brothers, where are you all off to?  Stop here a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  We're off to play.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  What will you play at, brothers?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  We'll play at being ploughmen.\r\n\r\nFIRST BOY [Showing a stick] This is our ploughshare.\r\n\r\nSECOND BOY.  We two are the pair of oxen.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And you're going to play the whole day?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Yes, all day long.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And you'll come back home in the evening by the road along\r\nthe river bank?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Yes.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Do you pass our house on your way home?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  You come out to play with us, yes do.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Doctor won't let me out.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Doctor!  Suppose the likes of you mind the doctor.  Let's\r\nbe off; it is getting late.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Don't.  Why not play on the road near this window?  I\r\ncould watch you then.\r\n\r\nTHIRD BOY.  What can we play at here?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  With all these toys of mine lying about.  Here you are,\r\nhave them.  I can't play alone.  They are getting dirty and are\r\nof no use to me.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  How jolly!  What fine toys!  Look, here's a ship.  There's\r\nold mother Jatai; say, chaps, ain't he a gorgeous sepoy?  And\r\nyou'll let us have them all?  You don't really mind?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, not a bit; have them by all means.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  You don't want them back?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, no, I shan't want them.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Say, won't you get a scolding for this?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No one will scold me.  But will you play with them in\r\nfront of our door for a while every morning?  I'll get you new\r\nones when these are old.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Oh, yes, we will.  Say, chaps, put these sepoys into a\r\nline.  We'll play at war; where can we get a musket?  Oh, look\r\nhere, this bit of reed will do nicely.  Say, but you're off to\r\nsleep already.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I'm afraid I'm sleepy.  I don't know, I feel like it at\r\ntimes.  I have been sitting a long while and I'm tired; my back\r\naches.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  It's only early noon now.  How is it you're sleepy?  Listen!\r\nThe gong's sounding the first watch.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Yes, dong, dong, dong, it tolls me to sleep.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  We had better go then.  We'll come in again to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I want to ask you something before you go.  You are always\r\nout--do you know of the King's postmen?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Yes, quite well.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Who are they?  Tell me their names.\r\n\r\nBOYS.  One's Badal, another's Sarat.  There's so many of them.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Do you think they will know me if there's a letter for me?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Surely, if your name's on the letter they will find you out.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  When you call in to-morrow morning, will you bring one of\r\nthem along so that he'll know me?\r\n\r\nBOYS.  Yes, if you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POST OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II\r\n\r\n\r\n[AMAL in Bed]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Can't I go near the window to-day, Uncle?  Would the\r\ndoctor mind that too?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Yes, darling, you see you've made yourself worse\r\nsquatting there day after day.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Oh, no, I don't know if it's made me more ill, but I\r\nalways feel well when I'm there.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, you don't; you squat there and make friends with the\r\nwhole lot of people round here, old and young, as if they are\r\nholding a fair right under my eaves--flesh and blood won't stand\r\nthat strain.  Just see--your face is quite pale.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Uncle, I fear my fakir'll pass and not see me by the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Your fakir, whoever's that?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  He comes and chats to me of the many lands where he's\r\nbeen.  I love to hear him.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  How's that?  I don't know of any fakirs.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  This is about the time he comes in.  I beg of you, by your\r\ndear feet, ask him in for a moment to talk to me here.\r\n\r\n[GAFFER Enters in a FAKIR'S Guise]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  There you are.  Come here, Fakir, by my bedside.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Upon my word, but this is--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  [Winking hard] I am the fakir.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  It beats my reckoning what you're not.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Where have you been this time, Fakir?\r\n\r\nFAKIR.  To the Isle of Parrots.  I am just back.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  The Parrots' Isle!\r\n\r\nFAKIR.  Is it so very astonishing?  Am I like you, man?  A\r\njourney doesn't cost a thing.  I tramp just where I like.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  [Clapping] How jolly for you!  Remember your promise to take\r\nme with you as your follower when I'm well.\r\n\r\nFAKIR.  Of course, and I'll teach you such secrets too of\r\ntravelling that nothing in sea or forest or mountain can bar your\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What's all this rigmarole?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Amal, my dear, I bow to nothing in sea or mountain; but\r\nif the doctor joins in with this uncle of yours, then I with all\r\nmy magic must own myself beaten.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No.  Uncle shan't tell the doctor.  And I promise to lie\r\nquiet; but the day I am well, off I go with the Fakir and nothing\r\nin sea or mountain or torrent shall stand in my way.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Fie, dear child, don't keep on harping upon going!  It\r\nmakes me so sad to hear you talk so.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Tell me, Fakir, what the Parrots' Isle is like.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  It's a land of wonders; it's a haunt of birds.  There's\r\nno man; and they neither speak nor walk, they simply sing and\r\nthey fly.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How glorious!  And it's by some sea?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Of course.  It's on the sea.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And green hills are there?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Indeed, they live among the green hills; and in the time\r\nof the sunset when there is a red glow on the hillside, all the\r\nbirds with their green wings flock back to their nests.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  And there are waterfalls!\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Dear me, of course; you don't have a hill without its\r\nwaterfalls.  Oh, it's like molten diamonds; and, my dear, what\r\ndances they have!  Don't they make the pebbles sing as they rush\r\nover them to the sea.  No devil of a doctor can stop them for a\r\nmoment.  The birds looked upon me as nothing but a man, quite a\r\ntrifling creature without wings--and they would have nothing to\r\ndo with me.  Were it not so I would build a small cabin for\r\nmyself among their crowd of nests and pass my days counting the\r\nsea waves.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How I wish I were a bird!  Then--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  But that would have been a bit of a job; I hear you've\r\nfixed up with the dairyman to be a hawker of curds when you grow\r\nup; I'm afraid such business won't flourish among birds; you\r\nmight land yourself into serious loss.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Really this is too much.  Between you two I shall turn\r\ncrazy.  Now, I'm off.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Has the dairyman been, Uncle?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  And why shouldn't he?  He won't bother his head running\r\nerrands for your pet fakir, in and out among the nests in his\r\nParrots' Isle.  But he has left a jar of curd for you saying that\r\nhe is rather busy with his niece's wedding in the village, and he\r\nhas got to order a band at Kamlipara.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  But he is going to marry me to his little niece.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Dear me, we are in a fix now.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  He said she would find me a lovely little bride with a\r\npair of pearl drops in her ears and dressed in a lovely red\r\nsâree; and in the morning she would milk with her own hands the\r\nblack cow and feed me with warm milk with foam on it from a brand\r\nnew earthen cruse; and in the evenings she would carry the lamp\r\nround the cow-house, and then come and sit by me to tell me tales\r\nof Champa and his six brothers.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: In act 1, Amal mentions to Sudha about Champa\r\nand his seven brothers. In this act, Amal mentions to Gaffer about\r\nChampa and his six brothers. Translator error?]\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  How delicious!  The prospect tempts even me, a hermit!\r\nBut never mind, dear, about this wedding.  Let it be.  I tell you\r\nwhen you wed there'll be no lack of nieces in his household.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Shut up!  This is more than I can stand.  [Exit]\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Fakir, now that Uncle's off, just tell me, has the King\r\nsent me a letter to the Post Office?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  I gather that his letter has already started; but it's\r\nstill on the way.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  On the way?  Where is it?  Is it on that road winding\r\nthrough the trees which you can follow to the end of the forest\r\nwhen the sky is quite clear after rain?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  That's so.  You know all about it already.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I do, everything.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  So I see, but how?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I can't say; but it's quite clear to me.  I fancy I've\r\nseen it often in days long gone by.  How long ago I can't tell.\r\nDo you know when?  I can see it all: there, the King's postman\r\ncoming down the hillside alone, a lantern in his left hand and on\r\nhis back a bag of letters climbing down for ever so long, for\r\ndays and nights, and where at the foot of the mountain the\r\nwaterfall becomes a stream he takes to the footpath on the bank\r\nand walks on through the rye; then comes the sugarcane field and\r\nhe disappears into the narrow lane cutting through the tall stems\r\nof sugarcanes; then he reaches the open meadow where the cricket\r\nchirps and where there is not a single man to be seen, only the\r\nsnipe wagging their tails and poking at the mud with their bills.\r\nI can feel him coming nearer and nearer and my heart becomes\r\nglad.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  My eyes aren't young; but you make me see all the same.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, Fakir, do you know the King who has this Post Office?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  I do; I go to him for my alms every day.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Good!  When I get well, I must have my alms too from him,\r\nmayn't I?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  You won't need to ask, my dear, he'll give it to you of\r\nhis own accord.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, I would go to his gate and cry, \"Victory to thee,\r\nO King!\"  and dancing to the tabor's sound, ask for alms.\r\nWon't it be nice?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  It would be splendid, and if you're with me, I shall\r\nhave my full share.  But what'll you ask?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I shall say, \"Make me your postman, that I may go about\r\nlantern in hand, delivering your letters from door to door.\r\nDon't let me stay at home all day!\"\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  What is there to be sad for, my child, even were you to\r\nstay at home?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  It isn't sad.  When they shut me in here first I felt the\r\nday was so long.  Since the King's Post Office I like it more and\r\nmore being indoors, and as I think I shall get a letter one day,\r\nI feel quite happy and then I don't mind being quiet and alone.\r\nI wonder if I shall make out what'll be in the King's letter?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Even if you didn't wouldn't it be enough if it just bore\r\nyour name?\r\n\r\n[MADHAV enters]\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Have you any idea of the trouble you've got me into,\r\nbetween you two?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  What's the matter?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  I hear you've let it get rumored about that the King has\r\nplanted his office here to send messages to both of you.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Well, what about it?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Our headman Panchanan has had it told to the King\r\nanonymously.\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Aren't we aware that everything reaches the King's ears?\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Then why don't you look out?  Why take the King's name\r\nin vain?  You'll bring me to ruin if you do.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, Fakir, will the King be cross?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Cross, nonsense!  And with a child like you and a fakir\r\nsuch as I am.  Let's see if the King be angry, and then won't I\r\ngive him a piece of my mind.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Say, Fakir, I've been feeling a sort of darkness coming\r\nover my eyes since the morning.  Everything seems like a dream.\r\nI long to be quiet.  I don't feel like talking at all.  Won't the\r\nKing's letter come?  Suppose this room melts away all on a\r\nsudden, suppose--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  [Fanning AMAL] The letter's sure to come to-day, my boy.\r\n\r\n[DOCTOR enters]\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.  And how do you feel to-day?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Feel awfully well to-day, Doctor.  All pain seems to have\r\nleft me.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.  [Aside to MADHAV] Don't quite like the look of that smile.\r\nBad sign that, his feeling well!  Chakradhan has observed--\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  For goodness sake, Doctor, leave Chakradhan alone.  Tell\r\nme what's going to happen?\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.  Can't hold him in much longer, I fear!  I warned you\r\nbefore--This looks like a fresh exposure.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  No, I've used the utmost care, never let him out of\r\ndoors; and the windows have been shut almost all the time.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.  There's a peculiar quality in the air to-day.  As I came\r\nin I found a fearful draught through your front door.  That's\r\nmost hurtful.  Better lock it at once.  Would it matter if this\r\nkept your visitors off for two or three days?  If someone happens\r\nto call unexpectedly--there's the back door.  You had better shut\r\nthis window as well, it's letting in the sunset rays only to keep\r\nthe patient awake.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Amal has shut his eyes.  I expect he is sleeping.  His\r\nface tells me--Oh, Doctor, I bring in a child who is a stranger\r\nand love him as my own, and now I suppose I must lose him!\r\n\r\nDOCTOR.  What's that?  There's your headman sailing in!--What a\r\nbother!  I must be going, brother.  You had better stir about and\r\nsee to the doors being properly fastened.  I will send on a\r\nstrong dose directly I get home.  Try it on him--it may save him\r\nat last, if he can be saved at all.  [Exeunt MADHAV and DOCTOR.]\r\n\r\n[The HEADMAN enters]\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Hello, urchin!\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  [Rising hastily] 'Sh, be quiet.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, Fakir, did you think I was asleep?  I wasn't.  I can\r\nhear everything; yes, and voices far away.  I feel that mother\r\nand father are sitting by my pillow and speaking to me.\r\n\r\n[MADHAV enters]\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  I say, Madhav, I hear you hobnob with bigwigs nowadays.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Spare me your jests, Headman, we are but common people.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  But your child here is expecting a letter from the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Don't you take any notice of him, a mere foolish boy!\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Indeed, why not!  It'll beat the King hard to find a\r\nbetter family!  Don't you see why the King plants his new Post\r\nOffice right before your window?  Why there's a letter for you\r\nfrom the King, urchin.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  [Starting up] Indeed, really!\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  How can it be false?  You're the King's chum.  Here's\r\nyour letter [showing a blank slip of paper].  Ha, ha, ha!  This\r\nis the letter.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Please don't mock me.  Say, Fakir, is it so?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Yes, my dear.  I as Fakir tell you it is his letter.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  How is it I can't see?  It all looks so blank to me.  What\r\nis there in the letter, Mr. Headman?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  The King says, \"I am calling on you shortly; you had\r\nbetter arrange puffed rice offerings for me.--Palace fare is\r\nquite tasteless to me now.\"  Ha!  ha!  ha!\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  [With folded palms] I beseech you, headman, don't you joke\r\nabout these things--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Cutting jokes indeed, dare he!\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  Are you out of your mind too, Gaffer?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Out of my mind, well then I am; I can read plainly that\r\nthe King writes he will come himself to see Amal, with the state\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Fakir, Fakir, 'sh, his trumpet!  Can't you hear?\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Ha!  ha!  ha!  I fear he won't until he's a bit more\r\noff his head.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Mr. Headman, I thought you were cross with me and didn't\r\nlove me.  I never could think you would fetch me the King's\r\nletter.  Let me wipe the dust off your feet.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  This little child does have an instinct of reverence.\r\nThough a little silly, he has a good heart.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  It's hard on the fourth watch now, I suppose--Hark the\r\ngong, \"Dong, dong, ding,\" \"Dong, dong, ding.\"  Is the evening\r\nstar up?  How is it I can't see--\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Oh, the windows are all shut, I'll open them.\r\n\r\n[A knocking outside]\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What's that?--Who is it--what a bother!\r\n\r\nVOICE.  [From outside] Open the door.\r\n\r\nMADHAV Say, Headman--Hope they're not robbers.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  Who's there?--It's Panchanan, the headman, calls--Aren't\r\nyou afraid of the like of me?  Fancy!  The noise has ceased!\r\nPanchanan's voice carries far.--Yes, show me the biggest robbers!\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  [Peering out of the window] I should think the noise has\r\nceased.  They've smashed the door.\r\n\r\n[THE KING'S HERALD enters]\r\n\r\nHERALD.  Our Sovereign King comes to-night!\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  My God!\r\n\r\nAMAL.  At what hour of the night, Herald?\r\n\r\nHERALD.  On the second watch.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  When from the city gates my friend the watchman will\r\nstrike his gong, \"ding dong ding, ding dong ding\"--then?\r\n\r\nHERALD.  Yes, then.  The King sends his greatest physician to\r\nattend on his young friend.\r\n\r\n[STATE   Physician enters]\r\n\r\nSTATE PHYSICIAN.  What's this?  How close it is here!  Open wide\r\nall the doors and windows.  [Feeling AMAL'S body] How do you\r\nfeel, my child?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I feel very well, Doctor, very well.  All pain is gone.\r\nHow fresh and open!  I can see all the stars now twinkling from\r\nthe other side of the dark.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  Will you feel well enough to leave your bed with the\r\nKing when he comes in the middle watches of the night?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Of course, I'm dying to be about for ever so long.  I'll\r\nask the King to find me the polar star.--I must have seen it\r\noften, but I don't know exactly which it is.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  He will tell you everything.  [To MADHAV] Will you go\r\nabout and arrange flowers through the room for the King's visit?\r\n[Indicating the HEADMAN] We can't have that person in here.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  No, let him be, Doctor.  He is a friend.  It was he who\r\nbrought me the King's letter.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  Very well, my child.  He may remain if he is a friend\r\nof yours.\r\n\r\nMADHAV [Whispering into AMAL'S ear] My child, the King loves you.\r\nHe is coming himself.  Beg for a gift from him.  You know our\r\nhumble circumstances.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Don't you worry, Uncle.--I've made up my mind about it.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  What is it, my child?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  I shall ask him to make me one of his postmen that I may\r\nwander far and wide, delivering his message from door to door.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  [Slapping his forehead] Alas, is that all?\r\n\r\nAMAL.  What'll be our offerings to the King, Uncle, when he\r\ncomes?\r\n\r\nHERALD.  He has commanded puffed rice.\r\n\r\nAMAL.  Puffed rice!  Say, Headman, you're right.  You said so.\r\nYou knew all we didn't.\r\n\r\nHEADMAN.  If you send word to my house then I could manage for\r\nthe King's advent really nice--\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  No need at all.  Now be quiet all of you.  Sleep is\r\ncoming over him.  I'll sit by his pillow; he's dropping into\r\nslumber.  Blow out the oil-lamp.  Only let the star-light stream\r\nin.  Hush, he slumbers.\r\n\r\nMADHAV.  [Addressing GAFFER] What are you standing there for like\r\na statue, folding your palms.--I am nervous.--Say, are they good\r\nomens?  Why are they darkening the room?  How will star-light\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\nGAFFER.  Silence, unbeliever.\r\n\r\n[SUDHA enters]\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Amal!\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  He's asleep.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  I have some flowers for him.  Mayn't I give them into his\r\nown hand?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  Yes, you may.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  When will he be awake?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  Directly the King comes and calls him.\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Will you whisper a word for me in his ear?\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN.  What shall I say?\r\n\r\nSUDHA.  Tell him Sudha has not forgotten him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTAIN",

nation\r\ngrows forward. No little of the charm of European travel is ascribed to\r\nthe glamour that history and fable have flung around old churches,\r\ncastles, and the favored haunts of tourists, and the Rhine and Hudson are\r\nfrequently compared, to the prejudice of the latter, not because its\r\nscenery lacks in loveliness or grandeur, but that its beauty has not been\r\nhumanized by love of chivalry or faerie, as that of the older stream has\r\nbeen. Yet the record of our country's progress is of deep import, and as\r\ntime goes on the figures seen against the morning twilight of our history\r\nwill rise to more commanding stature, and the mists of legend will invest\r\nthem with a softness or glory that shall make reverence for them\r\nspontaneous and deep. Washington hurling the stone across the Potomac may\r\nlive as the Siegfried of some Western saga, and Franklin invoking the\r\nlightnings may be the Loki of our mythology. The bibliography of American\r\nlegends is slight, and these tales have been gathered from sources the\r\nmost diverse: records, histories, newspapers, magazines, oral\r\nnarrative--in every case reconstructed. The pursuit of them has been so\r\nlong that a claim may be set forth for some measure of completeness.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the episodes of our four historic centuries may furnish to\r\nthe poet, painter, dramatist, or legend-building idealist of the future,\r\nit is certain that we are not devoid of myth and folk-lore. Some\r\ncharacters, prosaic enough, perhaps, in daily life, have impinged so\r\nlightly on society before and after perpetrating their one or two great\r\ndeeds, that they have already become shadowy and their achievements have\r\nacquired a color of the supernatural. It is where myth and history\r\ncombine that legend is most interesting and appeals to our fancy or our\r\nsympathy most strongly; and it is not too early for us to begin the\r\ncollation of those quaint happenings and those spoken reports that gain\r\nin picturesqueness with each transmission. An attempt has been made in\r\nthis instance to assemble only legends, for, doubtful as some historians\r\nprofess to find them, certain occurrences, like the story of Captain\r\nSmith and Pocahontas, and the ride of General Putnam down Breakneck\r\nStairs, are taught as history; while as to folk-lore, that of the Indian\r\ntribes and of the Southern negro is too copious to be recounted in this\r\nwork. It will be noted that traditions do not thrive in brick and\r\nbrownstone, and that the stories once rife in the colonial cities have\r\nalmost as effectually disappeared as the architectural landmarks of last\r\ncentury. The field entered by the writer is not untrodden. Hawthorne and\r\nIrving have made paths across it, and it is hoped that others may deem\r\nits farther exploration worthy of their efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUDSON AND ITS HILLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIP VAN WINKLE\r\n\r\nThe story of Rip Van Winkle, told by Irving, dramatized by Boucicault,\r\nacted by Jefferson, pictured by Darley, set to music by Bristow, is the\r\nbest known of American legends. Rip was a real personage, and the Van\r\nWinkles are a considerable family at this day. An idle, good-natured,\r\nhappy-go-lucky fellow, he lived, presumably, in the village of Catskill,\r\nand began his long sleep in 1769. His wife was a shrew, and to escape her\r\nabuse Rip often took his dog and gun and roamed away to the Catskills,\r\nnine miles westward, where he lounged or hunted, as the humor seized him.\r\nIt was on a September evening, during a jaunt on South Mountain, that he\r\nmet a stubby, silent man, of goodly girth, his round head topped with a\r\nsteeple hat, the skirts of his belted coat and flaps of his petticoat\r\ntrousers meeting at the tops of heavy boots, and the face--ugh!--green\r\nand ghastly, with unmoving eyes that glimmered in the twilight like\r\nphosphorus. The dwarf carried a keg, and on receiving an intimation, in a\r\nsign, that he would like Rip to relieve him of it, that cheerful vagabond\r\nshouldered it and marched on up the mountain.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall they emerged on a little plateau where a score of men in the\r\ngarb of long ago, with faces like that of Rip's guide, and equally still\r\nand speechless, were playing bowls with great solemnity, the balls\r\nsometimes rolling over the plateau's edge and rumbling down the rocks\r\nwith a boom like thunder. A cloaked and snowy-bearded figure, watching\r\naloof, turned like the others, and gazed uncomfortably at the visitor who\r\nnow came blundering in among them. Rip was at first for making off, but\r\nthe sinister glare in the circle of eyes took the run out of his legs,\r\nand he was not displeased when they signed to him to tap the keg and join\r\nin a draught of the ripest schnapps that ever he had tasted,--and he knew\r\nthe flavor of every brand in Catskill. While these strange men grew no\r\nmore genial with passing of the flagons, Rip was pervaded by a satisfying\r\nglow; then, overcome by sleepiness and resting his head on a stone, he\r\nstretched his tired legs out and fell to dreaming.\r\n\r\nMorning. Sunlight and leaf shadow were dappled over the earth when he\r\nawoke, and rising stiffly from his bed, with compunctions in his bones,\r\nhe reached for his gun. The already venerable implement was so far gone\r\nwith rot and rust that it fell to pieces in his hand, and looking down at\r\nthe fragments of it, he saw that his clothes were dropping from his body\r\nin rags and mould, while a white beard flowed over his breast. Puzzled\r\nand alarmed, shaking his head ruefully as he recalled the carouse of the\r\nsilent, he hobbled down the mountain as fast as he might for the grip of\r\nthe rheumatism on his knees and elbows, and entered his native village.\r\nWhat! Was this Catskill? Was this the place that he left yesterday? Had\r\nall these houses sprung up overnight, and these streets been pushed\r\nacross the meadows in a day? The people, too: where were his friends? The\r\nchildren who had romped with him, the rotund topers whom he had left\r\ncooling their hot noses in pewter pots at the tavern door, the dogs that\r\nused to bark a welcome, recognizing in him a kindred spirit of vagrancy:\r\nwhere were they?\r\n\r\nAnd his wife, whose athletic arm and agile tongue had half disposed him\r\nto linger in the mountains how happened it that she was not awaiting him\r\nat the gate? But gate there was none in the familiar place: an unfenced\r\nyard of weeds and ruined foundation wall were there. Rip's home was gone.\r\nThe idlers jeered at his bent, lean form, his snarl of beard and hair,\r\nhis disreputable dress, his look of grieved astonishment. He stopped,\r\ninstinctively, at the tavern, for he knew that place in spite of its new\r\nsign: an officer in blue regimentals and a cocked hat replacing the\r\ncrimson George III. of his recollection, and labelled \"General\r\nWashington.\" There was a quick gathering of ne'er-do-weels, of\r\ntavern-haunters and gaping 'prentices, about him, and though their faces\r\nwere strange and their manners rude, he made bold to ask if they knew\r\nsuch and such of his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Nick Vedder? He's dead and gone these eighteen years.\" \"Brom Dutcher? He\r\njoined the army and was killed at Stony Point.\" \"Van Brummel? He, too,\r\nwent to the war, and is in Congress now.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Rip Van Winkle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's here. That's him yonder.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Rip's utter confusion he saw before him a counterpart of himself,\r\nas young, lazy, ragged, and easy-natured as he remembered himself to be,\r\nyesterday--or, was it yesterday?\r\n\r\n\"That's young Rip,\" continued his informer. \"His father was Rip Van\r\nWinkle, too, but he went to the mountains twenty years ago and never came\r\nback. He probably fell over a cliff, or was carried off by Indians, or\r\neaten by bears.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago! Truly, it was so. Rip had slept for twenty years\r\nwithout awaking. He had left a peaceful colonial village; he returned to\r\na bustling republican town. How he eventually found, among the oldest\r\ninhabitants, some who admitted that they knew him; how he found a\r\ncomfortable home with his married daughter and the son who took after him\r\nso kindly; how he recovered from the effect of the tidings that his wife\r\nhad died of apoplexy, in a quarrel; how he resumed his seat at the tavern\r\ntap and smoked long pipes and told long yarns for the rest of his days,\r\nwere matters of record up to the beginning of this century.\r\n\r\nAnd a strange story Rip had to tell, for he had served as cup-bearer to\r\nthe dead crew of the Half Moon. He had quaffed a cup of Hollands with no\r\nother than Henry Hudson himself. Some say that Hudson's spirit has made\r\nits home amid these hills, that it may look into the lovely valley that\r\nhe discovered; but others hold that every twenty years he and his men\r\nassemble for a revel in the mountains that so charmed them when first\r\nseen swelling against the western heavens, and the liquor they drink on\r\nthis night has the bane of throwing any mortal who lips it into a slumber\r\nwhence nothing can arouse him until the day dawns when the crew shall\r\nmeet again. As you climb the east front of the mountains by the old\r\ncarriage road, you pass, half-way up the height, the stone that Rip Van\r\nWinkle slept on, and may see that it is slightly hollowed by his form.\r\nThe ghostly revellers are due in the Catskills in 1909, and let all\r\ntourists who are among the mountains in September of that year beware of\r\naccepting liquor from strangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATSKILL GNOMES\r\n\r\nBehind the New Grand Hotel, in the Catskills, is an amphitheatre of\r\nmountain that is held to be the place of which the Mohicans spoke when\r\nthey told of people there who worked in metals, and had bushy beards and\r\neyes like pigs. From the smoke of their forges, in autumn, came the haze\r\nof Indian summer; and when the moon was full, it was their custom to\r\nassemble on the edge of a precipice above the hollow and dance and caper\r\nuntil the night was nigh worn away. They brewed a liquor that had the\r\neffect of shortening the bodies and swelling the heads of all who drank\r\nit, and when Hudson and his crew visited the mountains, the pygmies held\r\na carouse in his honor and invited him to drink their liquor. The crew\r\nwent away, shrunken and distorted by the magic distillation, and thus it\r\nwas that Rip Van Winkle found them on the eve of his famous sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATSKILL WITCH\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch gave the name of Katzbergs to the mountains west of the\r\nHudson, by reason of the wild-cats and panthers that ranged there, they\r\nobliterated the beautiful Indian Ontiora, \"mountains of the sky.\" In one\r\ntradition of the red men these hills were bones of a monster that fed on\r\nhuman beings until the Great Spirit turned it into stone as it was\r\nfloundering toward the ocean to bathe. The two lakes near the summit were\r\nits eyes. These peaks were the home of an Indian witch, who adjusted the\r\nweather for the Hudson Valley with the certainty of a signal service\r\nbureau. It was she who let out the day and night in blessed alternation,\r\nholding back the one when the other was at large, for fear of conflict.\r\nOld moons she cut into stars as soon as she had hung new ones in the sky,\r\nand she was often seen perched on Round Top and North Mountain, spinning\r\nclouds and flinging them to the winds. Woe betide the valley residents if\r\nthey showed irreverence, for then the clouds were black and heavy, and\r\nthrough them she poured floods of rain and launched the lightnings,\r\ncausing disastrous freshets in the streams and blasting the wigwams of\r\nthe mockers. In a frolic humor she would take the form of a bear or deer\r\nand lead the Indian hunters anything but a merry dance, exposing them to\r\ntire and peril, and vanishing or assuming some terrible shape when they\r\nhad overtaken her. Sometimes she would lead them to the cloves and would\r\nleap into the air with a mocking \"Ho, ho!\" just as they stopped with a\r\nshudder at the brink of an abyss. Garden Rock was a spot where she was\r\noften found, and at its foot a lake once spread. This was held in such\r\nawe that an Indian would never wittingly pursue his quarry there; but\r\nonce a hunter lost his way and emerged from the forest at the edge of the\r\npond. Seeing a number of gourds in crotches of the trees he took one, but\r\nfearing the spirit he turned to leave so quickly that he stumbled and it\r\nfell. As it broke, a spring welled from it in such volume that the\r\nunhappy man was gulfed in its waters, swept to the edge of Kaaterskill\r\nclove and dashed on the rocks two hundred and sixty feet below. Nor did\r\nthe water ever cease to run, and in these times the stream born of the\r\nwitch's revenge is known as Catskill Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVENGE OF SHANDAKEN\r\n\r\nOn the rock platform where the Catskill Mountain House now stands,\r\ncommanding one of the fairest views in the world, old chief Shandaken set\r\nhis wigwam,--for it is a mistake to suppose that barbarians are\r\nindifferent to beauty,--and there his daughter, Lotowana, was sought in\r\nmarriage by his braves. She, however, kept faith to an early vow\r\nexchanged with a young chief of the Mohawks. A suitor who was\r\nparticularly troublesome was Norsereddin, proud, morose, dark-featured, a\r\nstranger to the red man, a descendant, so he claimed, from Egyptian\r\nkings, and who lived by himself on Kaaterskill Creek, appearing among\r\nwhite settlements but rarely.\r\n\r\nOn one of his visits to Catskill, a tavern-lounging Dutchman wagered him\r\na thousand golden crowns that he could not win Lotowana, and, stung by\r\navarice as well as inflamed by passion, Norsereddin laid new siege to her\r\nheart. Still the girl refused to listen, and Shandaken counselled him to\r\nbe content with the smiles of others, thereby so angering the Egyptian\r\nthat he assailed the chief and was driven from the camp with blows; but\r\non the day of Lotowana's wedding with the Mohawk he returned, and in a\r\nhoneyed speech asked leave to give a jewel to the bride to show that he\r\nhad stifled jealousy and ill will. The girl took the handsome box he gave\r\nher and drew the cover, when a spring flew forward, driving into her hand\r\nthe poisoned tooth of a snake that had been affixed to it. The venom was\r\nstrong, and in a few minutes Lotowana lay dead at her husband's feet.\r\n\r\nThough the Egyptian had disappeared into the forest directly on the\r\nacceptance of his treacherous gift, twenty braves set off in pursuit, and\r\novertaking him on the Kalkberg, they dragged him back to the rock where\r\nfather and husband were bewailing the maid's untimely fate. A pile of\r\nfagots was heaped within a few feet of the precipice edge, and tying\r\ntheir captive on them, they applied the torch, dancing about with cries\r\nof exultation as the shrieks of the wretch echoed from the cliffs. The\r\ndead girl was buried by the mourning tribe, while the ashes of\r\nNorsereddin were left to be blown abroad. On the day of his revenge\r\nShandaken left his ancient dwelling-place, and his camp-fires never\r\nglimmered afterward on the front of Ontiora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDEMNED TO THE NOOSE\r\n\r\nRalph Sutherland, who, early in the last century, occupied a stone house\r\na mile from Leeds, in the Catskills, was a man of morose and violent\r\ndisposition, whose servant, a Scotch girl, was virtually a slave,\r\ninasmuch as she was bound to work for him without pay until she had\r\nrefunded to him her passage-money to this country. Becoming weary of\r\nbondage and of the tempers of her master, the girl ran away. The man set\r\noff in a raging chase, and she had not gone far before Sutherland\r\novertook her, tied her by the wrists to his horse's tail, and began the\r\nhomeward journey. Afterward, he swore that the girl stumbled against the\r\nhorse's legs, so frightening the animal that it rushed off madly,\r\npitching him out of the saddle and dashing the servant to death on rocks\r\nand trees; yet, knowing how ugly-tempered he could be, his neighbors were\r\nbetter inclined to believe that he had driven the horse into a gallop,\r\nintending to drag the girl for a short distance, as a punishment, and to\r\nrein up before he had done serious mischief. On this supposition he was\r\narrested, tried, and sentenced to die on the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe tricks of circumstantial evidence, together with pleas advanced by\r\ninfluential relatives of the prisoner, induced the court to delay\r\nsentence until the culprit should be ninety-nine years old, but it was\r\nordered that, while released on his own recognizance, in the interim, he\r\nshould keep a hangman's noose about his neck and show himself before the\r\njudges in Catskill once every year, to prove that he wore his badge of\r\ninfamy and kept his crime in mind. This sentence he obeyed, and there\r\nwere people living recently who claimed to remember him as he went about\r\nwith a silken cord knotted at his throat. He was always alone, he seldom\r\nspoke, his rough, imperious manner had departed. Only when children asked\r\nhim what the rope was for were his lips seen to quiver, and then he would\r\nhurry away. After dark his house was avoided, for gossips said that a\r\nshrieking woman passed it nightly, tied at the tail of a giant horse with\r\nfiery eyes and smoking nostrils; that a skeleton in a winding sheet had\r\nbeen found there; that a curious thing, somewhat like a woman, had been\r\nknown to sit on his garden wall, with lights shining from her\r\nfinger-tips, uttering unearthly laughter; and that domestic animals\r\nreproached the man by groaning and howling beneath his windows.\r\n\r\nThese beliefs he knew, yet he neither grieved, nor scorned, nor answered\r\nwhen he was told of them. Years sped on. Every year deepened his reserve\r\nand loneliness, and some began to whisper that he would take his own way\r\nout of the world, though others answered that men who were born to be\r\nhanged would never be drowned; but a new republic was created; new laws\r\nwere made; new judges sat to minister them; so, on Ralph Sutherland's\r\nninety-ninth birthday anniversary, there were none who would accuse him\r\nor execute sentence. He lived yet another year, dying in 1801. But was it\r\nfrom habit, or was it in self-punishment and remorse, that he never took\r\noff the cord? for, when he drew his last breath, though it was in his own\r\nhouse, his throat was still encircled by the hangman's rope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG INDIAN\r\n\r\nIntermarriages between white people and red ones in this country were not\r\nuncommon in the days when our ancestors led as rude a life as the\r\nnatives, and several places in the Catskills commemorate this fact. Mount\r\nUtsayantha, for example, is named for an Indian woman whose life, with\r\nthat of her baby and her white husband, was lost there. For the white men\r\nearly found friends among these mountains. As far back as 1663 they\r\nspared Catherine Dubois and her three children, after some rash spirits\r\nhad abducted them and carried them to a place on the upper Walkill, to do\r\nthem to death; for the captives raised a Huguenot hymn and the hearts of\r\ntheir captors were softened.\r\n\r\nIn Esopus Valley lived Winnisook, whose height was seven feet, and who\r\nwas known among the white settlers as \"the big Indian.\" He loved a white\r\ngirl of the neighborhood, one Gertrude Molyneux, and had asked for her\r\nhand; but while she was willing, the objections of her family were too\r\nstrong to be overcome, and she was teased into marriage with Joseph\r\nBundy, of her own race, instead. She liked the Indian all the better\r\nafter that, however, because Bundy proved to be a bad fellow, and\r\nbelieving that she could be happier among barbarians than among a people\r\nthat approved such marriages, she eloped with Winnisook. For a long time\r\nall trace of the runaway couple was lost, but one day the man having gone\r\ndown to the plain to steal cattle, it was alleged, was discovered by some\r\nfarmers who knew him, and who gave hot chase, coming up with him at the\r\nplace now called Big Indian.\r\n\r\nForemost in the chase was Bundy. As he came near to the enemy of his\r\npeace he exclaimed, \"I think the best way to civilize that yellow serpent\r\nis to let daylight into his heart,\" and, drawing his rifle to his\r\nshoulder, he fired. Mortally wounded, yet instinctively seeking refuge,\r\nthe giant staggered into the hollow of a pine-tree, where the farmers\r\nlost sight of him. There, however, he was found by Gertrude, bolt\r\nupright, yet dead. The unwedded widow brought her dusky children to the\r\nplace and spent the remainder of her days near his grave. Until a few\r\nyears ago the tree was still pointed out, but a railroad company has now\r\ncovered it with an embankment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAKER'S DOZEN\r\n\r\nBaas [Boss] Volckert Jan Pietersen Van Amsterdam kept a bake-shop in\r\nAlbany, and lives in history as the man who invented New Year cakes and\r\nmade gingerbread babies in the likeness of his own fat offspring. Good\r\nchurchman though he was, the bane of his life was a fear of being\r\nbewitched, and perhaps it was to keep out evil spirits, who might make\r\none last effort to gain the mastery over him, ere he turned the customary\r\nleaf with the incoming year, that he had primed himself with an extra\r\nglass of spirits on the last night of 1654. His sales had been brisk, and\r\nas he sat in his little shop, meditating comfortably on the gains he\r\nwould make when his harmless rivals--the knikkerbakkers (bakers of\r\nmarbles)--sent for their usual supply of olie-koeks and mince-pies on the\r\nmorrow, he was startled by a sharp rap, and an ugly old woman entered.\r\n\"Give me a dozen New Year's cookies!\" she cried, in a shrill voice.\r\n\r\n\"Vell, den, you needn' sbeak so loud. I aind teaf, den.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dozen!\" she screamed. \"Give me a dozen. Here are only twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vell, den, dwalf is a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"One more! I want a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vell, den, if you vant anodder, go to de duyvil and ged it.\"\r\n\r\nDid the hag take him at his word? She left the shop, and from that time\r\nit seemed as if poor Volckert was bewitched, indeed, for his cakes were\r\nstolen; his bread was so light that it went up the chimney, when it was\r\nnot so heavy that it fell through the oven; invisible hands plucked\r\nbricks from that same oven and pelted him until he was blue; his wife\r\nbecame deaf, his children went unkempt, and his trade went elsewhere.\r\nThrice the old woman reappeared, and each time was sent anew to the\r\ndevil; but at last, in despair, the baker called on Saint Nicolaus to\r\ncome and advise him. His call was answered with startling quickness, for,\r\nalmost while he was making it, the venerable patron of Dutch feasts stood\r\nbefore him. The good soul advised the trembling man to be more generous\r\nin his dealings with his fellows, and after a lecture on charity he\r\nvanished, when, lo! the old woman was there in his place.\r\n\r\nShe repeated her demand for one more cake, and Volckert Jan Pietersen,\r\netc., gave it, whereupon she exclaimed, \"The spell is broken, and from\r\nthis time a dozen is thirteen!\" Taking from the counter a gingerbread\r\neffigy of Saint Nicolaus, she made the astonished Dutchman lay his hand\r\nupon it and swear to give more liberal measure in the future. So, until\r\nthirteen new States arose from the ruins of the colonies,--when the\r\nshrewd Yankees restored the original measure,--thirteen made a baker's\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S DANCE-CHAMBER.\r\n\r\nMost storied of our New World rivers is the Hudson. Historic scenes have\r\nbeen enacted on its shores, and Indian, Dutchman, Briton, and American\r\nhave invested it with romance. It had its source, in the red man's fancy,\r\nin a spring of eternal youth; giants and spirits dwelt in its woods and\r\nhills, and before the river-Shatemuc, king of streams, the red men called\r\nit--had broken through the highlands, those mountains were a pent for\r\nspirits who had rebelled against the Manitou. After the waters had forced\r\na passage to the sea these evil ones sought shelter in the glens and\r\nvalleys that open to right and left along its course, but in time of\r\ntempest, when they hear Manitou riding down the ravine on wings of storm,\r\ndashing thunderbolts against the cliffs, it is the fear that he will\r\nrecapture them and force them into lightless caverns to expiate their\r\nrevolt, that sends them huddling among the rocks and makes the hills\r\nresound with roars and howls.\r\n\r\nAt the Devil's Dance-Chamber, a slight plateau on the west bank, between\r\nNewburg and Crom Elbow, the red men performed semi-religious rites as a\r\npreface to their hunting and fishing trips or ventures on the war-path.\r\nThey built a fire, painted themselves, and in that frenzy into which\r\nsavages are so readily lashed, and that is so like to the action of mobs\r\nin trousers, they tumbled, leaped, danced, yelled, sang, grimaced, and\r\ngesticulated until the Manitou disclosed himself, either as a harmless\r\nanimal or a beast of prey. If he came in the former shape the augury was\r\nfavorable, but if he showed himself as a bear or panther, it was a\r\nwarning of evil that they seldom dared to disregard.\r\n\r\nThe crew of Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, having chanced on one of these\r\norgies, were so impressed by the fantastic spectacle that they gave the\r\nname Duyvels Dans-Kamer to the spot. Years afterwards, when Stuyvesant\r\nascended the river, his doughty retainers were horrified, on landing\r\nbelow the Dans-Kamer, to discover hundreds of painted figures frisking\r\nthere in the fire-light. A few surmised that they were but a new\r\ngeneration of savages holding a powwow, but most of the sailors fancied\r\nthat the assemblage was demoniac, and that the figures were spirits of\r\nbad Indians repeating a scalp-dance and revelling in the mysterious\r\nfire-water that they had brought down from the river source in jars and\r\nskins. The spot was at least once profaned with blood, for a young\r\nDutchman and his wife, of Albany, were captured here by an angry Indian,\r\nand although the young man succeeded in stabbing his captor to death, he\r\nwas burned alive on the rock by the friends of the Indian whose wrath he\r\nhad provoked. The wife, after being kept in captivity for a time, was\r\nransomed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CULPRIT FAY\r\n\r\nThe wood-tick's drum convokes the elves at the noon of night on Cro' Nest\r\ntop, and, clambering out of their flower-cup beds and hammocks of cobweb,\r\nthey fly to the meeting, not to freak about the grass or banquet at the\r\nmushroom table, but to hear sentence passed on the fay who, forgetting\r\nhis vestal vow, has loved an earthly maid. From his throne under a canopy\r\nof tulip petals, borne on pillars of shell, the king commands silence,\r\nand with severe eye but softened voice he tells the culprit that while he\r\nhas scorned the royal decree he has saved himself from the extreme\r\npenalty, of imprisonment in walnut shells and cobweb dungeons, by loving\r\na maid who is gentle and pure. So it shall be enough if he will go down\r\nto the Hudson and seize a drop from the bow of mist that a sturgeon\r\nleaves when he makes his leap; and after, to kindle his darkened\r\nflame-wood lamp at a meteor spark. The fairy bows, and without a word\r\nslowly descends the rocky steep, for his wing is soiled and has lost its\r\npower; but once at the river, he tugs amain at a mussel shell till he has\r\nit afloat; then, leaping in, he paddles out with a strong grass blade\r\ntill he comes to the spot where the sturgeon swims, though the\r\nwatersprites plague him and toss his boat, and the fish and the leeches\r\nbunt and drag; but, suddenly, the sturgeon shoots from the water, and ere\r\nthe arch of mist that he tracks through the air has vanished, the sprite\r\nhas caught a drop of the spray in a tiny blossom, and in this he washes\r\nclean his wings.\r\n\r\nThe water-goblins torment him no longer. They push his boat to the shore,\r\nwhere, alighting, he kisses his hand, then, even as a bubble, he flies\r\nback to the mountain top, dons his acorn helmet, his corselet of\r\nbee-hide, his shield of lady-bug shell, and grasping his lance, tipped\r\nwith wasp sting, he bestrides his fire-fly steed and off he goes like a\r\nflash. The world spreads out and then grows small, but he flies straight\r\non. The ice-ghosts leer from the topmost clouds, and the mists surge\r\nround, but he shakes his lance and pipes his call, and at last he comes\r\nto the Milky Way, where the sky-sylphs lead him to their queen, who lies\r\ncouched in a palace ceiled with stars, its dome held up by northern\r\nlights and the curtains made of the morning's flush. Her mantle is\r\ntwilight purple, tied with threads of gold from the eastern dawn, and her\r\nface is as fair as the silver moon.\r\n\r\nShe begs the fay to stay with her and taste forever the joys of heaven,\r\nbut the knightly elf keeps down the beating of his heart, for he\r\nremembers a face on earth that is fairer than hers, and he begs to go.\r\nWith a sigh she fits him a car of cloud, with the fire-fly steed chained\r\non behind, and he hurries away to the northern sky whence the meteor\r\ncomes, with roar and whirl, and as it passes it bursts to flame. He\r\nlights his lamp at a glowing spark, then wheels away to the fairy-land.\r\nHis king and his brothers hail him stoutly, with song and shout, and\r\nfeast and dance, and the revel is kept till the eastern sky has a ruddy\r\nstreak. Then the cock crows shrill and the fays are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOKEPSIE\r\n\r\nThe name of this town has forty-two spellings in old records, and with\r\nsingular pertinacity in ill-doing, the inhabitants have fastened on it\r\nthe longest and clumsiest of all. It comes from the Mohegan words\r\nApo-keep-sink, meaning a safe, pleasant harbor. Harbor it might be for\r\ncanoes, but for nothing bigger, for it was only the little cove that was\r\nso called between Call Rock and Adder Cliff,--the former indicating where\r\nsettlers awaiting passage hailed the masters of vessels from its top, and\r\nthe latter taking its name from the snakes that abounded there.\r\n\r\nHither came a band of Delawares with Pequot captives, among them a young\r\nchief to whom had been offered not only life but leadership if he would\r\nrenounce his tribe, receive the mark of the turtle on his breast, and\r\nbecome a Delaware. On his refusal, he was bound to a tree, and was about\r\nto undergo the torture, when a girl among the listeners sprang to his\r\nside. She, too, was a Pequot, but the turtle totem was on her bosom, and\r\nwhen she begged his life, because they had been betrothed, the captors\r\npaused to talk of it. She had chosen well the time to interfere, for a\r\nband of Hurons was approaching, and even as the talk went on their yell\r\nwas heard in the wood. Instant measures for defence were taken, and in\r\nthe fight that followed both chief and maiden were forgotten; but though\r\nshe cut the cords that bound him, they were separated in the confusion,\r\nhe disappearing, she falling captive to the Hurons, who, sated with\r\nblood, retired from the field. In the fantastic disguise of a wizard the\r\nyoung Pequot entered their camp soon after, and on being asked to try his\r\nenchantments for the cure of a young woman, he entered her tent, showing\r\nno surprise at finding her to be the maiden of his choice, who was\r\nsuffering from nothing worse than nerves, due to the excitement of the\r\nbattle. Left alone with his patient, he disclosed his identity, and\r\nplanned a way of escape that proved effective on that very night, for,\r\nthough pursued by the angry Hurons, the couple reached \"safe harbor,\"\r\nthence making a way to their own country in the east, where they were\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNDERBERG\r\n\r\nDunderberg, \"Thunder Mountain,\" at the southern gate of the Hudson\r\nHighlands, is a wooded eminence, chiefly populated by a crew of imps of\r\nstout circumference, whose leader, the Heer, is a bulbous goblin clad in\r\nthe dress worn by Dutch colonists two centuries ago, and carrying a\r\nspeaking-trumpet, through which he bawls his orders for the blowing of\r\nwinds and the touching off of lightnings. These orders are given in Low\r\nDutch, and are put into execution by the imps aforesaid, who troop into\r\nthe air and tumble about in the mist, sometimes smiting the flag or\r\ntopsail of a ship to ribbons, or laying the vessel over before the wind\r\nuntil she is in peril of going on beam ends. At one time a sloop passing\r\nthe Dunderberg had nearly foundered, when the crew discovered the\r\nsugar-loaf hat of the Heer at the mast-head. None dared to climb for it,\r\nand it was not until she had driven past Pollopel's Island--the limit of\r\nthe Heer's jurisdiction--that she righted. As she did so the little hat\r\nspun into the air like a top, creating a vortex that drew up the\r\nstorm-clouds, and the sloop kept her way prosperously for the rest of the\r\nvoyage. The captain had nailed a horse-shoe to the mast. The \"Hat Rogue\"\r\nof the Devil's Bridge in Switzerland must be a relative of this gamesome\r\nsprite, for his mischief is usually of a harmless sort; but, to be on the\r\nsafe side, the Dutchmen who plied along the river lowered their peaks in\r\nhomage to the keeper of the mountain, and for years this was a common\r\npractice. Mariners who paid this courtesy to the Heer of the Donder Berg\r\nwere never molested by his imps, though skipper Ouselsticker, of\r\nFishkill,--for all he had a parson on board,--was once beset by a heavy\r\nsquall, and the goblin came out of the mist and sat astraddle of his\r\nbowsprit, seeming to guide his schooner straight toward the rocks. The\r\ndominie chanted the song of Saint Nicolaus, and the goblin, unable to\r\nendure either its spiritual potency or the worthy parson's singing, shot\r\nupward like a ball and rode off on the gale, carrying with him the\r\nnightcap of the parson's wife, which he hung on the weathercock of Esopus\r\nsteeple, forty miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY'S NOSE\r\n\r\nThe Hudson Highlands are suggestively named Bear Mountain, Sugar Loaf,\r\nCro' Nest, Storm King, called by the Dutch Boterberg, or Butter Hill,\r\nfrom its likeness to a pat of butter; Beacon Hill, where the fires blazed\r\nto tell the country that the Revolutionary war was over; Dunderberg,\r\nMount Taurus, so called because a wild bull that had terrorized the\r\nHighlands was chased out of his haunts on this height, and was killed by\r\nfalling from a cliff on an eminence to the northward, known, in\r\nconsequence, as Breakneck Hill. These, with Anthony's Nose, are the\r\nprincipal points of interest in the lovely and impressive panorama that\r\nunfolds before the view as the boats fly onward.\r\n\r\nConcerning the last-named elevation, the aquiline promontory that abuts\r\non the Hudson opposite Dunderberg, it takes title from no resemblance to\r\nthe human feature, but is so named because Anthony Van Corlaer, the\r\ntrumpeter, who afterwards left a reason for calling the upper boundary of\r\nManhattan Island Spuyten Duyvil Creek, killed the first sturgeon ever\r\neaten at the foot of this mountain. It happened in this wise: By\r\nassiduous devotion to keg and flagon Anthony had begotten a nose that was\r\nthe wonder and admiration of all who knew it, for its size was\r\nprodigious; in color it rivalled the carbuncle, and it shone like\r\npolished copper. As Anthony was lounging over the quarter of Peter\r\nStuyvesant's galley one summer morning this nose caught a ray from the\r\nsun and reflected it hissing into the water, where it killed a sturgeon\r\nthat was rising beside the vessel. The fish was pulled aboard, eaten, and\r\ndeclared good, though the singed place savored of brimstone, and in\r\ncommemoration of the event Stuyvesant dubbed the mountain that rose above\r\nhis vessel Anthony's Nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOODUA CREEK\r\n\r\nMoodua is an evolution, through Murdy's and Moodna, from Murderer's\r\nCreek, its present inexpressive name having been given to it by N. P.\r\nWillis. One Murdock lived on its shore with his wife, two sons, and a\r\ndaughter; and often in the evening Naoman, a warrior of a neighboring\r\ntribe, came to the cabin, caressed the children, and shared the woodman's\r\nhospitality. One day the little girl found in the forest an arrow wrapped\r\nin snake-skin and tipped with crow's feather; then the boy found a\r\nhatchet hanging by a hair from a bough above the door; then a glare of\r\nevil eyes was caught for an instant in a thicket. Naoman, when he came,\r\nwas reserved and stern, finding voice only to warn the family to fly that\r\nnight; so, when all was still, the threatened family made its way softly,\r\nbut quickly, to the Hudson shore, and embarked for Fisher's Kill, across\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nThe wind lagged and their boat drew heavily, and when, from the shade of\r\nPollopel's Island, a canoe swept out, propelled by twelve men, the hearts\r\nof the people in the boat sank in despair. The wife was about to leap\r\nover, but Murdock drew her back; then, loading and firing as fast as\r\npossible, he laid six of his pursuers low; but the canoe was savagely\r\nurged forward, and in another minute every member of the family was a\r\nhelpless captive. When the skiff had been dragged back, the prisoners\r\nwere marched through the wood to an open spot where the principal members\r\nof the tribe sat in council.\r\n\r\nThe sachem arose, twisted his hands in the woman's golden hair, bared his\r\nknife, and cried, \"Tell us what Indian warned you and betrayed his tribe,\r\nor you shall see husband and children bleed before your eyes.\" The woman\r\nanswered never a word, but after a little Naoman arose and said, \"'Twas\r\nI;\" then drew his blanket about him and knelt for execution. An axe cleft\r\nhis skull. Drunk with the sight of blood, the Indians rushed upon the\r\ncaptives and slew them, one by one. The prisoners neither shrank nor\r\ncried for mercy, but met their end with hymns upon their lips, and,\r\nseeing that they could so meet death, one member of the band let fall his\r\narm and straight became a Christian. The cabin was burned, the bodies\r\nflung into the stream, and the stain of blood was seen for many a year in\r\nMurderer's Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRAPPER'S GHASTLY VENGEANCE\r\n\r\nAbout a mile back from the Hudson, at Coxsackie, stood the cabin of Nick\r\nWolsey, who, in the last century, was known to the river settlements as a\r\nhunter and trapper of correct aim, shrewdness, endurance, and taciturn\r\nhabit. For many years he lived in this cabin alone, except for the\r\ncompany of his dog; but while visiting a camp of Indians in the\r\nwilderness he was struck with the engaging manner of one of the girls of\r\nthe tribe; he repeated the visit; he found cause to go to the camp\r\nfrequently; he made presents to the father of the maid, and at length won\r\nher consent to be his wife. The simple marriage ceremony of the tribe was\r\nperformed, and Wolsey led Minamee to his home; but the wedding was\r\ninterrupted in an almost tragic manner, for a surly fellow who had loved\r\nthe girl, yet who never had found courage to declare himself, was wrought\r\nto such a jealous fury at the discovery of Wolsey's good fortune that he\r\nsprang at him with a knife, and would have despatched him on the spot had\r\nnot the white man's faithful hound leaped at his throat and borne him to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWolsey disarmed the fellow and kicked and cuffed him to the edge of the\r\nwood, while the whole company shouted with laughter at this ignominious\r\npunishment, and approved it. A year or more passed. Wolsey and his Indian\r\nwife were happy in their free and simple life; happy, too, in their\r\nlittle babe. Wolsey was seldom absent from his cabin for any considerable\r\nlength of time, and usually returned to it before the night set in. One\r\nevening he noticed that the grass and twigs were bent near his house by\r\nsome passing foot that, with the keen eye of the woodman, he saw was not\r\nhis wife's.\r\n\r\n\"Some hunter,\" he said, \"saw the house when he passed here, and as,\r\nbelike, he never saw one before, he stopped to look in.\" For the trail\r\nled to his window, and diverged thence to the forest again. A few days\r\nlater, as he was returning, he came on the footprints that were freshly\r\nmade, and a shadow crossed his face. On nearing the door he stumbled on\r\nthe body of his dog, lying rigid on the ground. \"How did this happen,\r\nMinamee?\" he cried, as he flung open the door. The wife answered, in a\r\nlow voice, \"O Hush! you'll wake the child.\"\r\n\r\nNick Wolsey entered the cabin and stood as one turned to marble. Minamee,\r\nhis wife, sat on the gold hearth, her face and hands cut and blackened,\r\nher dress torn, her eyes glassy, a meaningless smile on her lips. In her\r\narms she pressed the body of her infant, its dress soaked with blood, and\r\nthe head of the little creature lay on the floor beside her. She crooned\r\nsoftly over the cold clay as if hushing it to sleep, and when Wolsey at\r\nlength found words, she only whispered, \"Hush! you will wake him.\" The\r\nnight went heavily on; day dawned, and the crooning became lower and\r\nlower; still, through all that day the bereft woman rocked to and fro\r\nupon the floor, and the agonized husband hung about her, trying in vain\r\nto give comfort, to bind her wounds, to get some explanation of the\r\nmystery that confronted him. The second night set in, and it was evident\r\nthat it would be the last for Minamee. Her strength failed until she\r\nallowed herself to be placed on a couch of skins, while the body of her\r\nchild was gently lifted from her arms. Then, for a few brief minutes, her\r\nreason was restored, and she found words to tell her husband how the\r\nIndian whose murderous attack he had thwarted at the wedding had come to\r\nthe cabin, shot the dog that had rushed out to defend the place, beat the\r\nwoman back from the door, tore the baby from its bed, slashed its head\r\noff with a knife, and, flinging the little body into her lap, departed\r\nwith the words, \"This is my revenge. I am satisfied.\" Before the sun was\r\nin the east again Minamee was with her baby.\r\n\r\nWolsey sat for hours in the ruin of his happiness, his breathing alone\r\nproving that he was alive, and when at last he arose and went out of the\r\nhouse, there were neither tears nor outcry; he saddled his horse and rode\r\noff to the westward. At nightfall he came to the Indian village where he\r\nhad won his wife, and relating to the assembled tribe what had happened,\r\nhe demanded that the murderer be given up to him. His demand was readily\r\ngranted, whereupon the white man advanced on the cowering wretch, who had\r\nconfidently expected the protection of his people, and with the quick\r\nfling and jerk of a raw-hide rope bound his arms to his side. Then\r\ncasting a noose about his neck and tying the end of it to his saddle-bow,\r\nhe set off for the Hudson. All that night he rode, the Indian walking and\r\nrunning at the horse's heels, and next day he reached his cabin. Tying\r\nhis prisoner to a tree, the trapper cut a quantity of young willows, from\r\nwhich he fashioned a large cradle-like receptacle; in this he placed the\r\nculprit, face upward, and tied so stoutly that he could not move a\r\nfinger; then going into his house, he emerged with the body of Minamee,\r\nand laid it, face downward, on the wretch, who could not repress a groan\r\nof horror as the awful burden sank on his breast. Wolsey bound together\r\nthe living and the dead, and with a swing of his powerful arms he flung\r\nthem on his horse's back, securing them there with so many turns of rope\r\nthat nothing could displace them. Now he began to lash his horse until\r\nthe poor beast trembled with anger and pain, when, flinging off the\r\nhalter, he gave it a final lash, and the animal plunged, foaming and\r\nsnorting, into the wilderness. When it had vanished and the hoof-beats\r\nwere no longer heard, Nick Wolsey took his rifle on his arm and left his\r\nhome forever. And tradition says that the horse never stopped in its mad\r\ncareer, but that on still nights it can be heard sweeping through the\r\nwoods along the Hudson and along the Mohawk like a whirlwind, and that as\r\nthe sound goes by a smothered voice breaks out in cursing, in appeal,\r\nthen in harsh and dreadful laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VANDERDECKEN OF TAPPAN ZEE\r\n\r\nIt is Saturday night; the swell of the Hudson lazily heaves against the\r\nshores of Tappan Zee, the cliff above Tarrytown where the white lady\r\ncries on winter nights is pale in starlight, and crickets chirp in the\r\nboskage. It is so still that the lap of oars can be heard coming across\r\nthe water at least a mile away. Some small boat, evidently, but of heavy\r\nbuild, for it takes a vigorous hand to propel it, and now there is a\r\ngrinding of oars on thole-pins. Strange that it is not yet seen, for the\r\nsound is near. Look! Is that a shadow crossing that wrinkle of starlight\r\nin the water? The oars have stopped, and there is no wind to make that\r\nsound of a sigh.\r\n\r\nHo, Rambout Van Dam! Is it you? Are you still expiating your oath to pull\r\nfrom Kakiat to Spuyten Duyvil before the dawn of Sabbath, if it takes you\r\na month of Sundays? Better for you had you passed the night with your\r\nroistering friends at Kakiat, or started homeward earlier, for\r\nSabbath-breaking is no sin now, and you, poor ghost, will find little\r\nsympathy for your plight. Grant that your month of Sundays, or your cycle\r\nof months of Sundays, be soon up, for it is sad to be reminded that we\r\nmay be punished for offences many years forgotten. When the sun is high\r\nto-morrow a score of barges will vex the sea of Tappan, each crowded with\r\nmen and maids from New Amsterdam, jigging to profane music and refreshing\r\nthemselves with such liquors as you, Rambout, never even smelled--be\r\nthankful for that much. If your shade sits blinking at them from the\r\nwooded buttresses of the Palisades, you must repine, indeed, at the\r\nhardness of your fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALLOPING HESSIAN\r\n\r\nIn the flower-gemmed cemetery of Tarrytown, where gentle Irving sleeps, a\r\nHessian soldier was interred after sustaining misfortune in the loss of\r\nhis head in one of the Revolutionary battles. For a long time after he\r\nwas buried it was the habit of this gentleman to crawl from his grave at\r\nunseemly hours and gallop about the country, sending shivers through the\r\nframes of many worthy people, who shrank under their blankets when they\r\nheard the rush of hoofs along the unlighted roads.\r\n\r\nIn later times there lived in Tarrytown--so named because of the tarrying\r\nhabits of Dutch gossips on market days, though some hard-minded people\r\ninsist that Tarwe-town means Wheat-towna gaunt schoolmaster, one Ichabod\r\nCrane, who cherished sweet sentiments for Katrina Van Tassell, the buxom\r\ndaughter of a farmer, also a famous maker of pies and doughnuts. Ichabod\r\nhad been calling late one evening, and, his way home being long,\r\nKatrina's father lent him a horse to make the journey; but even with this\r\nadvantage the youth set out with misgivings, for he had to pass the\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nAs it was near the hour when the Hessian was to ride, he whistled feebly\r\nto keep his courage up, but when he came to the dreaded spot the whistle\r\ndied in a gasp, for he heard the tread of a horse. On looking around, his\r\nhair bristled and his heart came up like a plug in his throat to hinder\r\nhis breathing, for he saw a headless horseman coming over the ridge\r\nbehind him, blackly defined against the starry sky. Setting spurs to his\r\nnag with a hope of being first to reach Sleepy Hollow bridge, which the\r\nspectre never passed, the unhappy man made the best possible time in that\r\ndirection, for his follower was surely overtaking him. Another minute and\r\nthe bridge would be reached; but, to Ichabod's horror, the Hessian dashed\r\nalongside and, rising in his stirrups, flung his head full at the\r\nfugitive's back. With a squeal of fright the schoolmaster rolled into a\r\nmass of weeds by the wayside, and for some minutes he remained there,\r\nknowing and remembering nothing.\r\n\r\nNext morning farmer Van Tassell's horse was found grazing in a field near\r\nSleepy Hollow, and a man who lived some miles southward reported that he\r\nhad seen Mr. Crane striding as rapidly along the road to New York as his\r\nlean legs could take him, and wearing a pale and serious face as he kept\r\nhis march. There were yellow stains on the back of his coat, and the man\r\nwho restored the horse found a smashed pumpkin in the broken bushes\r\nbeside the road. Ichabod never returned to Tarrytown, and when Brom\r\nBones, a stout young ploughman and taphaunter, married Katrina, people\r\nmade bold to say that he knew more about the galloping Hessian than any\r\none else, though they believed that he never had reason to be jealous of\r\nIchabod Crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORM SHIP OF THE HUDSON\r\n\r\nIt was noised about New Amsterdam, two hundred years ago, that a round\r\nand bulky ship flying Dutch colors from her lofty quarter was careering\r\nup the harbor in the teeth of a north wind, through the swift waters of\r\nan ebbing tide, and making for the Hudson. A signal from the Battery to\r\nheave to and account for herself being disregarded, a cannon was trained\r\nupon her, and a ball went whistling through her cloudy and imponderable\r\nmass, for timbers she had none. Some of the sailor-folk talked of mirages\r\nthat rose into the air of northern coasts and seas, but the wise ones put\r\ntheir fingers beside their noses and called to memory the Flying\r\nDutchman, that wanderer of the seas whose captain, having sworn that he\r\nwould round Cape Horn in spite of heaven and hell, has been beating to\r\nand fro along the bleak Fuegian coast and elsewhere for centuries, being\r\nallowed to land but once in seven years, when he can break the curse if\r\nhe finds a girl who will love him. Perhaps Captain Vanderdecken found\r\nthis maiden of his hopes in some Dutch settlement on the Hudson, or\r\nperhaps he expiated his rashness by prayer and penitence; howbeit, he\r\nnever came down again, unless he slipped away to sea in snow or fog so\r\ndense that watchers and boatmen saw nothing of his passing. A few old\r\nsettlers declared the vessel to be the Half Moon, and there were some who\r\ntestified to seeing that identical ship with Hudson and his spectre crew\r\non board making for the Catskills to hold carouse.\r\n\r\nThis fleeting vision has been confounded with the storm ship that lurks\r\nabout the foot of the Palisades and Point-no-Point, cruising through\r\nTappan Zee at night when a gale is coming up. The Hudson is four miles\r\nwide at Tappan, and squalls have space enough to gather force; hence,\r\nwhen old skippers saw the misty form of a ship steal out from the shadows\r\nof the western hills, then fly like a gull from shore to shore, catching\r\nthe moonlight on her topsails, but showing no lanterns, they made to\r\nwindward and dropped anchor, unless their craft were stanch and their\r\npilot's brains unvexed with liquor. On summer nights, when falls that\r\ncurious silence which is ominous of tempest, the storm ship is not only\r\nseen spinning across the mirror surface of the river, but the voices of\r\nthe crew are heard as they chant at the braces and halyards in words\r\ndevoid of meaning to the listeners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SPUYTEN DUYVIL IS SO NAMED\r\n\r\nThe tide-water creek that forms the upper boundary of Manhattan Island is\r\nknown to dwellers in tenements round about as \"Spittin' Divvle.\" The\r\nproper name of it is Spuyten Duyvil, and this, in turn, is the\r\ncompression of a celebrated boast by Anthony Van Corlaer. This\r\nredoubtable gentleman, famous for fat, long wind, and long whiskers, was\r\ntrumpeter for the garrison at New Amsterdam, which his countrymen had\r\njust bought for twenty-four dollars, and he sounded the brass so sturdily\r\nthat in the fight between the Dutch and Indians at the Dey Street peach\r\norchard his blasts struck more terror into the red men's hearts than did\r\nthe matchlocks of his comrades. William the Testy vowed that Anthony and\r\nhis trumpet were garrison enough for all Manhattan Island, for he argued\r\nthat no regiment of Yankees would approach near enough to be struck with\r\nlasting deafness, as must have happened if they came when Anthony was\r\nawake.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant-Peter the Headstrong--showed his appreciation of\r\nAnthony's worth by making him his esquire, and when he got news of an\r\nEnglish expedition on its way to seize his unoffending colony, he at once\r\nordered Anthony to rouse the villages along the Hudson with a trumpet\r\ncall to war. The esquire took a hurried leave of six or eight ladies,\r\neach of whom delighted to believe that his affections were lavished on\r\nher alone, and bravely started northward, his trumpet hanging on one\r\nside, a stone bottle, much heavier, depending from the other. It was a\r\nstormy evening when he arrived at the upper end of the island, and there\r\nwas no ferryman in sight, so, after fuming up and down the shore, he\r\nswallowed a mighty draught of Dutch courage,--for he was as accomplished\r\na performer on the horn as on the trumpet,--and swore with ornate and\r\nvoluminous oaths that he would swim the stream \"in spite of the devil\"\r\n[En spuyt den Duyvil].\r\n\r\nHe plunged in, and had gone half-way across when the Evil One, not to be\r\nspited, appeared as a huge moss-bunker, vomiting boiling water and\r\nlashing a fiery tail. This dreadful fish seized Anthony by the leg; but\r\nthe trumpeter was game, for, raising his instrument to his lips, he\r\nexhaled his last breath through it in a defiant blast that rang through\r\nthe woods for miles and made the devil himself let go for a moment. Then\r\nhe was dragged below, his nose shining through the water more and more\r\nfaintly, until, at last, all sight of him was lost. The failure of his\r\nmission resulted in the downfall of the Dutch in America, for, soon\r\nafter, the English won a bloodless victory, and St. George's cross\r\nflaunted from the ramparts where Anthony had so often saluted the setting\r\nsun. But it was years, even then, before he was hushed, for in stormy\r\nweather it was claimed that the shrill of his trumpet could be heard near\r\nthe creek that he had named, sounding above the deeper roar of the blast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAMAPO SALAMANDER\r\n\r\nA curious tale of the Rosicrucians runs to the effect that more than two\r\ncenturies ago a band of German colonists entered the Ramapo valley and\r\nput up houses of stone, like those they had left in the Hartz Mountains,\r\nand when the Indians saw how they made knives and other wonderful things\r\nout of metal, which they extracted from the rocks by fire, they believed\r\nthem to be manitous and went away, not wishing to resist their possession\r\nof the land. There was treasure here, for High Tor, or Torn Mountain, had\r\nbeen the home of Amasis, youngest of the magi who had followed the star\r\nof Bethlehem. He had found his way, through Asia and Alaska, to this\r\ncountry, had taken to wife a native woman, by whom he had a child, and\r\nhere on the summit he had built a temple. Having refused the sun worship,\r\nwhen the Indians demanded that he should take their faith, he was set\r\nupon, and would have been killed had not an earthquake torn the ground at\r\nhis feet, opening a new channel for the Hudson and precipitating into it\r\nevery one but the magus and his daughter. To him had been revealed in\r\nmagic vision the secrets of wealth in the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe leader in the German colony, one Hugo, was a man of noble origin, who\r\nhad a wife and two children: a boy, named after himself; a girl,--Mary.\r\nThough it had been the custom in the other country to let out the forge\r\nfires once in seven years, Hugo opposed that practice in the forge he had\r\nbuilt as needless. But his men murmured and talked of the salamander that\r\nonce in seven years attains its growth in unquenched flame and goes forth\r\ndoing mischief. On the day when that period was ended the master entered\r\nhis works and saw the men gazing into the furnace at a pale form that\r\nseemed made from flame, that was nodding and turning in the fire,\r\noccasionally darting its tongue at them or allowing its tail to fall out\r\nand lie along the stone floor. As he came to the door he, too, was\r\ntransfixed, and the fire seemed burning his vitals, until he felt water\r\nsprinkled on his face, and saw that his wife, whom he had left at home\r\ntoo ill to move, stood behind him and was casting holy water into the\r\nfurnace, speaking an incantation as she did so. At that moment a storm\r\narose, and a rain fell that put out the fire; but as the last glow faded\r\nthe lady fell dead.\r\n\r\nWhen her children were to be consecrated, seven years later, those who\r\nstood outside of the church during the ceremony saw a vivid flash, and\r\nthe nurse turned from the boy in her fright. She took her hands from her\r\neyes. The child was gone. Twice seven years had passed and the daughter\r\nremained unspotted by the world, for, on the night when her father had\r\nled her to the top of High Torn Mountain and shown her what Amasis had\r\nseen,--the earth spirits in their caves heaping jewels and offering to\r\ngive them if Hugo would speak the word that binds the free to the earth\r\nforces and bars his future for a thousand years,--it was her prayer that\r\nbrought him to his senses and made the scene below grow dim, though the\r\nbaleful light of the salamander clinging to the rocks at the bottom of\r\nthe cave sent a glow into the sky.\r\n\r\nMany nights after that the glow was seen on the height and Hugo was\r\nmissing from his home, but for lack of a pure soul to stand as\r\ninterpreter he failed to read the words that burned in the triangle on\r\nthe salamander's back, and returned in rage and jealousy. A knightly man\r\nhad of late appeared in the settlement, and between him and Mary a tender\r\nfeeling had arisen, that, however, was unexpressed until, after saving\r\nher from the attack of a panther, he had allowed her to fall into his\r\narms. She would willingly then have declared her love for him, but he\r\nplaced her gently and regretfully from him and said, \"When you slept I\r\ncame to you and put a crown of gems on your head: that was because I was\r\nin the power of the earth spirit. Then I had power only over the element\r\nof fire, that either consumes or hardens to stone; but now water and life\r\nare mine. Behold! Wear these, for thou art worthy.\" And touching the\r\ntears that had fallen from her eyes, they turned into lilies in his\r\nhands, and he put them on her brow.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we meet again?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said he. \"I tread the darkness of the universe alone,\r\nand I peril my redemption by yielding to this love of earth. Thou art\r\nredeemed already, but I must make my way back to God through obedience\r\ntested in trial. Know that I am one of those that left heaven for love of\r\nman. We were of that subtle element which is flame, burning and glowing\r\nwith love,--and when thy mother came to me with the power of purity to\r\ncast me out of the furnace, I lost my shape of fire and took that of a\r\nhuman being,--a child. I have been with thee often, and was rushing to\r\nannihilation, because I could not withstand the ordeal of the senses. Had\r\nI yielded, or found thee other than thou art, I should have become again\r\nan earth spirit. I have been led away by wish for power, such as I have\r\nin my grasp, and forgot the mission to the suffering. I became a wanderer\r\nover the earth until I reached this land, the land that you call new.\r\nHere was to be my last trial and here I am to pass the gate of fire.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke voices arose from the settlement.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming,\" said he. The stout form of Hugo was in advance. With a\r\nfierce oath he sprang on the young man. \"He has ruined my household,\" he\r\ncried. \"Fling him into the furnace!\" The young man stood waiting, but his\r\nbrow was serene. He was seized, and in a few moments had disappeared\r\nthrough the mouth of the burning pit. But Mary, looking up, saw a shape\r\nin robes of silvery light, and it drifted upward until it vanished in the\r\ndarkness. The look of horror on her face died away, and a peace came to\r\nit that endured until the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF CROTON\r\n\r\nBetween the island of Manhattoes and the Catskills the Hudson shores were\r\nplagued with spooks, and even as late as the nineteenth century Hans\r\nAnderson, a man who tilled a farm back of Peekskill, was worried into his\r\ngrave by the leaden-face likeness of a British spy whom he had hanged on\r\nGeneral Putnam's orders. \"Old Put\" doubtless enjoyed immunity from this\r\nvexatious creature, because he was born with few nerves. A region\r\nespecially afflicted was the confluence of the Croton and the Hudson, for\r\nthe Kitchawan burying-ground was here, and the red people being disturbed\r\nby the tramping of white men over their graves, \"the walking sachems of\r\nTeller's Point\" were nightly to be met on their errands of protest.\r\n\r\nThese Indians had built a palisade on Croton Point, and here they made\r\ntheir last stand against their enemies from the north. Throughout the\r\nfight old chief Croton stood on the wall with arrows showering around\r\nhim, and directed the resistance with the utmost calm. Not until every\r\none of his men was dead and the fort was going up in flame about him did\r\nhe confess defeat. Then standing amid the charring timbers, he used his\r\nlast breath in calling down the curse of the Great Spirit against the\r\nfoe. As the victorious enemy rushed into the enclosure to secure the\r\nscalps of the dead he fell lifeless into the fire, and their jubilant\r\nyell was lost upon his ears. Yet, he could not rest nor bear to leave his\r\nancient home, even after death, and often his form, in musing attitude,\r\nwas seen moving through the woods. When a manor was built on the ruins of\r\nhis fort, he appeared to the master of it, to urge him into the\r\nContinental army, and having seen this behest obeyed and laid a solemn\r\ninjointure to keep the freedom of the land forever, he vanished, and\r\nnever appeared again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETREAT FROM MAHOPAC\r\n\r\nAfter the English had secured the city of New Amsterdam and had begun to\r\nextend their settlements along the Hudson, the Indians congregated in\r\nlarge numbers about Lake Mahopac, and rejected all overtures for the\r\npurchase of that region. In their resolution they were sustained by their\r\nyoung chief Omoyao, who refused to abandon on on any terms the country\r\nwhere his fathers had solong hunted, fished, and built their lodges. A\r\nhalf-breed, one Joliper, a member of this tribe, was secretly in the pay\r\nof the English, but the allurements and insinuations that he put forth on\r\ntheir behalf were as futile as the breathing of wind in the leaves. At\r\nlast the white men grew angry. Have the land they would, by evil course\r\nif good ways were refused, and commissioning Joliper to act for them in a\r\ndecisive manner, they guaranteed to supply him with forces if his\r\nnegotiations fell through. This man never thought it needful to\r\nnegotiate. He knew the temper of his tribe and he was too jealous of his\r\nchief to go to him for favors, because he loved Maya, the chosen one of\r\nOmoyao.\r\n\r\nAt the door of Maya's tent he entreated her to go with him to the white\r\nsettlements, and on her refusal he broke into angry threats, declaring,\r\nin the self-forgetfulness of passion, that he would kill her lover and\r\nlead the English against the tribe. Unknown to both Omoyao had overheard\r\nthis interview, and he immediately sent runners to tell all warriors of\r\nhis people to meet him at once on the island in the lake. Though the\r\nrunners were cautioned to keep their errand secret, it is probable that\r\nJoliper suspected that the alarm had gone forth, and he resolved to\r\nstrike at once; so he summoned his renegades, stole into camp next\r\nevening and made toward Maya's wigwam, intending to take her to a place\r\nof safety. Seeing the chief at the door, he shot an arrow at him, but the\r\nshaft went wide and slew the girl's father. Realizing, upon this assault,\r\nthat he was outwitted and that his people were outnumbered, the chief\r\ncalled to Maya to meet him at the island, and plunged into the brush,\r\nafter seeing that she had taken flight in an opposite direction. The\r\nvengeful Joliper was close behind him with his renegades, and the chief\r\nwas captured; then, that he might not communicate with his people or\r\ndelay the operations against them, it was resolved to put him to death.\r\n\r\nHe was tied to a tree, the surrounding wood was set on fire, and he was\r\nabandoned to his fate, his enemies leaving him to destruction in their\r\nhaste to reach the place of the council and slay or capture all who were\r\nthere. Hardly were they out of hearing ere the plash of a paddle sounded\r\nthrough the roar of flame and Maya sprang upon the bank, cut her lover's\r\nbonds, and with him made toward the island, which they reached by a\r\nprotected way before the assailants had arrived. They told the story of\r\nJoliper's cruelty and treason, and when his boats were seen coming in to\r\nshore they had eyes and hands only for Joliper. He was the first to land.\r\nHardly had he touched the strand before he was surrounded by a frenzied\r\ncrowd and had fallen bleeding from a hundred gashes.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were overpowered after a brief and bloody resistance. They\r\ntook safety in flight. Omoyao and Maya, climbing upon the rock above\r\ntheir \"council chamber,\" found that while most of their people had\r\nescaped their own retreat was cut off, and that it would be impossible to\r\nreach any of the canoes. They preferred death to torture and captivity,\r\nso, hand in hand, they leaped together down the cliff, and the English\r\nclaimed the land next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIAGARA\r\n\r\nThe cataract of Niagara (properly pronounced Nee-ah-gah-rah), or\r\nOniahgarah, is as fatal as it is fascinating, beautiful, sublime, and the\r\ncasualties occurring there justify the tradition that \"the Thundering\r\nWater asks two victims every year.\" It was reputed, before white men\r\nlooked for the first time on these falls--and what thumping yarns they\r\ntold about them!--that two lives were lost here annually, and this\r\naverage has been kept up by men and women who fall into the flood through\r\naccident, recklessness or despair, while bloody battles have been fought\r\non the shores, and vessels have been hurled over the brink, to be dashed\r\nto splinters on the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the cataract was declared to be the voice of a mighty spirit\r\nthat dwelt in the waters, and in former centuries the Indians offered to\r\nit a yearly sacrifice. This sacrifice was a maiden of the tribe, who was\r\nsent over in a white canoe, decorated with fruit and flowers, and the\r\ngirls contended for this honor, for the brides of Manitou were objects of\r\na special grace in the happy hunting-grounds. The last recorded sacrifice\r\nwas in 1679, when Lelawala, the daughter of chief Eagle Eye, was chosen,\r\nin spite of the urgings and protests of the chevalier La Salle, who had\r\nbeen trying to restrain the people from their idolatries by an exposition\r\nof the Christian dogma. To his protests he received the unexpected\r\nanswer, \"Your words witness against you. Christ, you say, set us an\r\nexample. We will follow it. Why should one death be great, while our\r\nsacrifice is horrible?\" So the tribe gathered at the bank to watch the\r\nsailing of the white canoe. The chief watched the embarkation with the\r\nstoicism usual to the Indian when he is observed by others, but when the\r\nlittle bark swung out into the current his affection mastered him, and he\r\nleaped into his own canoe and tried to overtake his daughter. In a moment\r\nboth were beyond the power of rescue. After their death they were changed\r\ninto spirits of pure strength and goodness, and live in a crystal heaven\r\nso far beneath the fall that its roaring is a music to them: she, the\r\nmaid of the mist; he, the ruler of the cataract. Another version of the\r\nlegend makes a lover and his mistress the chief actors. Some years later\r\na patriarch of the tribe and all his sons went over the fall when the\r\nwhite men had seized their lands, preferring death to flight or war.\r\n\r\nIn about the year 200 the Stone Giants waded across the river below the\r\nfalls on their northward march. These beings were descended from an\r\nancient family, and being separated from their stock in the year 150 by\r\nthe breaking of a vine bridge across the Mississippi, they left that\r\nregion. Indian Pass, in the Adirondacks, bore the names of Otneyarheh,\r\nStony Giants; Ganosgwah, Giants Clothed in Stone; and Dayohjegago, Place\r\nWhere the Storm Clouds Fight the Great Serpent. Giants and serpents were\r\nheld to be harmful inventions of the Evil Spirit, and the Lightning god,\r\ncatching up clouds as he stood on the crags, broke them open, tore their\r\nlightnings out and hurled them against the monsters. These cannibals had\r\nalmost exterminated the Iroquois, for they were of immense size and had\r\nmade themselves almost invincible by rolling daily in the sand until\r\ntheir flesh was like stone. The Holder of the Heavens, viewing their evil\r\nactions from on high, came down disguised as one of their number--he used\r\noften to meditate on Manitou Rock, at the Whirlpool--and leading them to\r\na valley near Onondaga, on pretence of guiding them to a fairer country,\r\nhe stood on a hill above them and hurled rocks upon their heads until\r\nall, save one, who fled into the north, were dead. Yet, in the fulness of\r\ntime, new children of the Stone Giants (mail-clad Europeans?) entered the\r\nregion again and were destroyed by the Great Spirit,--oddly enough where\r\nthe famous fraud known as the Cardiff giant was alleged to have been\r\nfound. The Onondagas believed this statue to be one of their ancient\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFORMED OF ZOAR\r\n\r\nThe valley of Zoar, in western New York, is so surrounded by hills that\r\nits discoverers--a religious people, who gave it a name from Scripture\r\nsaid, \"This is Zoar; it is impregnable. From her we will never go.\" And\r\ntruly, for lack of roads, they found it so hard to get out, having got\r\nin, that they did not leave it. Among the early settlers here were people\r\nof a family named Wright, whose house became a sort of inn for the\r\ninfrequent traveller, inasmuch as they were not troubled with piety, and\r\nhad no scruples against the selling of drink and the playing of cards at\r\nlate hours. A peddler passed through the valley on his way to Buffalo and\r\nstopped at the Wright house for a lodging, but before he went to bed he\r\nincautiously showed a number of golden trinkets from his pack and drew a\r\nconsiderable quantity of money out of his pocket when he paid the fee for\r\nhis lodging. Hardly had he fallen asleep before his greedy hosts were in\r\nthe room, searching for his money. Their lack of caution caused him to\r\nawake, and as he found them rifling his pockets and his pack he sprang up\r\nand showed fight.\r\n\r\nA blow sent him to the bottom of the stairs, where his attempt to escape\r\nwas intercepted, and the family closed around him and bound his arms and\r\nlegs. They showed him the money they had taken and asked where he had\r\nconcealed the rest. He vowed that it was all he had. They insisted that\r\nhe had more, and seizing a knife from the table the elder Wright slashed\r\noff one of his toes \"to make him confess.\" No result came from this, and\r\nsix toes were cut off,--three from each foot; then, in disgust, the\r\nunhappy peddler was knocked on the head and flung through a trap-door\r\ninto a shallow cellar. Presently he arose and tried to draw himself out,\r\nbut with hatchet and knife they chopped away his fingers and he fell\r\nback. Even the women shared in this work, and leaned forward to gaze into\r\nthe cellar to see if he might yet be dead. While listening, they heard\r\nthe man invoke the curse of heaven on them: he asked that they should\r\nwear the mark of crime even to the fourth generation, by coming into the\r\nworld deformed and mutilated as he was then. And it was so. The next\r\nchild born in that house had round, hoof-like feet, with only two toes,\r\nand hands that tapered from the wrist into a single long finger. And in\r\ntime there were twenty people so deformed in the valley: The \"crab-clawed\r\nZoarites\" they were called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEHEADS\r\n\r\nThe feeling recently created by an attempt to fasten the stupid names of\r\nFairport or of North Elmira on the village in central New York that, off\r\nand on for fifty years, had been called Horseheads, caused an inquiry as\r\nto how that singular name chanced to be adopted for a settlement. In\r\n1779, when General Sullivan was retiring toward the base of his supplies\r\nafter a destructive campaign against the Indians in Genesee County, he\r\nstopped near this place and rested his troops. The country was then rude,\r\nunbroken, and still beset with enemies, however, and when the march was\r\nresumed it was thought best to gain time over a part of the way by\r\ndescending the Chemung River on rafts.\r\n\r\nAs there were no appliances for building large floats, and the depth of\r\nthe water was not known, the general ordered a destruction of all\r\nimpedimenta that could be got rid of, and commanded that the poor and\r\nsuperfluous horses should be killed. His order was obeyed. As soon as the\r\ntroops had gone, the wolves, that were then abundant, came forth and\r\ndevoured the carcasses of the steeds, so that the clean-picked bones were\r\nstrewn widely over the camp-ground. When the Indians ventured back into\r\nthis region, some of them piled the skulls of the horses into heaps, and\r\nthese curious monuments were found by white settlers who came into the\r\nvalley some years later, and who named their village Horseheads, in\r\ncommemoration of these relics. The Indians were especially loth to leave\r\nthis region, for their tradition was that it had been the land of the\r\nSenecas from immemorial time, the tribe being descended from a couple\r\nthat had a home on a hill near Horseheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKAYUTA AND WANETA\r\n\r\nThe Indians loved our lakes. They had eyes for their beauty, and to them\r\nthey were abodes of gracious spirits. They used to say of Oneida Lake,\r\nthat when the Great Spirit formed the world \"his smile rested on its\r\nwaters and Frenchman's Island rose to greet it; he laughed and Lotus\r\nIsland came up to listen.\" So they built lodges on their shores and\r\nskimmed their waters in canoes. Much of their history relates to them,\r\nand this is a tale of the Senecas that was revived a few years ago by the\r\ndiscovery of a deer-skin near Lakes Waneta and Keuka, New York, on which\r\nsome facts of the history were rudely drawn, for all Indians are artists.\r\n\r\nWaneta, daughter of a chief, had plighted her troth to Kayuta, a hunter\r\nof a neighboring tribe with which her people were at war. Their tryst was\r\nheld at twilight on the farther shore of the lake from her village, and\r\nit was her gayety and happiness, after these meetings had taken place,\r\nthat roused the suspicion and jealousy of Weutha, who had marked her for\r\nhis bride against the time when he should have won her father's consent\r\nby some act of bravery. Shadowing the girl as she stole into the forest\r\none evening, he saw her enter her canoe and row to a densely wooded spot;\r\nhe heard a call like the note of a quail, then an answer; then Kayuta\r\nemerged on the shore, lifted the maiden from her little bark, and the\r\ntwain sat down beside the water to listen to the lap of its waves and\r\nwatch the stars come out.\r\n\r\nHurrying back to camp, the spy reported that an enemy was near them, and\r\nalthough Waneta had regained her wigwam by another route before the\r\ncompany of warriors had reached the lake, Kayuta was seen, pursued, and\r\nonly escaped with difficulty. Next evening, not knowing what had happened\r\nafter her homeward departure on the previous night--for the braves deemed\r\nit best to keep the knowledge of their military operations from the\r\nwomen--the girl crept away to the lake again and rowed to the accustomed\r\nplace, but while waiting for the quail call a twig dropped on the water\r\nbeside her. With a quick instinct that civilization has spoiled she\r\nrealized this to be a warning, and remaining perfectly still, she allowed\r\nher boat to drift toward shore, presently discovering that her lover was\r\nstanding waist-deep in the water. In a whisper he told her that they were\r\nwatched, and bade her row to a dead pine that towered at the foot of the\r\nlake, where he would soon meet her. At that instant an arrow grazed his\r\nside and flew quivering into the canoe.\r\n\r\nPushing the boat on its course and telling her to hasten, Kayuta sprang\r\nashore, sounded the warwhoop, and as Weutha rose into sight he clove his\r\nskull with a tomahawk. Two other braves now leaped forward, but, after a\r\nstruggle, Kayuta left them dead or senseless, too. He would have stayed\r\nto tear their scalps off had he not heard his name uttered in a shriek of\r\nagony from the end of the lake, and, tired and bleeding though he was, he\r\nbounded along its margin like a deer, for the voice that he heard was\r\nWaneta's. He reached the blasted pine, gave one look, and sank to the\r\nearth. Presently other Indians came, who had heard the noise of fighting,\r\nand burst upon him with yells and brandished weapons, but something in\r\nhis look restrained them from a close advance. His eyes were fixed on a\r\nstring of beads that lay on the bottom of the lake, just off shore, and\r\nwhen the meaning of it came to them, the savages thought no more of\r\nkilling, but moaned their grief; for Waneta, in stepping from her canoe\r\nto wade ashore, had been caught and swallowed by a quagmire. All night\r\nand all next day Kayuta sat there like a man of stone. Then, just as the\r\nhour fell when he was used to meet his love, his heart broke, and he\r\njoined her in the spiritland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DROP STAR\r\n\r\nA little maid of three years was missing from her home on the Genesee.\r\nShe had gone to gather water-lilies and did not return. Her mother,\r\nalmost crazed with grief, searched for days, weeks, months, before she\r\ncould resign herself to the thought that her little one--Kayutah, the\r\nDrop Star, the Indians called her--had indeed been drowned. Years went\r\nby. The woman's home was secure against pillage, for it was no longer the\r\none house of a white family in that region, and the Indians had retired\r\nfarther and farther into the wilderness. One day a hunter came to the\r\nwoman and said, \"I have seen old Skenandoh,--the last of his tribe, thank\r\nGod! who bade me say this to you: that the ice is broken, and he knows of\r\na hill of snow where a red berry grows that shall be yours if you will\r\nclaim it.\" When the meaning of this message came upon her the woman\r\nfainted, but on recovering speech she despatched her nephew to the hut of\r\nthe aged chief and passed that night in prayer.\r\n\r\nThe young man set off at sunset, and by hard riding, over dim trails,\r\nwith only stars for light, he came in the gray of dawn to an upright\r\ntimber, colored red and hung with scalps, that had been cut from white\r\nmen's heads at the massacre of Wyoming. The place they still call Painted\r\nPost. Without drawing rein he sped along the hills that hem Lake Seneca,\r\nthen, striking deeper into the wilds, he reached a smaller lake, and\r\nalmost fell from his saddle before a rude tent near the shore. A new\r\ngrave had been dug close by, and he shuddered to think that perhaps he\r\nhad come too late, but a wrinkled Indian stepped forth at that moment and\r\nwaited his word.\r\n\r\n\"I come,\" cried the youth,--\"to see the berry that springs from snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You come in time,\" answered Skenandoh. \"No, 'tis not in that grave. It\r\nis my own child that is buried there. She was as a sister to the one you\r\nseek, and she bade me restore the Drop Star to her mother,--the squaw\r\nthat we know as the New Moon's Light.\"\r\n\r\nStepping into the wigwam, he emerged again, clasping the wrist of a girl\r\nof eighteen, whose robe he tore asunder at the throat, showing the white\r\nbreast, and on it a red birth-mark; then, leading her to the young man,\r\nhe said,--\"And now I must go to the setting sun.\" He slung a pouch about\r\nhim, loaded, not with arms and food, but stones, stepped into his canoe,\r\nand paddled out upon the water, singing as he went a melancholy\r\nchant--his deathsong. On gaining the middle of the lake he swung his\r\ntomahawk and clove the bottom of the frail boat, so that it filled in a\r\nmoment and the chief sank from sight. The young man took his cousin to\r\nher overjoyed mother, helped to win her back to the ways of civilized\r\nlife, and eventually married her. She took her Christian name again, but\r\nleft to the lake on whose banks she had lived so long her Indian name of\r\nDrop Star--Kayutah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHET OF PALMYRA\r\n\r\nIt was at Palmyra, New York, that the principles of Mormonism were first\r\nenunciated by Joseph Smith, who claimed to have found the golden plates\r\nof the Book of Mormon in a hill-side in neighboring Manchester,--the\r\n\"Hill of Cumorah,\"--to which he was led by angels. The plates were\r\nwritten in characters similar to the masonic cabala, and he translated\r\nthem by divine aid, giving to the world the result of his discovery. The\r\nHebrew prophet Mormon was the alleged author of the record, and his son\r\nMoroni buried it. The basis of Mormonism was, however, an unpublished\r\nnovel, called \"The Manuscript Found,\" that was read to Sidney Rigdon\r\n(afterwards a Mormon elder) by its author, a clergyman, and that\r\nformulated a creed for a hypothetical church. Smith had a slight local\r\ncelebrity, for he and his father were operators with the divining-rod,\r\nand when he appropriated this creed a harmless and beneficent one, for\r\npolygamy was a later \"inspiration\" of Brigham Young--and began to preach\r\nit, in 1844, it gained many converts. His arrogation of the presidency of\r\nthe \"Church of Latter Day Saints\" and other rash performances won for him\r\nthe enmity of the Gentiles, who imprisoned and killed him at Carthage,\r\nMissouri, leaving Brigham Young to lead the people across the deserts to\r\nSalt Lake, where they prospered through thrift and industry.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed that in the van of this army, on the march to Utah, was\r\noften seen a venerable man with silver beard, who never spoke, but who\r\nwould point the way whenever the pilgrims were faint or discouraged. When\r\nthey reached the spot where the temple was afterwards built, he struck\r\nhis staff into the earth and vanished.\r\n\r\nAt Hydesville, near Palmyra, spiritualism, as it is commonly called, came\r\ninto being on March 31, 1849, when certain of the departed announced\r\nthemselves by thumping on doors and tables in the house of the Fox\r\nfamily, the survivors of which confessed the fraud nearly forty years\r\nafter. It is of interest to note that the ground whence these new\r\nreligions sprang was peopled by the Onondagas, the sacerdotal class of\r\nthe Algonquin tribe, who have preserved the ancient religious rites of\r\nthat great family until this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VILLAIN'S CREMATION\r\n\r\nBramley's Mountain, near the present village of Bloomfield, New York, on\r\nthe edge of the Catskill group, was the home of a young couple that had\r\nmarried with rejoicing and had taken up the duties and pleasures of\r\nhousekeeping with enthusiasm. To be sure, in those days housekeeping was\r\nnot a thing to be much afraid of, and the servant question had not come\r\nup for discussion. The housewives did the work themselves, and the\r\nhusband had no valets. The domicile of this particular pair was merely a\r\ntent of skins stretched around a frame of poles, and their furniture\r\nconsisted principally of furs strewn over the earth floor; but they loved\r\neach other truly. The girl was thankful to be taken from her home to\r\nlive, because, up to the time of her marriage, she had been persecuted by\r\na morose and ill-looking fellow of her tribe, who laid siege to her\r\naffection with such vehemence that the more he pleaded the greater was\r\nher dislike; and now she hoped that she had seen the last of him. But\r\nthat was not to be. He lurked about the wigwam of the pair, torturing\r\nhimself with the sight of their felicity, and awaiting his chance to\r\nprove his hate. This chance came when the husband had gone to Lake\r\nDelaware to fish, for he rowed after and gave battle in the middle of the\r\npond. Taken by surprise, and being insufficiently armed, the husband was\r\nkilled and his body flung into the water. Then, casting an affectionate\r\nleer at the wife who had watched this act of treachery and malice with\r\nspeechless horror from the mountain-side, he drove his canoe ashore and\r\nset off in pursuit of her. She retreated so slowly as to allow him to\r\nkeep her in sight, and when she entered a cave he pressed forward\r\neagerly, believing that now her escape was impossible; but she had\r\npurposely trapped him there, for she had already explored a tortuous\r\npassage that led to the upper air, and by this she had left the cavern in\r\nsafety while he was groping and calling in the dark. Returning to the\r\nentrance, she loosened, by a jar, a ledge that overhung it, so that the\r\ndoor was almost blocked; then, gathering light wood from the dry trees\r\naround her, she made a fire and hurled the burning sticks into the prison\r\nwhere the wretch was howling, until he was dead in smoke and flame. When\r\nhis yells and curses had been silenced she told a friend what she had\r\ndone, then going back to the lake, she sang her death-song and cast\r\nherself into the water, hoping thus to rejoin her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONSTER MOSQUITOE\r\n\r\nThey have some pretty big mosquitoes in New Jersey and on Long Island,\r\nbut, if report of their ancestry is true, they have degenerated in size\r\nand voracity; for the grandfather of all mosquitoes used to live in the\r\nneighborhood of Fort Onondaga, New York, and sallying out whenever he was\r\nhungry, would eat an Indian or two and pick his teeth with their ribs.\r\nThe red men had no arms that could prevail against it, but at last the\r\nHolder of the Heavens, hearing their cry for aid, came down and attacked\r\nthe insect. Finding that it had met its match, the mosquito flew away so\r\nrapidly that its assailant could hardly keep it in sight. It flew around\r\nthe great lake, then turned eastward again. It sought help vainly of the\r\nwitches that brooded in the sink-holes, or Green Lakes (near Janesville,\r\nNew York), and had reached the salt lake of Onondaga when its pursuer\r\ncame up and killed it, the creature piling the sand into hills in its\r\ndying struggles.\r\n\r\nAs its blood poured upon the earth it became small mosquitoes, that\r\ngathered about the Holder of the Heavens and stung him so sorely that he\r\nhalf repented the service that he had done to men. The Tuscaroras say\r\nthat this was one of two monsters that stood on opposite banks of the\r\nSeneca River and slew all men that passed. Hiawatha killed the other one.\r\nOn their reservation is a stone, marked by the form of the Sky Holder,\r\nthat shows where he rested during the chase, while his tracks were until\r\nlately seen south of Syracuse, alternating with footprints of the\r\nmosquito, which were shaped like those of a bird, and twenty inches long.\r\nAt Brighton, New York, where these marks appeared, they were\r\nreverentially renewed by the Indians for many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN PICTURE\r\n\r\nIn a cellar in Green Street, Schenectady, there appeared, some years ago,\r\nthe silhouette of a human form, painted on the floor in mould. It was\r\nswept and scrubbed away, but presently it was there again, and month by\r\nmonth, after each removal, it returned: a mass of fluffy mould, always in\r\nthe shape of a recumbent man. When it was found that the house stood on\r\nthe site of the old Dutch burial ground, the gossips fitted this and that\r\ntogether and concluded that the mould was planted by a spirit whose\r\nmortal part was put to rest a century and more ago, on the spot covered\r\nby the house, and that the spirit took this way of apprising people that\r\nthey were trespassing on its grave. Others held that foul play had been\r\ndone, and that a corpse, hastily and shallowly buried, was yielding\r\nitself back to the damp cellar in vegetable form, before its resolution\r\ninto simpler elements. But a darker meaning was that it was the outline\r\nof a vampire that vainly strove to leave its grave, and could not because\r\na virtuous spell had been worked about the place.\r\n\r\nA vampire is a dead man who walks about seeking for those whose blood he\r\ncan suck, for only by supplying new life to its cold limbs can he keep\r\nthe privilege of moving about the earth. He fights his way from his\r\ncoffin, and those who meet his gray and stiffened shape, with fishy eyes\r\nand blackened mouth, lurking by open windows, biding his time to steal in\r\nand drink up a human life, fly from him in terror and disgust. In\r\nnorthern Rhode Island those who die of consumption are believed to be\r\nvictims of vampires who work by charm, draining the blood by slow\r\ndraughts as they lie in their graves. To lay this monster he must be\r\ntaken up and burned; at least, his heart must be; and he must be\r\ndisinterred in the daytime when he is asleep and unaware. If he died with\r\nblood in his heart he has this power of nightly resurrection. As late as\r\n1892 the ceremony of heart-burning was performed at Exeter, Rhode Island,\r\nto save the family of a dead woman that was threatened with the same\r\ndisease that removed her, namely, consumption. But the Schenectady\r\nvampire has yielded up all his substance, and the green picture is no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUNS OF CARTHAGE\r\n\r\nAt Carthage, New York, where the Black River bends gracefully about a\r\npoint, there was a stanch old house, built in the colonial fashion and\r\ndesigned for the occupancy of some family of hospitality and wealth, but\r\nthe family died out or moved away, and for some years it remained\r\ndeserted. During the war of 1812 the village gossips were excited by the\r\nappearance of carpenters, painters and upholsterers, and it was evident\r\nthat the place was to be restored to its manorial dignities; but their\r\ncuriosity was deepened instead of satisfied when, after the house had\r\nbeen put in order and high walls built around it, the occupants presented\r\nthemselves as four young women in the garb of nuns. Were they daughters\r\nof the family? Were they English sympathizers in disguise, seeking asylum\r\nin the days of trouble? Had they registered a vow of celibacy until their\r\nlovers should return from the war? Were they on a secret and diplomatic\r\nerrand? None ever knew, at least in Carthage. The nuns lived in great\r\nprivacy, but in a luxury before unequalled in that part of the country.\r\nThey kept a gardener, they received from New York wines and delicacies\r\nthat others could not afford, and when they took the air, still veiled,\r\nit was behind a splendid pair of bays.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, just after the close of the war, a couple of young\r\nAmerican officers went to the convent, and, contrary to all precedent,\r\nwere admitted. They remained within all that day, and no one saw them\r\nleave, but a sound of wheels passed through the street that evening. Next\r\nday there were no signs of life about the place, nor the day following,\r\nnor the next. The savage dog was quiet and the garden walks had gone\r\nunswept. Some neighbors climbed over the wall and reported that the place\r\nhad been deserted. Why and by whom no one ever knew, but a cloud remained\r\nupon its title until a recent day, for it was thought that at some time\r\nthe nuns might return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKULL IN THE WALL\r\n\r\nA skull is built into the wall above the door of the court-house at\r\nGoshen, New York. It was taken from a coffin unearthed in 1842, when the\r\nfoundation of the building was laid. People said there was no doubt about\r\nit, only Claudius Smith could have worn that skull, and he deserved to be\r\npublicly pilloried in that manner. Before the Revolutionary war Smith was\r\na farmer in Monroe, New York, and being prosperous enough to feel the\r\nking's taxes no burden, to say nothing of his jealousy of the advantage\r\nthat an independent government would be to the hopes of his poorer\r\nneighbors, he declared for the king. After the declaration of\r\nindependence had been published, his sympathies were illustrated in an\r\nunpleasantly practical manner by gathering a troop of other Tories about\r\nhim, and, emboldened by the absence of most of the men of his vicinage in\r\nthe colonial army, he began to harass the country as grievously in foray\r\nas the red-coats were doing in open field.\r\n\r\nHe pillaged houses and barns, then burned them; he insulted women, he\r\ndrove away cattle and horses, he killed several persons who had\r\nundertaken to defend their property. His \"campaigns\" were managed with\r\nsuch secrecy that nobody knew when or whence to look for him. His murder\r\nof Major Nathaniel Strong, of Blooming Grove, roused indignation to such\r\na point that a united effort was made to catch him, a money reward for\r\nsuccess acting as a stimulus to the vigilance of the hunters, and at last\r\nhe was captured on Long Island. He was sent back to Goshen, tried,\r\nconvicted, and on January 22, 1779, was hanged, with five of his band.\r\nThe bodies of the culprits were buried in the jail-yard, on the spot\r\nwhere the court-house stands, and old residents identified Smith's\r\nskeleton, when it was accidentally exhumed, by its uncommon size. A\r\nfarmer from an adjacent town made off with a thigh bone, and a mason\r\nclapped mortar into the empty skull and cemented it into the wall, where\r\nit long remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAUNTED MILL\r\n\r\nAmong the settlers in the Adirondacks, forty or fifty years ago, was\r\nHenry Clymer, from Brooklyn, who went up to Little Black Creek and tried\r\nto make a farm out of the gnarly, stumpy land; but being a green hand at\r\nthat sort of thing, he soon gave it up and put up the place near\r\nNorthwood, that is locally referred to as the haunted mill. When the\r\nfirst slab was cut, a big party was on hand to cheer and eat pie in honor\r\nof the Clymers, for Mr. Clymer, who was a dark, hearty, handsome fellow,\r\nand his bright young wife had been liberal in their hospitality. The\r\ncouple had made some talk, they were so loving before folks--too loving\r\nto last; and, besides, it was evident that Mrs. Clymer was used to a\r\nbetter station in life than her husband. It was while the crowd was\r\nlaughing and chattering at the picnic-table of new boards from the mill\r\nthat Mrs. Clymer stole away to her modest little house, and a neighbor\r\nwho had followed her was an accidental witness to a singular episode.\r\nMrs. Clymer was kneeling beside her bed, crying over the picture of a\r\nchild, when Clymer entered unexpectedly and attempted to take the picture\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nShe faced him defiantly. \"You kept that because it looked like him, I\r\nreckon,\" he said. \"You might run back to him. You know what he'd call you\r\nand where you'd stand with your aristocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman pointed to the door, and the man left without another word, and\r\nso did the listener. Next morning the body of Mrs. Clymer was found\r\nhanging to a beam in the mill. At the inquest the husband owned that he\r\nhad \"had a few words\" with her on the previous day, and thought that she\r\nmust have suddenly become insane. The jury took this view. News of the\r\nsuicide was printed in some of the city papers, and soon after that the\r\ngossips had another sensation, for a fair-haired man, also from Brooklyn,\r\narrived at the place and asked where the woman was buried. When he found\r\nthe grave he sat beside it for some time, his head resting on his hand;\r\nthen he inquired for Clymer, but Clymer, deadly pale, had gone into the\r\nwoods as soon as he heard that a stranger had arrived. The new-comer went\r\nto Trenton, where he ordered a gravestone bearing the single word\r\n\"Estella\" to be placed where the woman's body had been interred. Clymer\r\nquickly sold out and disappeared. The mill never prospered, and has long\r\nbeen in a ruinous condition. People of the neighborhood think that the\r\nghost of Mrs. Clymer--was that her name?--still troubles it, and they\r\npass the place with quickened steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD INDIAN FACE\r\n\r\nOn Lower Ausable Pond is a large, ruddy rock showing a huge profile, with\r\nanother, resembling a pappoose, below it. When the Tahawi ruled this\r\nregion their sachem lived here at \"the Dark Cup,\" as they called this\r\nlake, a man renowned for virtue and remarkable, in his age, for\r\ngentleness. When his children had died and his manly grandson, who was\r\nthe old man's hope, had followed them to the land of the cloud mountains,\r\nAdota's heart withered within him, and standing beneath this rock, he\r\naddressed his people, recounting what he had done for them, how he had\r\nswept their enemies from the Lakes of the Clustered Stars (the Lower\r\nSaranac) and Silver Sky (Upper Saranac) to the Lake of Wandah, gaining a\r\nland where they might hunt and fish in peace. The little one, the Star,\r\nhad been ravished away to crown the brow of the thunder god, who, even\r\nnow, was advancing across the peaks, bending the woods and lighting the\r\nvalleys with his jagged torches.\r\n\r\nLife was nothing to him longer; he resigned it.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these words he fell back, and the breath passed out of him.\r\nThen came the thunder god, and with an appalling burst of fire sent the\r\npeople cowering. The roar that followed seemed to shake the earth, but\r\nthe medicine-man of the tribe stood still, listening to the speech of the\r\ngod in the clouds. \"Tribe of the Tahawi,\" he translated, \"Adota treads\r\nthe star-path to the happy hunting-grounds, and the sun is shining on his\r\nheart. He will never walk among you again, but the god loves both him and\r\nyou, and he will set his face on the mountains. Look!\" And, raising their\r\neyes, they beheld the likeness of Adota and of his beloved child, the\r\nStar, graven by lightning-stroke on the cliff. There they buried the body\r\nof Adota and held their solemn festivals until the white men drove them\r\nout of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIVISION OF THE SARANACS\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century a large body of Saranac Indians\r\noccupied the forests of the Upper Saranac through which ran the Indian\r\ncarrying-place, called by them the Eagle Nest Trail. Whenever they raided\r\nthe Tahawi on the slopes of Mount Tahawus (Sky-splitter), there was a\r\npleasing rivalry between two young athletes, called the Wolf and the\r\nEagle, as to which would carry off the more scalps, and the tribe was\r\ndivided in admiration of them. There was one who did not share this\r\nliking: an old sachem, one of the wizards who had escaped when the Great\r\nSpirit locked these workers of evil in the hollow trees that stood beside\r\nthe trail. In their struggles to escape the less fortunate ones thrust\r\ntheir arms through the closing bark, and they are seen there, as withered\r\ntrunks and branches, to this day. Oquarah had not been softened by this\r\nexhibition of danger nor the qualification of mercy that allowed him\r\nstill to exist. Rather he was more bitter when he saw, as he fancied,\r\nthat the tribe thought more of the daring and powerful warriors than it\r\ndid of the bent and malignant-minded counsellor.\r\n\r\nIt was in the moon of green leaves that the two young men set off to hunt\r\nthe moose, and on the next day the Wolf returned alone. He explained that\r\nin the hunt they had been separated; he had called for hours for his\r\nfriend, and had searched so long that he concluded he must have returned\r\nahead of him. But he was not at the camp. Up rose the sachem with visage\r\ndark. \"I hear a forked tongue,\" he cried. \"The Wolf was jealous of the\r\nEagle and his teeth have cut into his heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wolf cannot lie,\" answered the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the Eagle?\" angrily shouted the sachem, clutching his hatchet.\r\n\r\n\"The Wolf has said,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\nThe old sachem advanced upon him, but as he raised his axe to strike, the\r\nwife of the Wolf threw herself before her husband, and the steel sank\r\ninto her brain. The sachem fell an instant later with the Wolf's knife in\r\nhis heart, and instantly the camp was in turmoil. Before the day had\r\npassed it had been broken up, and the people were divided into factions,\r\nfor it was no longer possible to hold it together in peace. The Wolf,\r\nwith half of the people, went down the Sounding River to new\r\nhunting-grounds, and the earth that separated the families was reddened\r\nwhenever one side met the other.\r\n\r\nYears had passed when, one morning, the upper tribe saw a canoe advancing\r\nacross the Lake of the Silver Sky. An old man stepped from it: he was the\r\nEagle. After the Wolf had left him he had fallen into a cleft in a rock,\r\nand had lain helpless until found by hunters who were on their way to\r\nCanada. He had joined the British against the French, had married a\r\nnorthern squaw, but had returned to die among the people of his early\r\nlove. Deep was his sorrow that his friend should have been accused of\r\ndoing him an injury, and that the once happy tribe should have been\r\ndivided by that allegation. The warriors and sachems of both branches\r\nwere summoned to a council, and in his presence they swore a peace, so\r\nthat in the fulness of time he was able to die content. That peace was\r\nalways kept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EVENT IN INDIAN PARK\r\n\r\nIt was during the years when the Saranacs were divided that Howling Wind,\r\none of the young men of Indian Carry, saw and fell in love with a girl of\r\nthe family on Tupper Lake. He quickly found a way to tell his liking, and\r\nthe couple met often in the woods and on the shore. He made bold to row\r\nher around the quieter bays, and one moonlight evening he took her to\r\nDevil's Rock, or Devil's Pulpit, where he told her the story of the\r\nplace. This was to the effect that the fiend had paddled, on timbers, by\r\nmeans of his tail, to that rock, and had assembled fish and game about\r\nhim in large numbers by telling them that he was going to preach to them,\r\ninstead of which moral procedure he pounced upon and ate all that were\r\nwithin his grasp.\r\n\r\nAs so often happened in Indian history, the return of these lovers was\r\nseen by a disappointed rival, who had hurried back to camp and secured\r\nthe aid of half a dozen men to arrest the favored one as soon as he\r\nshould land. The capture was made after a struggle, and Howling Wind was\r\ndragged to the chief's tent for sentence. That sentence was death, and\r\nwith a refinement of cruelty that was rare even among the Indians, the\r\ngirl was ordered to execute it. She begged and wept to no avail. An axe\r\nwas put into her hands, and she was ordered to despatch the prisoner. She\r\ntook the weapon; her face grew stern and the tears dried on her cheeks;\r\nher lover, bound to a tree, gazed at her in amazement; his rival watched,\r\nalmost in glee. Slowly the girl crossed the open space to her lover. She\r\nraised the tomahawk and at a blow severed the thongs that held him, then,\r\nlike a flash, she leaped upon his rival, who had sprung forward to\r\ninterfere, and clove his skull with a single stroke. The lovers fled as\r\nonly those can fly who run for life. Happily for them, they met a party\r\nfrom the Carry coming to rescue Howling Wind from the danger to which his\r\ncourtship had exposed him, and it was even said that this party entered\r\nthe village and by presenting knives and arrows at the breast of the\r\nchief obtained his now superfluous consent to the union of the fugitives.\r\nThe pair reached the Carry in safety and lived a long and happy life\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN PLUME\r\n\r\nBrightest flower that grows beside the brooks is the scarlet blossom of\r\nthe Indian plume: the blood of Lenawee. Hundreds of years ago she lived\r\nhappily among her brother and sister Saranacs beside Stony Creek, the\r\nStream of the Snake, and was soon to marry the comely youth who, for the\r\nspeed of his foot, was called the Arrow. But one summer the Quick Death\r\ncame on the people, and as the viewless devil stalked through the village\r\nyoung and old fell before him. The Arrow was the first to die. In vain\r\nthe Prophet smoked the Great Calumet: its smoke ascending took no shape\r\nthat he could read. In vain was the white dog killed to take aloft the\r\npeople's sins. But at last the Great Spirit himself came down to the\r\nmountain called the Storm Darer, splendid in lightning, awful in his\r\nthunder voice and robe of cloud. \"My wrath is against you for your sins,\"\r\nhe cried, \"and naught but human blood will appease it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Prophet told his message, and all sat silent for a\r\ntime. Then Lenawee entered the circle. \"Lenawee is a blighted flower,\"\r\nshe sobbed. \"Let her blood flow for her people.\" And catching a knife\r\nfrom the Prophet's belt, she ran with it to the stream on which she and\r\nthe Arrow had so often floated in their canoe. In another moment her\r\nblood had bedewed the earth. \"Lay me with the Arrow,\" she murmured, and,\r\nsmiling in their sad faces, breathed her last. The demon of the quick\r\ndeath shrank from the spot, and the Great Spirit smiled once more on the\r\ntribe that could produce such heroism. Lenawee's body was placed beside\r\nher lover's, and next morning, where her blood had spilt, the ground was\r\npure, and on it grew in slender spires a new flower,--the Indian plume:\r\nthe transformed blood of sacrifice. The people loved that flower in all\r\nyears after. They decked their hair and dresses with it and made a feast\r\nin its honor. When parents taught their children the beauty of\r\nunselfishness they used as its emblem a stalk of Indian plume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRTH OF THE WATER-LILY\r\n\r\nBack from his war against the Tahawi comes the Sun, chief of the Lower\r\nSaranacs,--back to the Lake of the Clustered Stars, afterward called, by\r\ndullards, Tupper's Lake. Tall and invincible he comes among his people,\r\nboasting of his victories, Indian fashion, and stirring the scalps that\r\nhang at his breast. \"The Eagle screams,\" he cries. \"He greets the chief,\r\nthe Blazing Sun. Wayotah has made the Tahawi tremble. They fly from him.\r\nHooh, hooh! He is the chief.\" Standing apart with wistful glance stands\r\nOseetah, the Bird. She loves the strong young chief, but she knows that\r\nanother has his promise, and she dares not hope; yet the chief loves her,\r\nand when the feasting is over he follows her footprints to the shore,\r\nwhere he sees her canoe turning the point of an island. He silently\r\npursues and comes upon her as she sits waving and moaning. He tries to\r\nembrace her, but she draws apart. He asks her to sing to him; she bids\r\nhim begone.\r\n\r\nHe takes a more imperious tone and orders her to listen to her chief. She\r\nmoves away. He darts toward her. Turning on him a face of sorrow, she\r\nruns to the edge of a steep rock and waves him back. He hastens after.\r\nThen she springs and disappears in the deep water. The Sun plunges after\r\nher and swims with mad strength here and there. He calls. There is no\r\nanswer. Slowly he returns to the village and tells the people what has\r\nhappened. The Bird's parents are stricken and the Sun moans in his sleep.\r\nAt noon a hunter comes in with strange tidings: flowers are growing on\r\nthe water! The people go to their canoes and row to the Island of Elms.\r\nThere, in a cove, the still water is enamelled with flowers, some as\r\nwhite as snow, filling the air with perfume, others strong and yellow,\r\nlike the lake at sunset.\r\n\r\n\"Explain to us,\" they cry, turning to the old Medicine of his tribe, \"for\r\nthis was not so yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is our daughter,\" he answered. \"These flowers are the form she\r\ntakes. The white is her purity, the yellow her love. You shall see that\r\nher heart will close when the sun sets, and will reopen at his coming.\"\r\nAnd the young chief went apart and bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS'S SLIDE\r\n\r\nThe shores of Lakes George and Champlain were ravaged by war. Up and down\r\nthose lovely waters swept the barges of French and English, and the green\r\nhills rang to the shrill of bugles, the boom of cannon, and the yell of\r\nsavages. Fiction and history have been weft across the woods and the\r\nmemory of deeds still echoes among the heights. It was at Glen's Falls,\r\nin the cave on the rock in the middle of the river, that the brave Uncas\r\nheld the watch with Hawkeye. Bloody Defile and Bloody Pond, between there\r\nand Lake George, take their names from the \"Bloody morning scout\" sent\r\nout by Sir William Johnson on a September day in 1755 to check Dieskau\r\nuntil Fort William Henry could be completed. In the action that ensued,\r\nColonel Williams, founder of Williams College, and Captain Grant, of the\r\nConnecticut line, great-grandfather of the President who bore that name,\r\nwere killed. The victims, dead and wounded alike, having been flung into\r\nBloody Pond, it was thick and red for days, and tradition said that in\r\nafter years it resumed its hue of crimson at sunset and held it until\r\ndawn. The captured, who were delivered to the Indians, had little to\r\nhope, for their white allies could not stay their savagery. Blind Rock\r\nwas so called because the Indians brought a white man there, and tearing\r\nhis eyes out, flung them into embers at the foot of the stone. Captives\r\nwere habitually tortured, blazing splinters of pine being thrust into\r\ntheir flesh, their nails torn out, and their bodies slashed with knives\r\nbefore they went to the stake. An English prisoner was allowed to run the\r\ngauntlet here. They had already begun to strike at him as he sped between\r\nthe lines, when he seized a pappoose, flung it on a fire, and, in the\r\ninstant of confusion that followed, snatched an axe, cut the bonds of a\r\ncomrade who had been doomed to die, and both escaped.\r\n\r\nBut the best-known history of this region is that of Rogers's Rock, or\r\nRogers's Slide, a lofty precipice at the lower end of Lake George. Major\r\nRogers did not toboggan down this rock in leather trousers, but his\r\nescape was no less remarkable than if he had. On March 13, 1758, while\r\nreconnoitring near Ticonderoga with two hundred rangers, he was surprised\r\nby a force of French and Indians. But seventeen of his men escaped death\r\nor capture, and he was pursued nearly to the brink of this cliff. During\r\na brief delay among the red men, arising from the loss of his trail, he\r\nhad time to throw his pack down the slide, reverse his snow-shoes, and go\r\nback over his own track to the head of a ravine before they emerged from\r\nthe woods, and, seeing that his shoe-marks led to the rock, while none\r\npointed back, they concluded that he had flung himself off and committed\r\nsuicide to avoid capture. Great was their disappointment when they saw\r\nthe major on the frozen surface of the lake beneath going at a lively\r\nrate toward Fort William Henry. He had gained the ice by way of the cleft\r\nin the rocks, but the savages, believing that he had leaped over the\r\nprecipice, attributed his preservation to the Great Spirit and forbore to\r\nfire on him. Unconsciously, he had chosen the best possible place to\r\ndisappear from, for the Indians held it in superstitious regard,\r\nbelieving that spirits haunted the wood and hurled bad souls down the\r\ncliff, drowning them in the lake, instead of allowing them to go to the\r\nhappy hunting grounds. The major reached his quarters in safety, and\r\nlived to take up arms against the land of his birth when the colonies\r\nrevolted, seventeen years later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALLS AT COHOES\r\n\r\nWhen Occuna, a young Seneca, fell in love with a girl whose cabin was\r\nnear the present town of Cohoes, he behaved very much as Americans of a\r\nlater date have done. He picked wild flowers for her; he played on the\r\nbone pipe and sang sentimental songs in the twilight; he roamed the hills\r\nwith her, gathering the loose quartz crystals that the Indians believed\r\nto be the tears of stricken deer, save on Diamond Rock, in Lansingburgh,\r\nwhere they are the tears of Moneta, a bereaved mother and wife; and in\r\nfine weather they went boating on the Mohawk above the rapids. They liked\r\nto drift idly on the current, because it gave them time to gaze into each\r\nother's eyes, and to build air castles that they would live in in the\r\nfuture. They were suddenly called to a realization of danger one evening,\r\nfor the stream had been subtly drawing them on and on until it had them\r\nin its power. The stroke of the paddle failed and the air castles fell in\r\ndismal ruin. Sitting erect they began their death-song in this wise:\r\n\r\nOccuna: \"Daughter of a mighty warrior, the Manitou calls me hence. I hear\r\nthe roaring of his voice; I see the lightning of his glance along the\r\nriver; he walks in clouds and spray upon the waters.\"\r\n\r\nThe Maiden: \"Thou art thyself a warrior, O Occuna. Hath not thine axe\r\nbeen often bathed in blood? Hath the deer ever escaped thine arrow or the\r\nbeaver avoided thy chase? Thou wilt not fear to go into the presence of\r\nManitou.\"\r\n\r\nOccuna: \"Manitou, indeed, respects the strong. When I chose thee from the\r\nwomen of our tribe I promised that we should live and die together. The\r\nThunderer calls us now. Welcome, O ghost of Oriska, chief of the\r\ninvincible Senecas! A warrior and the daughter of a warrior come to join\r\nyou in the feast of the blessed!\"\r\n\r\nThe boat leaped over the falls, and Occuna, striking on the rocks below,\r\nwas killed at once; but, as by a miracle, the girl fell clear of them and\r\nwas whirled on the seething current to shoal water, where she made her\r\nescape. For his strength and his virtues the dead man was canonized. His\r\ntribe raised him above the regions of the moon, whence he looked down on\r\nthe scenes of his youth with pleasure, and in times of war gave pleasant\r\ndreams and promises to his friends, while he confused the enemy with evil\r\nomens. Whenever his tribe passed the falls they halted and with brief\r\nceremonials commemorated the death of Occuna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS WOOLCOTT'S NIGHT-RIDERS\r\n\r\nIn Copake, New York, among the Berkshire Hills, less than a century ago,\r\nlived Francis Woolcott, a dark, tall man, with protruding teeth, whose\r\nsinister laugh used to give his neighbors a creep along their spines. He\r\nhad no obvious trade or calling, but the farmers feared him so that he\r\nhad no trouble in making levies: pork, flour, meal, cider, he could have\r\nwhat he chose for the asking, for had he not halted horses at the plow so\r\nthat neither blows nor commands could move them for two hours? Had he not\r\nset farmer Raught's pigs to walking on their hind legs and trying to\r\ntalk? When he shouted \"Hup! hup! hup!\" to farmer Williams's children, had\r\nthey not leaped to the moulding of the parlor wainscot,--a yard above the\r\nfloor and only an inch wide,--and walked around it, afterward skipping\r\nlike birds from chair-back to chair-back, while the furniture stood as if\r\nnailed to the floor? And was he not the chief of thirteen night-riders,\r\nwhose faces no man had seen, nor wanted to see, and whom he sent about\r\nthe country on errands of mischief every night when the moon was growing\r\nold? As to moons, had he not found a mystic message from our satellite on\r\nMount Riga, graven on a meteor?\r\n\r\nHorses' tails were tied, hogs foamed at the mouth and walked like men,\r\ncows gave blood for milk. These night-riders met Woolcott in a grove of\r\nash and chestnut trees, each furnished with a stolen bundle of oat straw,\r\nand these bundles Woolcott changed to black horses when the night had\r\ngrown dark enough not to let the way of the change be seen. These horses\r\ncould not cross streams of water, and on the stroke of midnight they fell\r\nto pieces and were oaten sheaves once more, but during their time of\r\naction they rushed through woods, bearing their riders safely, and tore\r\nlike hurricanes across the fields, leaping bushes, fences, even trees,\r\nwithout effort. Never could traces be found of them the next day. At last\r\nthe devil came to claim his own. Woolcott, who was ninety years old, lay\r\nsick and helpless in his cabin. Clergymen refused to see him, but two or\r\nthree of his neighbors stifled their fears and went to the wizard's house\r\nto soothe his dying moments. With the night came storm, and with its\r\noutbreak the old man's face took on such a strange and horrible look that\r\nthe watchers fell back in alarm. There was a burst of purple flame at the\r\nwindow, a frightful peal, a smell of sulphur, and Woolcott was dead. When\r\nthe watchers went out the roads were dry, and none in the village had\r\nheard wind, rain, or thunder. It was the coming of the fiend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLY'S LOVER\r\n\r\nIn about the middle of this century a withered woman of ninety was buried\r\nfrom a now deserted house in White Plains, New York, Polly Carter the\r\nname of her, but \"Crazy Polly\" was what the neighbors called her, for she\r\nwas eccentric and not fond of company. Among the belongings of her house\r\nwas a tall clock, such as relic hunters prize, that ticked solemnly in a\r\nlanding on the stairs.\r\n\r\nFor a time, during the Revolution, the house stood within the British\r\nlines, and as her father was a colonel in Washington's army she was left\r\nalmost alone in it. The British officers respected her sex, but they had\r\nan unpleasant way of running in unannounced and demanding entertainment,\r\nin the king's name, which she felt forced to grant. One rainy afternoon\r\nthe door was flung open, then locked on the inside, and she found herself\r\nin the arms of a stalwart, handsome lieutenant, who wore the blue. It was\r\nher cousin and fiance. Their glad talk had not been going long when there\r\ncame a rousing summons at the door. Three English officers were awaiting\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they had seen Lawrence Carter go into the house, and if caught he\r\nwould be killed as a spy. He must be hidden, but in some place where they\r\nwould not think of looking. The clock! That was the place. With a laugh\r\nand a kiss the young man submitted to be shut in this narrow quarter, and\r\nthrowing his coat and hat behind some furniture the girl admitted the\r\nofficers, who were wet and surly and demanded dinner. They tramped about\r\nthe best room in their muddy boots, talking loudly, and in order to break\r\nthe effect of the chill weather they passed the brandy bottle freely.\r\nPolly served them with a dinner as quickly as possible, for she wanted to\r\nget them out of the house, but they were in no mood to go, and the bottle\r\npassed so often that before the dinner was over they were noisy and tipsy\r\nand were using language that drove Polly from the room.\r\n\r\nAt last, to her relief, she heard them preparing to leave the house, but\r\nas they were about to go the senior officer, looking up at the landing,\r\nnow dim in the paling light, said to one of the others, \"See what time it\r\nis.\" The officer addressed, who happened to be the drunkest of the party,\r\nstaggered up the stair and exclaimed, \"The d---d thing's stopped.\" Then,\r\nas if he thought it a good joke, he added, \"It'll never go again.\"\r\nDrawing his sabre he gave the clock a careless cut and ran the blade\r\nthrough the panel of the door; after this the three passed out. When\r\ntheir voices had died in distant brawling, Polly ran to release her\r\nlover. Something thick and dark was creeping from beneath the clock-case.\r\nWith trembling fingers she pulled open the door, and Lawrence, her lover,\r\nfell heavily forward into her arms, dead. The officer was right: the\r\nclock never went again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSBY, THE PATRIOT SPY\r\n\r\nIt was at the Jay house, in Westchester, New York, that Enoch Crosby met\r\nWashington and offered his services to the patriot army. Crosby was a\r\ncobbler, and not a very thriving one, but after the outbreak of\r\nhostilities he took a peddler's outfit on his back and, as a\r\nnon-combatant, of Tory sympathies, he obtained admission through the\r\nBritish lines. After his first visit to head quarters it is certain that\r\nhe always carried Sir Henry Clinton's passport in the middle of his pack,\r\nand so sure were his neighbors that he was in the service of the British\r\nthat they captured him and took him to General Washington, but while his\r\ncase was up for debate he managed to slip his handcuffs, which were not\r\nsecure, and made off. Clinton, on the other hand, was puzzled by the\r\nunaccountable foresight of the Americans, for every blow that he prepared\r\nto strike was met, and he lost time and chance and temper. As if the\r\nsuspicion of both armies and the hatred of his neighbors were not enough\r\nto contend against, Crosby now became an object of interest to the\r\nSkinners and Cowboys, who were convinced that he was making money,\r\nsomehow, and resolved to have it.\r\n\r\nThe Skinners were camp-followers of the American troops and the Cowboys a\r\nband of Tories and renegade British. Both factions were employed,\r\nostensibly, in foraging for their respective armies, but, in reality, for\r\nthemselves, and the farmers and citizens occupying the neutral belt north\r\nof Manhattan Island had reason to curse them both impartially. While\r\nthese fellows were daring thieves, they occasionally got the worst of it,\r\neven in the encounters with the farmers, as on the Neperan, near\r\nTarrytown, where the Cowboys chased a woman to death, but were afterward\r\ncut to pieces by the enraged neighbors. Hers is but one of the many\r\nghosts that haunt the neutral ground, and the croaking of the birds of\r\nill luck that nest at Raven rock is blended with the cries of her dim\r\nfigure. Still, graceless as these fellows were, they affected a loyalty\r\nto their respective sides, and were usually willing to fight each other\r\nwhen they met, especially for the plunder that was to be got by fighting.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1780, Claudius Smith, \"king of the Cowboys,\" and three\r\nscalawag sons came to the conclusion that it was time for Crosby's money\r\nto revert to the crown, and they set off toward his little house one\r\nevening, sure of finding him in, for his father was seriously ill. The\r\nSmiths arrived there to find that the Skinners had preceded them on the\r\nsame errand, and they recognized through the windows, in the leader of\r\nthe band, a noted brigand on whose head a price was laid. He was\r\nsearching every crack and cranny of the room, while Crosby, stripped to\r\nshirt and trousers, stood before the empty fireplace and begged for that\r\nnight to be left alone with his dying father.\r\n\r\n\"To hell with the old man!\" roared the Skinner. \"Give up your gold, or\r\nwe'll put you to the torture,\" and he significantly whirled the end of a\r\nrope that he carried about his waist. At that moment the faint voice of\r\nthe old man was heard calling from another room.\r\n\r\n\"Take all that I have and let me go!\" cried Crosby, and turning up a\r\nbrick in the fire-place he disclosed a handful of gold, his life savings.\r\nThe leader still tried to oppose his exit, but Crosby flung him to the\r\nfloor and rushed away to his father, while the brigand, deeming it well\r\nto delay rising, dug his fingers into the hollow and began to extract the\r\nsovereigns. At that instant four muskets were discharged from without:\r\nthere was a crash of glass, a yell of pain, and four of the Skinners\r\nrolled bleeding on the floor; two others ran into the darkness and\r\nescaped; their leader, trying to follow, was met at the threshold by the\r\nSmiths, who clutched the gold out of his hand and pinioned his elbows in\r\na twinkling.\r\n\r\n\"I thought ye'd like to know who's got ye,\" said old Smith, peering into\r\nthe face of the astonished and crestfallen robber, \"for I've told ye many\r\na time to keep out of my way, and now ye've got to swing for getting into\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nWithin five minutes of the time that he had got his clutch on Crosby's\r\nmoney the bandit was choking to death at the end of his own rope, hung\r\nfrom the limb of an apple-tree, and, having secured the gold, the Cowboys\r\nwent their way into the darkness. Crosby soon made his appearance in the\r\nranks of the Continentals, and, though they looked askant at him for a\r\ntime, they soon discovered the truth and hailed him as a hero, for the\r\ninformation he had carried to Washington from Clinton's camp had often\r\nsaved them from disaster. He had survived attack in his own house through\r\nthe falling out of rogues, and he survived the work and hazard of war\r\nthrough luck and a sturdy frame. Congress afterwards gave him a sum of\r\nmoney larger than had been taken from him, for his chief had commended\r\nhim in these lines: \"Circumstances of political importance, which\r\ninvolved the lives and fortunes of many, have hitherto kept secret what\r\nthis paper now reveals. Enoch Crosby has for years been a faithful and\r\nunrequited servant of his country. Though man does not, God may reward\r\nhim for his conduct. GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\nAssociated with Crosby in his work of getting information from the enemy\r\nwas a man named Gainos, who kept an inn on the neutral ground, that was\r\noften raided. Being assailed by Cowboys once, Gainos, with his tenant and\r\nstable-boys, fired at the bandits together, just as the latter had forced\r\nhis front door, then stepping quickly forward he slashed off the head of\r\nthe leader with a cutlass. The retreating crew dumped the body into a\r\nwell on the premises, and there it sits on the crumbling curb o' nights\r\nlooking disconsolately for its head.\r\n\r\nIt may also be mentioned that the Skinners had a chance to revenge\r\nthemselves on the Cowboys for their defeat at the Crosby house. They fell\r\nupon the latter at the tent-shaped cave in Yonkers,--it is called\r\nWashington's Cave, because the general napped there on bivouac,--and not\r\nonly routed them, but secured so much of their treasure that they were\r\nable to be honest for several years after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST GRAVE OF PAINE\r\n\r\nFailure to mark the resting-places of great men and to indicate the\r\nscenes of their deeds has led to misunderstanding and confusion among\r\nthose who discover a regard for history and tradition in this practical\r\nage. Robert Fulton, who made steam navigation possible, lies in an\r\nunmarked tomb in the yard of Trinity Church--the richest church in\r\nAmerica. The stone erected to show where Andre was hanged was destroyed\r\nby a cheap patriot, who thought it represented a compliment to the spy.\r\nThe spot where Alexander Hamilton was shot in the duel by Aaron Burr is\r\nknown to few and will soon be forgotten. It was not until a century of\r\nobloquy had been heaped on the memory of Thomas Paine that his once\r\nenemies were brought to know him as a statesman of integrity, a\r\nphilanthropist, and philosopher. His deistic religion, proclaimed in \"The\r\nAge of Reason,\" is unfortunately no whit more independent than is\r\npreached in dozens of pulpits to-day. He died ripe in honors, despite his\r\nwant of creed, and his mortal part was buried in New Rochelle, New York,\r\nunder a large walnut-tree in a hay-field. Some years later his friends\r\nremoved the body to a new grave in higher ground, and placed over it a\r\nmonument that the opponents of his principles quickly hacked to pieces.\r\nAround the original grave there still remains a part of the old\r\ninclosure, and it was proposed to erect a suitable memorial--the Hudson\r\nand its Hills the spot, but the owner of the tract would neither give nor\r\nsell an inch of his land for the purpose of doing honor to the man. Some\r\ndoubt has already been expressed as to whether the grave is beneath the\r\nmonument or in the inclosure; and it is also asserted that Paine's ghost\r\nappears at intervals, hovering in the air between the two burial-places,\r\nor flitting back and forth from one to the other, lamenting the\r\nforgetfulness of men and wailing, \"Where is my grave? I have lost my\r\ngrave!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISING OF GOUVERNEUR MORRIS\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris, American minister to the court of Louis XVI, was\r\nconsiderably enriched, at the close of the reign of terror, by plate,\r\njewels, furniture, paintings, coaches, and so on, left in his charge by\r\nmembers of the French nobility, that they might not be confiscated in the\r\nsack of the city by the _sans culottes_; for so many of the aristocracy\r\nwere killed and so many went into exile or disguised their names, that it\r\nwas impossible to find heirs or owners for these effects. Some of the\r\npeople who found France a good country to be out of came to America,\r\nwhere adventurers had found prosperity and refugees found peace so many\r\ntimes before. Marshal Ney and Bernadotte are alleged to have served in\r\nthe American army during the Revolution, and at Hogansburg, New York, the\r\nReverend Eleazer Williams, an Episcopal missionary, who lies buried in\r\nthe church-yard there, was declared to be the missing son of Louis XVI.\r\nThe question, \"Have we a Bourbon among us?\" was frequently canvassed; but\r\nhe avoided publicity and went quietly on with his pastoral work.\r\n\r\nAll property left in Mr. Morris's hands that had not been claimed was\r\nremoved to his mansion at Port Morris, when he returned from his\r\nministry, and he gained in the esteem and envy of his neighbors when the\r\nextent of these riches was seen. Once, at the wine, he touched glasses\r\nwith his wife, and said that if she bore a male child that son should be\r\nheir to his wealth. Two relatives who sat at the table exchanged looks at\r\nthis and cast a glance of no gentle regard on his lady. A year went by.\r\nThe son was born, but Gouverneur Morris was dead.\r\n\r\nIt is the first night of the year 1817, the servants are asleep, and the\r\nwidow sits late before the fire, her baby in her arms, listening betimes\r\nto the wind in the chimney, the beat of hail on the shutters, the\r\nbrawling of the Bronx and the clash of moving ice upon it; yet thinking\r\nof her husband and the sinister look his promise had brought to the faces\r\nof his cousins, when a tramp of horses is heard without, and anon a\r\nsummons at the door. The panels are beaten by loaded riding-whips, and a\r\nman's voice cries, \"Anne Morris, fetch us our cousin's will, or we'll\r\nbreak into the house and take it.\" The woman clutches the infant to her\r\nbreast, but makes no answer. Again the clatter of the whips; but now a\r\nmist is gathering in the room, and a strange enchantment comes over her,\r\nfor are not the lions breathing on the coat of arms above the door, and\r\nare not the portraits stirring in their frames?\r\n\r\nThey are, indeed. There is a rustle of robes and clink of steel and one\r\nold warrior leaps down, his armor sounding as he alights, and striking\r\nthrice his sword and shield together he calls on Gouverneur Morris to\r\ncome forth. Somebody moves in the room where Morris died; there is a\r\nmeasured footfall in the corridor, with the clank of a scabbard keeping\r\ntime; the door is opened, and on the blast that enters the widow hears a\r\ncry, then a double gallop, passing swiftly into distance. As she gazes,\r\nher husband appears, apparelled as in life, and with a smile he takes a\r\ncandelabrum from the mantel and, beckoning her to follow, moves from room\r\nto room. Then, for the first time, the widow knows to what wealth her\r\nbaby has been born, for the ghost discloses secret drawers in escritoires\r\nwhere money, title deeds, and gems are hidden, turns pictures and\r\nwainscots on unsuspected hinges, revealing shelves heaped with fabrics,\r\nplate, and lace; then, returning to the fireside, he stoops as if to kiss\r\nhis wife and boy, but a bell strikes the first hour of morning and he\r\nvanishes into his portrait on the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Hudson And Its Hills, by Charles M.

COVENT GARDEN\r\nCAMBRIDGE DEIGHTON BELL & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n1893\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PREFACE\r\n\r\nAlthough the Diary of Samuel Pepys has been in the hands of the public for\r\nnearly seventy years, it has not hitherto appeared in its entirety. In the\r\noriginal edition of 1825 scarcely half of the manuscript was printed.\r\nLord Braybrooke added some passages as the various editions were\r\npublished, but in the preface to his last edition he wrote: \"there\r\nappeared indeed no necessity to amplify or in any way to alter the text of\r\nthe Diary beyond the correction of a few verbal errors and corrupt\r\npassages hitherto overlooked.\"\r\n\r\nThe public knew nothing as to what was left unprinted, and there was\r\ntherefore a general feeling of gratification when it was announced some\r\neighteen years ago that a new edition was to be published by the Rev.\r\nMynors Bright, with the addition of new matter equal to a third of the\r\nwhole.  It was understood that at last the Diary was to appear in its\r\nentirety, but there was a passage in Mr. Bright's preface which suggested\r\na doubt respecting the necessary completeness.  He wrote: \"It would have\r\nbeen tedious to the reader if I had copied from the Diary the account of\r\nhis daily work at the office.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mr. Bright left roughly speaking about one-fifth of\r\nthe whole Diary still unprinted, although he transcribed the whole, and\r\nbequeathed his transcript to Magdalene College.\r\n\r\nIt has now been decided that the whole of the Diary shall be made public,\r\nwith the exception of a few passages which cannot possibly be printed. It\r\nmay be thought by some that these omissions are due to an unnecessary\r\nsqueamishness, but it is not really so, and readers are therefore asked to\r\nhave faith in the judgment of the editor.  Where any passages have been\r\nomitted marks of omission are added, so that in all cases readers will\r\nknow where anything has been left out.\r\n\r\nLord Braybrooke made the remark in his \"Life of Pepys,\" that \"the cipher\r\nemployed by him greatly resembles that known by the name of 'Rich's\r\nsystem.'\"  When Mr. Bright came to decipher the MS., he discovered that\r\nthe shorthand system used by Pepys was an earlier one than Rich's, viz.,\r\nthat of Thomas Shelton, who made his system public in 1620.\r\n\r\nIn his various editions Lord Braybrooke gave a large number of valuable\r\nnotes, in the collection and arrangement of which he was assisted by the\r\nlate Mr. John Holmes of the British Museum, and the late Mr. James\r\nYeowell, sometime sub-editor of \"Notes and Queries.\"  Where these notes\r\nare left unaltered in the present edition the letter \"B.\" has been affixed\r\nto them, but in many instances the notes have been altered and added to\r\nfrom later information, and in these cases no mark is affixed. A large\r\nnumber of additional notes are now supplied, but still much has had to be\r\nleft unexplained.  Many persons are mentioned in the Diary who were little\r\nknown in the outer world, and in some instances it has been impossible to\r\nidentify them.  In other cases, however, it has been possible to throw\r\nlight upon these persons by reference to different portions of the Diary\r\nitself.  I would here ask the kind assistance of any reader who is able to\r\nillustrate passages that have been left unnoted.  I have received much\r\nassistance from the various books in which the Diary is quoted.  Every\r\nwriter on the period covered by the Diary has been pleased to illustrate\r\nhis subject by quotations from Pepys, and from these books it has often\r\nbeen possible to find information which helps to explain difficult\r\npassages in the Diary.\r\n\r\nMuch illustrative matter of value was obtained by Lord Braybrooke from the\r\n\"Diurnall\" of Thomas Rugge, which is preserved in the British Museum (Add.\r\nMSS. 10,116, 10,117).  The following is the description of this\r\ninteresting work as given by Lord Braybrooke\r\n\r\n                    \"MERCURIUS POLITICUS REDIVIVUS;\r\n\r\n  or, A Collection of the most materiall occurrances and transactions\r\n            in Public Affairs since Anno Dni, 1659, untill\r\n                            28 March, 1672,\r\n      serving as an annuall diurnall for future satisfaction and\r\n                             information,\r\n                            BY THOMAS RUGGE.\r\n\r\n             Est natura hominum novitatis avida.--Plinius.\r\n\r\n     \"This MS. belonged, in 1693, to Thomas Grey, second Earl of\r\n     Stamford.  It has his autograph at the commencement, and on the\r\n     sides are his arms (four quarterings) in gold.  In 1819, it was sold\r\n     by auction in London, as part of the collection of Thomas Lloyd,\r\n     Esq.  (No. 1465), and was then bought by Thomas Thorpe, bookseller.\r\n     Whilst Mr. Lloyd was the possessor, the MS. was lent to Dr. Lingard,\r\n     whose note of thanks to Mr. Lloyd is preserved in the volume.  From\r\n     Thorpe it appears to have passed to Mr. Heber, at the sale of whose\r\n     MSS. in Feb.  1836, by Mr. Evans, of Pall Mall, it was purchased by\r\n     the British Museum for L8 8s.\r\n\r\n     \"Thomas Rugge was descended from an ancient Norfolk family, and two\r\n     of his ancestors are described as Aldermen of Norwich.  His death\r\n     has been ascertained to have occurred about 1672; and in the Diary\r\n     for the preceding year he complains that on account of his declining\r\n     health, his entries will be but few.  Nothing has been traced of his\r\n     personal circumstances beyond the fact of his having lived for\r\n     fourteen years in Covent Garden, then a fashionable locality.\"\r\n\r\nAnother work I have found of the greatest value is the late Mr. J. E.\r\nDoyle's \"Official Baronage of England\" (1886), which contains a mass of\r\nvaluable information not easily to be obtained elsewhere.  By reference to\r\nits pages I have been enabled to correct several erroneous dates in\r\nprevious notes caused by a very natural confusion of years in the case of\r\nthe months of January, February, and March, before it was finally fixed\r\nthat the year should commence in January instead of March.  More confusion\r\nhas probably been introduced into history from this than from any other\r\ncause of a like nature.  The reference to two years, as in the case of,\r\nsay, Jan. 5, 1661-62, may appear clumsy, but it is the only safe plan of\r\nnotation.  If one year only is mentioned, the reader is never sure whether\r\nor not the correction has been made.  It is a matter for sincere regret\r\nthat the popular support was withheld from Mr. Doyle's important\r\nundertaking, so that the author's intention of publishing further volumes,\r\ncontaining the Baronies not dealt with in those already published, was\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nMy labours have been much lightened by the kind help which I have\r\nreceived from those interested in the subject.  Lovers of Pepys are\r\nnumerous, and I have found those I have applied to ever willing to give\r\nme such information as they possess.  It is a singular pleasure,\r\ntherefore, to have an opportunity of expressing publicly my thanks to\r\nthese gentlemen, and among them I would especially mention Messrs.\r\nFennell, Danby P. Fry, J. Eliot Hodgkin, Henry Jackson, J. K. Laughton,\r\nJulian Marshall, John Biddulph Martin, J. E. Matthew, Philip Norman,\r\nRichard B. Prosser, and Hugh Callendar, Fellow of Trinity College, who\r\nverified some of the passages in the manuscript.  To the Master and\r\nFellows of Magdalene College, also, I am especially indebted for allowing\r\nme to consult the treasures of the Pepysian Library, and more\r\nparticularly my thanks are due to Mr. Arthur G. Peskett, the Librarian.\r\n\r\n                                        H. B.

Walter Courtenay Pepys\r\n\r\n     [Mr. W.  C.  Pepys has paid great attention to the history of his\r\n     family, and in 1887 he published an interesting work entitled\r\n     \"Genealogy of the Pepys Family, 1273-1887,\" London, George Bell and\r\n     Sons, which contains the fullest pedigrees of the family yet\r\n     issued.]\r\n\r\nsays that the first mention of the name that he has been able to find is\r\nin the Hundred Rolls (Edw. I, 1273), where Richard Pepis and John Pepes\r\nare registered as holding lands in the county of Cambridge.  In the next\r\ncentury the name of William Pepis is found in deeds relating to lands in\r\nthe parish of Cottenham, co.  Cambridge, dated 1329 and 1340 respectively\r\n(Cole MSS., British Museum, vol. i., p. 56; vol.  xlii., p. 44). According\r\nto the Court Roll of the manor of Pelhams, in the parish of Cottenham,\r\nThomas Pepys was \"bayliffe of the Abbot of Crowland in 1434,\" but in spite\r\nof these references, as well as others to persons of the same name at\r\nBraintree, Essex, Depedale, Norfolk, &c., the first ancestor of the\r\nexisting branches of the family from whom Mr. Walter Pepys is able to\r\ntrace an undoubted descent, is \"William Pepis the elder, of Cottenham, co.\r\nCambridge,\" whose will is dated 20th March, 1519.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 a curious manuscript volume, bound in vellum, and entitled \"Liber\r\nTalboti Pepys de instrumentis ad Feoda pertinentibus exemplificatis,\" was\r\ndiscovered in an old chest in the parish church of Bolney, Sussex, by the\r\nvicar, the Rev. John Dale, who delivered it to Henry Pepys, Bishop of\r\nWorcester, and the book is still in the possession of the family.  This\r\nvolume contains various genealogical entries, and among them are\r\nreferences to the Thomas Pepys of 1434 mentioned above, and to the later\r\nWilliam Pepys.  The reference to the latter runs thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"A Noate written out of an ould Booke of my uncle William Pepys.\"\r\n\r\n     \"William Pepys, who died at Cottenham, 10 H. 8, was brought up by\r\n     the Abbat of Crowland, in Huntingdonshire, and he was borne in\r\n     Dunbar, in Scotland, a gentleman, whom the said Abbat did make his\r\n     Bayliffe of all his lands in Cambridgeshire, and placed him in\r\n     Cottenham, which William aforesaid had three sonnes, Thomas, John,\r\n     and William, to whom Margaret was mother naturallie, all of whom\r\n     left issue.\"\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this entry we may refer to the Diary of June 12th,\r\n1667, where it is written that Roger Pepys told Samuel that \"we did\r\ncertainly come out of Scotland with the Abbot of Crowland.\"  The\r\nreferences to various members of the family settled in Cottenham and\r\nelsewhere, at an early date already alluded to, seem to show that there is\r\nlittle foundation for this very positive statement.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the standing of the family, Mr. Walter Pepys writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"The first of the name in 1273 were evidently but small copyholders.\r\n     Within 150 years (1420) three or four of the name had entered the\r\n     priesthood, and others had become connected with the monastery of\r\n     Croyland as bailiffs, &c.  In 250 years (1520) there were certainly\r\n     two families: one at Cottenham, co. Cambridge, and another at\r\n     Braintree, co. Essex, in comfortable circumstances as yeomen\r\n     farmers.  Within fifty years more (1563), one of the family, Thomas,\r\n     of Southcreeke, co. Norfolk, had entered the ranks of the gentry\r\n     sufficiently to have his coat-of-arms recognized by the Herald\r\n     Cooke, who conducted the Visitation of Norfolk in that year.  From\r\n     that date the majority of the family have been in good\r\n     circumstances, with perhaps more than the average of its members\r\n     taking up public positions.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a very general notion that Samuel Pepys was of plebeian birth\r\nbecause his father followed the trade of a tailor, and his own remark,\r\n\"But I believe indeed our family were never considerable,\"--[February\r\n10th, 1661-62.] has been brought forward in corroboration of this view,\r\nbut nothing can possibly be more erroneous, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe Diarist was really proud of his descent.  This may be seen from the\r\ninscription on one of his book-plates, where he is stated to be:--\r\n\r\n     \"Samuel Pepys of Brampton in Huntingdonshire, Esq., Secretary of the\r\n     Admiralty to his Matr. King Charles the Second: Descended from ye\r\n     antient family of Pepys of Cottenham in Cambridgeshire.\"\r\n\r\nMany members of the family have greatly distinguished themselves since the\r\nDiarist's day, and of them Mr. Foss wrote (\"Judges of England,\" vol. vi.,\r\np. 467):--\r\n\r\n     \"In the family of Pepys is illustrated every gradation of legal rank\r\n     from Reader of an Inn of Court to Lord High Chancellor of England.\"\r\n\r\nThe William Pepys of Cottenham who commences the pedigree had three sons\r\nand three daughters; from the eldest son (Thomas) descended the first\r\nNorfolk branch, from the second son (John Pepys of Southcreeke) descended\r\nthe second Norfolk branch, and from the third son (William) descended the\r\nImpington branch.  The latter William had four sons and two daughters; two\r\nof these sons were named Thomas, and as they were both living at the same\r\ntime one was distinguished as \"the black\" and the other as \"the red.\"\r\nThomas the red had four sons and four daughters.  John, born 1601, was the\r\nthird son, and he became the father of Samuel the Diarist. Little is known\r\nof John Pepys, but we learn when the Diary opens that he was settled in\r\nLondon as a tailor.  He does not appear to have been a successful man, and\r\nhis son on August 26th, 1661, found that there was only L45 owing to him,\r\nand that he owed about the same sum.  He was a citizen of London in 1650,\r\nwhen his son Samuel was admitted to Magdalene College, but at an earlier\r\nperiod he appears to have had business relations with Holland.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1661, John Pepys retired to a small property at Brampton (worth\r\nabout L80 per annum), which had been left to him by his eldest brother,\r\nRobert Pepys, where he died in 1680.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of John Pepys's will:\r\n\r\n                            \"MY FATHER'S WILL.\r\n                        [Indorsement by S. Pepys.]\r\n\r\n     \"Memorandum.  That I, John Pepys of Ellington, in the county of\r\n     Huntingdon, Gent.\", doe declare my mind in the disposall of my\r\n     worldly goods as followeth:\r\n\r\n     \"First, I desire that my lands and goods left mee by my brother,\r\n     Robert Pepys, deceased, bee delivered up to my eldest son, Samuell\r\n     Pepys, of London, Esqr., according as is expressed in the last Will\r\n     of my brother Robert aforesaid.\r\n\r\n     \"Secondly, As for what goods I have brought from London, or procured\r\n     since, and what moneys I shall leave behind me or due to me, I\r\n     desire may be disposed of as followeth:\r\n\r\n     \"Imprimis, I give to the stock of the poore of the parish of\r\n     Brampton, in which church I desire to be enterred, five pounds.\r\n\r\n     \"Item.  I give to the Poore of Ellington forty shillings.\r\n\r\n     \"Item.  I desire that my two grandsons, Samuell and John Jackson,\r\n     have ten pounds a piece.\r\n\r\n     \"Item.

I desire that the remainder of what I shall leave be\r\n     equally distributed between my sons Samuel and John Pepys and my\r\n     daughter Paulina Jackson.\r\n\r\n     \"All which I leave to the care of my eldest son Samuel Pepys, to see\r\n     performed, if he shall think fit.\r\n\r\n     \"In witness hereunto I set my hand.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife Margaret, whose maiden name has not been discovered, died on the\r\n25th March, 1667, also at Brampton.  The family of these two consisted of\r\nsix sons and five daughters: John (born 1632, died 1640), Samuel (born\r\n1633, died 1703), Thomas (born 1634, died 1664), Jacob (born 1637, died\r\nyoung), Robert (born 1638, died young), and John (born 1641, died 1677);\r\nMary (born 1627), Paulina (born 1628), Esther (born 1630), Sarah (born\r\n1635; these four girls all died young), and Paulina (born 1640, died\r\n1680), who married John Jackson of Brampton, and had two sons, Samuel and\r\nJohn.  The latter was made his heir by Samuel Pepys.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys was born on the 23rd February, 1632-3, but the place of birth\r\nis not known with certainty.  Samuel Knight, D.D., author of the \"Life of\r\nColet,\" who was a connection of the family (having married Hannah Pepys,\r\ndaughter of Talbot Pepys of Impington), says positively that it was at\r\nBrampton.  His statement cannot be corroborated by the registers of\r\nBrampton church, as these records do not commence until the year 1654.\r\n\r\nSamuel's early youth appears to have been spent pretty equally between\r\ntown and country.  When he and his brother Tom were children they lived\r\nwith a nurse (Goody Lawrence) at Kingsland, and in after life Samuel\r\nrefers to his habit of shooting with bow and arrow in the fields around\r\nthat place.  He then went to school at Huntingdon, from which he was\r\ntransferred to St. Paul's School in London.  He remained at the latter\r\nplace until 1650, early in which year his name was entered as a sizar on\r\nthe boards of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.  He was admitted on the 21st June,\r\nbut subsequently he transferred his allegiance to Magdalene College, where\r\nhe was admitted a sizar on the 1st October of this same year. He did not\r\nenter into residence until March 5th, 1650-51, but in the following month\r\nhe was elected to one of Mr. Spendluffe's scholarships, and two years\r\nlater (October 14th, 1653) he was preferred to one on Dr. John Smith's\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing is known of Pepys's career at college, but soon after\r\nobtaining the Smith scholarship he got into trouble, and, with a\r\ncompanion, was admonished for being drunk.\r\n\r\n     [October 21st, 1653.  \"Memorandum: that Peapys and Hind were\r\n     solemnly admonished by myself and Mr. Hill, for having been\r\n     scandalously over-served with drink ye night before.  This was done\r\n     in the presence of all the Fellows then resident, in Mr. Hill's\r\n     chamber.--JOHN WOOD, Registrar.\"  (From the Registrar's-book of\r\n     Magdalene College.)]\r\n\r\nHis time, however, was not wasted, and there is evidence that he carried\r\ninto his busy life a fair stock of classical learning and a true love of\r\nletters.  Throughout his life he looked back with pleasure to the time he\r\nspent at the University, and his college was remembered in his will when\r\nhe bequeathed his valuable library.  In this same year, 1653, he graduated\r\nB.A.  On the 1st of December, 1655, when he was still without any settled\r\nmeans of support, he married Elizabeth St. Michel, a beautiful and\r\nportionless girl of fifteen.  Her father, Alexander Marchant, Sieur de St.\r\nMichel, was of a good family in Anjou, and son of the High Sheriff of\r\nBauge (in Anjou).  Having turned Huguenot at the age of twenty-one, when\r\nin the German service, his father disinherited him, and he also lost the\r\nreversion of some L20,000 sterling which his uncle, a rich French canon,\r\nintended to bequeath to him before he left the Roman Catholic church.  He\r\ncame over to England in the retinue of Henrietta Maria on her marriage\r\nwith Charles I, but the queen dismissed him on finding that he was a\r\nProtestant and did not attend mass.  Being a handsome man, with courtly\r\nmanners, he found favour in the sight of the widow of an Irish squire\r\n(daughter of Sir Francis Kingsmill), who married him against the wishes of\r\nher family.  After the marriage, Alexander St. Michel and his wife having\r\nraised some fifteen hundred pounds, started, for France in the hope of\r\nrecovering some part of the family property. They were unfortunate in all\r\ntheir movements, and on their journey to France were taken prisoners by\r\nthe Dunkirkers, who stripped them of all their property.  They now settled\r\nat Bideford in Devonshire, and here or near by were born Elizabeth and the\r\nrest of the family.  At a later period St. Michel served against the\r\nSpaniards at the taking of Dunkirk and Arras, and settled at Paris.  He\r\nwas an unfortunate man throughout life, and his son Balthasar says of him:\r\n\"My father at last grew full of whimsies and propositions of perpetual\r\nmotion, &c., to kings, princes and others, which soaked his pocket, and\r\nbrought all our family so low by his not minding anything else, spending\r\nall he had got and getting no other employment to bring in more.\"  While\r\nhe was away from Paris, some \"deluding papists\" and \"pretended devouts\"\r\npersuaded Madame St. Michel to place her daughter in the nunnery of the\r\nUrsulines.  When the father heard of this, he hurried back, and managed to\r\nget Elizabeth out of the nunnery after she had been there twelve days.\r\nThinking that France was a dangerous place to live in, he removed his\r\nfamily to England, where soon afterwards his daughter was married,\r\nalthough, as Lord Braybrooke remarks, we are not told how she became\r\nacquainted with Pepys. St. Michel was greatly pleased that his daughter\r\nhad become the wife of a true Protestant, and she herself said to him,\r\nkissing his eyes: \"Dear father, though in my tender years I was by my low\r\nfortune in this world deluded to popery, by the fond dictates thereof I\r\nhave now (joined with my riper years, which give me some understanding) a\r\nman to my husband too wise and one too religious to the Protestant\r\nreligion to suffer my thoughts to bend that way any more.\"\r\n\r\n     [These particulars are obtained from an interesting letter from\r\n     Balthasar St. Michel to Pepys, dated \"Deal, Feb. 8, 1673-4,\" and\r\n     printed in \"Life, Journals, and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys,\"\r\n     1841, vol. i., pp. 146-53.]\r\n\r\nAlexander St. Michel kept up his character for fecklessness through life,\r\nand took out patents for curing smoking chimneys, purifying water, and\r\nmoulding bricks.  In 1667 he petitioned the king, asserting that he had\r\ndiscovered King Solomon's gold and silver mines, and the Diary of the same\r\ndate contains a curious commentary upon these visions of wealth:--\r\n\r\n     \"March 29, 1667.  4s. a week which his (Balty St. Michel's) father\r\n     receives of the French church is all the subsistence his father and\r\n     mother have, and about; L20 a year maintains them.\"\r\n\r\nAs already noted, Pepys was married on December 1st, 1655.  This date is\r\ngiven on the authority of the Registers of St. Margaret's Church,\r\nWestminster,\r\n\r\n     [The late Mr. T. C. Noble kindly communicated to me a copy of the\r\n     original marriage certificate, which is as follows: \"Samuell Peps\r\n     of this parish Gent. & Elizabeth De Snt. Michell of Martins in the\r\n     fields, Spinster.  Published October 19tn, 22nd, 29th 1655, and\r\n     were married by Richard Sherwin Esqr one of the justices of the\r\n     Peace of the Cittie and Lyberties of Westm.  December 1st.  (Signed)\r\n     Ri. Sherwin.\"]\r\n\r\nbut strangely enough Pepys himself supposed his wedding day to have been\r\nOctober 10th.  Lord Braybrooke remarks on this,\r\n\r\n     \"It is notorious that the registers in those times were very ill\r\n     kept, of which we have here a striking instance .  .  .  .  Surely a\r\n     man who kept a diary could not have made such a blunder.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is even more strange than Pepys's conviction that he was married on\r\nOctober 10th is Mrs. Pepys's agreement with him: On October 10th, 1666, we\r\nread,\r\n\r\n     \"So home to supper, and to bed, it being my wedding night, but how\r\n     many years I cannot tell; but my wife says ten.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Pepys was wrong, as it was eleven years; so she may have been\r\nwrong in the day also.  In spite of the high authority of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPepys on a question so interesting to them both, we must accept the\r\nregister as conclusive on this point until further evidence of its\r\nincorrectness is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Montage (afterwards Earl of Sandwich), who was Pepys's first\r\ncousin one remove (Pepys's grandfather and Montage's mother being brother\r\nand sister), was a true friend to his poor kinsman, and he at once held\r\nout a helping hand to the imprudent couple, allowing them to live in his\r\nhouse.  John Pepys does not appear to have been in sufficiently good\r\ncircumstances to pay for the education of his son, and it seems probable\r\nthat Samuel went to the university under his influential cousin's\r\npatronage.  At all events he owed his success in life primarily to\r\nMontage, to whom he appears to have acted as a sort of agent.\r\n\r\nOn March 26th, 1658, he underwent a successful operation for the stone,\r\nand we find him celebrating each anniversary of this important event of\r\nhis life with thanksgiving.  He went through life with little trouble on\r\nthis score, but when he died at the age of seventy a nest of seven stones\r\nwas found in his left kidney.\r\n\r\n     [\"June 10th, 1669.  I went this evening to London, to carry Mr.\r\n     Pepys to my brother Richard, now exceedingly afflicted with the\r\n     stone, who had been successfully cut, and carried the stone, as big\r\n     as a tennis ball, to show him and encourage his resolution to go\r\n     thro' the operation.\"--Evelyn's Diary.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1659, Pepys accompanied Sir Edward Montage in the \"Naseby,\" when\r\nthe Admiral of the Baltic Fleet and Algernon Sidney went to the Sound as\r\njoint commissioners.  It was then that Montage corresponded with Charles\r\nII., but he had to be very secret in his movements on account of the\r\nsuspicions of Sidney.  Pepys knew nothing of what was going on, as he\r\nconfesses in the Diary:\r\n\r\n     \"I do from this raise an opinion of him, to be one of the most\r\n     secret men in the world, which I was not so convinced of before.\"\r\n\r\nOn Pepys's return to England he obtained an appointment in the office of\r\nMr., afterwards Sir George Downing, who was one of the Four Tellers of the\r\nReceipt of the Exchequer.  He was clerk to Downing when he commenced his\r\ndiary on January 1st, 1660, and then lived in Axe Yard, close by King\r\nStreet, Westminster, a place on the site of which was built Fludyer\r\nStreet.  This, too, was swept away for the Government offices in 1864-65.\r\nHis salary was L50 a year.  Downing invited Pepys to accompany him to\r\nHolland, but he does not appear to have been very pressing, and a few days\r\nlater in this same January he got him appointed one of the Clerks of the\r\nCouncil, but the recipient of the favour does not appear to have been very\r\ngrateful.  A great change was now about to take place in Pepys's fortunes,\r\nfor in the following March he was made secretary to Sir Edward Montage in\r\nhis expedition to bring about the Restoration of Charles II., and on the\r\n23rd he went on board the \"Swiftsure\" with Montage.  On the 30th they\r\ntransferred themselves to the \"Naseby.\"  Owing to this appointment of\r\nPepys we have in the Diary a very full account of the daily movements of\r\nthe fleet until, events having followed their natural course, Montage had\r\nthe honour of bringing Charles II. to Dover, where the King was received\r\nwith great rejoicing.  Several of the ships in the fleet had names which\r\nwere obnoxious to Royalists, and on the 23rd May the King came on board\r\nthe \"Naseby\" and altered there--the \"Naseby\" to the \"Charles,\" the\r\n\"Richard\" to the \"Royal James,\" the \"Speaker\" to the \"Mary,\" the \"Winsby\"\r\nto the \"Happy Return,\" the \"Wakefield\" to the \"Richmond,\" the \"Lambert\" to\r\nthe \"Henrietta,\" the \"Cheriton\" to the \"Speedwell,\" and the \"Bradford\" to\r\nthe \"Success.\"  This portion of the Diary is of particular interest, and\r\nthe various excursions in Holland which the Diarist made are described in\r\na very amusing manner.\r\n\r\nWhen Montagu and Pepys had both returned to London, the former told the\r\nlatter that he had obtained the promise of the office of Clerk of the Acts\r\nfor him.  Many difficulties occurred before Pepys actually secured the\r\nplace, so that at times he was inclined to accept the offers which were\r\nmade to him to give it up.  General Monk was anxious to get the office for\r\nMr. Turner, who was Chief Clerk in the Navy Office, but in the end\r\nMontagu's influence secured it for Pepys.  Then Thomas Barlow, who had\r\nbeen appointed Clerk of the Acts in 1638, turned up, and appeared likely\r\nto become disagreeable.  Pepys bought him off with an annuity of too,\r\nwhich he did not have to pay for any length of time, as Barlow died in\r\nFebruary, 1664-65.  It is not in human nature to be greatly grieved at the\r\ndeath of one to whom you have to pay an annuity, and Pepys expresses his\r\nfeelings in a very naive manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"For which God knows my heart I could be as sorry as is possible for\r\n     one to be for a stranger by whose death he gets L100 per annum, he\r\n     being a worthy honest man; but when I come to consider the\r\n     providence of God by this means unexpectedly to give me L100 a year\r\n     more in my estate, I have cause to bless God, and do it from the\r\n     bottom of my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThis office was one of considerable importance, for not only was the\r\nholder the secretary or registrar of the Navy Board, but he was also one\r\nof the principal officers of the navy, and, as member of the board, of\r\nequal rank with the other commissioners.  This office Pepys held during\r\nthe whole period of the Diary, and we find him constantly fighting for his\r\nposition, as some of the other members wished to reduce his rank merely to\r\nthat of secretary.  In his contention Pepys appears to have been in the\r\nright, and a valuable MS. volume in the Pepysian library contains an\r\nextract from the Old Instructions of about 1649, in which this very point\r\nis argued out.  The volume appears to have been made up by William Penn\r\nthe Quaker, from a collection of manuscripts on the affairs of the navy\r\nfound in his father's, \"Sir William Penn's closet.\" It was presented to\r\nCharles II., with a dedication ending thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"I hope enough to justifie soe much freedome with a Prince that is\r\n     so easie to excuse things well intended as this is\r\n                         \"BY\r\n                              \"Great Prince,\r\n                                   \"Thy faithfull subject,\r\n                                        \"WM. PENN\"\r\n\r\n     \"London, the 22 of the Mo. called June, 1680.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not appear how the volume came into Pepys's possession.  It may\r\nhave been given him by the king, or he may have taken it as a perquisite\r\nof his office.  The book has an index, which was evidently added by Pepys;\r\nin this are these entries, which show his appreciation of the contents of\r\nthe MS.:--\r\n\r\n               \"Clerk of the Acts,\r\n                    his duty,\r\n                    his necessity and usefulness.\"\r\n\r\nThe following description of the duty of the Clerk of the Acts shows the\r\nimportance of the office, and the statement that if the clerk is not\r\nfitted to act as a commissioner he is a blockhead and unfit for his\r\nemployment is particularly racy, and not quite the form of expression one\r\nwould expect to find in an official document:\r\n\r\n                           \"CLERKE OF THE ACTS.\r\n\r\n     \"The clarke of the Navye's duty depends principally upon rateing (by\r\n     the Board's approbation) of all bills and recording of them, and all\r\n     orders, contracts & warrants, making up and casting of accompts,\r\n     framing and writing answers to letters, orders, and commands from\r\n     the Councell, Lord High Admirall, or Commissioners of the Admiralty,\r\n     and he ought to be a very able accomptant, well versed in Navall\r\n     affairs and all inferior officers dutyes.\r\n\r\n     \"It hath been objected by some that the Clarke of the Acts ought to\r\n     be subordinate to the rest of the Commissioners, and not to be\r\n     joyned in equall power with them, although he was so constituted\r\n     from the first institution, which hath been an opinion only of some\r\n     to keep him at a distance, least he might be thought too forward if\r\n     he had joynt power in discovering or argueing against that which\r\n     peradventure private interest would have concealed; it is certaine\r\n     no man sees more of the Navye's Transactions than himselfe, and\r\n     possibly may speak as much to the project if required, or else he is\r\n     a blockhead, and not fitt for that imployment.  But why he should\r\n     not make as able a Commissioner as a Shipp wright lett wise men\r\n     judge.\"\r\n\r\nIn Pepys's patent the salary is stated to be L33 6s. 8d., but this was\r\nonly the ancient \"fee out of the Exchequer,\" which had been attached to\r\nthe office for more than a century.  Pepys's salary had been previously\r\nfixed at L350 a-year.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two qualifications upon which particular stress is laid in\r\nthe above Instructions was possessed by Pepys.  He knew nothing about the\r\nnavy, and so little of accounts that apparently he learned the\r\nmultiplication table for the first time in July, 1661.  We see from the\r\nparticulars given in the Diary how hard he worked to obtain the knowledge\r\nrequired in his office, and in consequence of his assiduity he soon became\r\na model official.  When Pepys became Clerk of the Acts he took up his\r\nresidence at the Navy Office, a large building situated between Crutched\r\nFriars and Seething Lane, with an entrance in each of those places.  On\r\nJuly 4th, 1660, he went with Commissioner Pett to view the houses, and was\r\nvery pleased with them, but he feared that the more influential officers\r\nwould jockey him out of his rights.  His fears were not well grounded, and\r\non July 18th he records the fact that he dined in his own apartments,\r\nwhich were situated in the Seething Lane front.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th, 1660, Pepys was sworn in as Lord Sandwich's deputy for a\r\nClerkship of the Privy Seal.  This office, which he did not think much of\r\nat first, brought him \"in for a time L3 a day.\"  In June, 1660, he was\r\nmade Master of Arts by proxy, and soon afterwards he was sworn in as a\r\njustice of the Peace for Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Hampshire, the\r\ncounties in which the chief dockyards were situated.\r\n\r\nPepys's life is written large in the Diary, and it is not necessary here\r\nto do more than catalogue the chief incidents of it in chronological\r\norder.  In February, 1661-62, he was chosen a Younger Brother of the\r\nTrinity House, and in April, 1662, when on an official visit to Portsmouth\r\nDockyard, he was made a burgess of the town.  In August of the same year\r\nhe was appointed one of the commissioners for the affairs of Tangier.\r\nSoon afterwards Thomas Povy, the treasurer, got his accounts into a\r\nmuddle, and showed himself incompetent for the place, so that Pepys\r\nreplaced him as treasurer to the commission.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1663-64, the Corporation of the Royal Fishery was appointed,\r\nwith the Duke of York as governor, and thirty-two assistants, mostly \"very\r\ngreat persons.\"  Through Lord Sandwich's influence Pepys was made one of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe time was now arriving when Pepys's general ability and devotion to\r\nbusiness brought him prominently into notice.  During the Dutch war the\r\nunreadiness of the ships, more particularly in respect to victualling, was\r\nthe cause of great trouble.  The Clerk of the Acts did his utmost to set\r\nthings right, and he was appointed Surveyor-General of the Victualling\r\nOffice.  The kind way in which Mr. Coventry proposed him as \"the fittest\r\nman in England\" for the office, and the Duke of York's expressed approval,\r\ngreatly pleased him.\r\n\r\nDuring the fearful period when the Plague was raging, Pepys stuck to his\r\nbusiness, and the chief management of naval affairs devolved upon him, for\r\nthe meetings at the Navy Office were but thinly attended.  In a letter to\r\nCoventry he wrote:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sickness in general thickens round us, and particularly upon\r\n     our neighbourhood.  You, sir, took your turn of the sword; I must\r\n     not, therefore, grudge to take mine of the pestilence.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time his wife was living at Woolwich, and he himself with his\r\nclerks at Greenwich; one maid only remained in the house in London.\r\n\r\nPepys rendered special service at the time of the Fire of London.  He\r\ncommunicated the king's wishes to the Lord Mayor, and he saved the Navy\r\nOffice by having up workmen from Woolwich and Deptford Dockyards to pull\r\ndown the houses around, and so prevent the spread of the flames.\r\n\r\nWhen peace was at length concluded with the Dutch, and people had time to\r\nthink over the disgrace which the country had suffered by the presence of\r\nDe Ruyter's fleet in the Medway, it was natural that a public inquiry into\r\nthe management of the war should be undertaken.  A Parliamentary Committee\r\nwas appointed in October, 1667, to inquire into the matter. Pepys made a\r\nstatement which satisfied the committee, but for months afterwards he was\r\ncontinually being summoned to answer some charge, so that he confesses\r\nhimself as mad to \"become the hackney of this office in perpetual trouble\r\nand vexation that need it least.\"\r\n\r\nAt last a storm broke out in the House of Commons against the principal\r\nofficers of the navy, and some members demanded that they should be put\r\nout of their places.  In the end they were ordered to be heard in their\r\nown defence at the bar of the House.  The whole labour of the defence fell\r\nupon Pepys, but having made out his case with great skill, he was rewarded\r\nby a most unexpected success.  On the 5th March, 1667-68, he made the\r\ngreat speech of his life, and spoke for three hours, with the effect that\r\nhe so far removed the prejudice against the officers of the Navy Board,\r\nthat no further proceedings were taken in parliament on the subject.  He\r\nwas highly praised for his speech, and he was naturally much elated at his\r\nbrilliant success.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1664 we first hear of a defect in Pepys's eyesight.  He\r\nconsulted the celebrated Cocker, and began to wear green spectacles, but\r\ngradually this defect became more pronounced, and on the 31st of May,\r\n1669, he wrote the last words in his Diary:\r\n\r\n     \"And thus ends all that I doubt I shall ever be able to do with my\r\n     own eyes in the keeping of my journal, I being not able to do it any\r\n     longer, having done now as long as to undo my eyes almost every time\r\n     that I take a pen in my hand.\"\r\n\r\nHe feared blindness and was forced to desist, to his lasting regret and\r\nour great loss.\r\n\r\nAt this time he obtained leave of absence from the duties of his office,\r\nand he set out on a tour through France and Holland accompanied by his\r\nwife.  In his travels he was true to the occupation of his life, and made\r\ncollections respecting the French and Dutch navies.  Some months after his\r\nreturn he spoke of his journey as having been \"full of health and\r\ncontent,\" but no sooner had he and his wife returned to London than the\r\nlatter became seriously ill with a fever.  The disease took a fatal turn,\r\nand on the 10th of November, 1669, Elizabeth Pepys died at the early age\r\nof twenty-nine years, to the great grief of her husband.  She died at\r\ntheir house in Crutched Friars, and was buried at St. Olave's Church, Hart\r\nStreet, where Pepys erected a monument to her memory.\r\n\r\nPepys's successful speech at the bar of the House of Commons made him\r\nanxious to become a member, and the Duke of York and Sir William Coventry\r\nheartily supported him in his resolution.  An opening occurred in due\r\ncourse, at Aldborough, in Suffolk, owing to the death of Sir Robert Brooke\r\nin 1669,  but, in consequence of the death of his wife, Pepys was unable\r\nto take part in the election.  His cause was warmly espoused by the Duke\r\nof York and by Lord Henry Howard (afterwards Earl of Norwich and sixth\r\nDuke of Norfolk), but the efforts of his supporters failed, and the\r\ncontest ended in favour of John Bruce, who represented the popular party.\r\nIn November, 1673, Pepys was more successful, and was elected for Castle\r\nRising on the elevation of the member, Sir Robert Paston, to the peerage\r\nas Viscount Yarmouth.  His unsuccessful opponent, Mr. Offley, petitioned\r\nagainst the return, and the election was determined to be void by the\r\nCommittee of Privileges.  The Parliament, however, being prorogued the\r\nfollowing month without the House's coming to any vote on the subject,\r\nPepys was permitted to retain his seat.  A most irrelevant matter was\r\nintroduced into the inquiry, and Pepys was charged with having a crucifix\r\nin his house, from which it was inferred that he was \"a papist or popishly\r\ninclined.\"  The charge was grounded upon reported assertions of Sir John\r\nBanks and the Earl of Shaftesbury, which they did not stand to when\r\nexamined on the subject, and the charge was not proved to be good.\r\n\r\n     [\"The House then proceeding upon the debate touching the Election\r\n     for Castle Rising, between Mr. Pepys and Mr. Offley, did, in the\r\n     first place, take into consideration what related personally to Mr.\r\n     Pepys.  Information being given to the House that they had received\r\n     an account from a person of quality, that he saw an Altar with a\r\n     Crucifix upon it, in the house of Mr. Pepys; Mr. Pepys, standing up\r\n     in his place, did heartily and flatly deny that he ever had any\r\n     Altar or Crucifix, or the image or picture of any Saint whatsoever\r\n     in his house, from the top to the bottom of it; and the Members\r\n     being called upon to name the person that gave them the information,\r\n     they were unwilling to declare it without the order of the House;\r\n     which, being made, they named the Earl of Shaftesbury; and the House\r\n     being also informed that Sir J. Banks did likewise see the Altar, he\r\n     was ordered to attend the Bar of the House, to declare what he knew\r\n     of this matter.  'Ordered that Sir William Coventry, Sir Thomas\r\n     Meeres, and Mr. Garraway do attend Lord Shaftesbury on the like\r\n     occasion, and receive what information his Lordship, can give on\r\n     this matter.'\"--Journals of the House of Commons, vol. ix., p.\r\n     306.--\" 13th February, Sir W. Coventry reports that they attended\r\n     the Earl of Shaftesbury, and received from him the account which\r\n     they had put in writing.  The Earl of Shaftesbury denieth that he\r\n     ever saw an Altar in Mr. Pepys's house or lodgings; as to the\r\n     Crucifix, he saith he hath, some imperfect memory of seeing somewhat\r\n     which he conceived to be a Crucifix.  When his Lordship was asked\r\n     the time, he said it was before the burning of the Office of the\r\n     Navy.  Being asked concerning the manner, he said he could not\r\n     remember whether it were painted or carved, or in what manner the\r\n     thing was; and that his memory was so very imperfect in it, that if\r\n     he were upon his oath he could give no testimony.\"--.  Ibid., vol.\r\n     ix., p. 309.--\" 16th February--Sir John Banks was called in--The\r\n     Speaker desired him to answer what acquaintance he had with; Mr.\r\n     Pepys, and whether he used to have recourse to him to his house and\r\n     had ever seen there any Altar or Crucifix, or whether he knew of his\r\n     being a Papist, or Popishly inclined.  Sir J. Banks said that he had\r\n     known and had been acquainted with Mr. Pepys several years, and had\r\n     often visited him and conversed with him at the Navy Office, and at\r\n     his house there upon several occasions, and that he never saw in his\r\n     house there any Altar or Crucifix, and that he does not believe him\r\n     to be a Papist, or that way inclined in the least, nor had any\r\n     reason or ground to think or believe it.\"--Ibid., vol, ix., p. 310.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the extracts from the Journals of the House of\r\nCommons given in the note that Pepys denied ever having had an altar or\r\ncrucifix in his house.  In the Diary there is a distinct statement of his\r\npossession of a crucifix, but it is not clear from the following extracts\r\nwhether it was not merely a varnished engraving of the Crucifixion which\r\nhe possessed:\r\n\r\n     July 20, 1666.  \"So I away to Lovett's, there to see how my picture\r\n     goes on to be varnished, a fine crucifix which will be very fine.\"\r\n     August 2. \"At home find Lovett, who showed me my crucifix, which\r\n     will be very fine when done.\"  Nov. 3.  \"This morning comes Mr.\r\n     Lovett and brings me my print of the Passion, varnished by him, and\r\n     the frame which is indeed very fine, though not so fine as I\r\n     expected; but pleases me exceedingly.\"\r\n\r\nWhether he had or had not a crucifix in his house was a matter for himself\r\nalone, and the interference of the House of Commons was a gross violation\r\nof the liberty of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Lord Shaftesbury's part in this matter, the late Mr. W.\r\nD. Christie found the following letter to Sir Thomas Meres among the\r\npapers at St. Giles's House, Dorsetshire:--\r\n\r\n                              \"Exeter House, February 10th, 1674.\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--That there might be no mistake, I thought best to put my\r\n     answer in writing to those questions that yourself, Sir William\r\n     Coventry, and Mr. Garroway were pleased to propose to me this\r\n     morning from the House of Commons, which is that I never designed to\r\n     be a witness against any man for what I either heard or saw, and\r\n     therefore did not take so exact notice of things inquired of as to\r\n     be able to remember them so clearly as is requisite to do in a\r\n     testimony upon honour or oath, or to so great and honourable a body\r\n     as the House of Commons, it being some years distance since I was at\r\n     Mr. Pepys his lodging.  Only that particular of an altar is so\r\n     signal that I must needs have remembered it had I seen any such\r\n     thing, which I am sure I do not.  This I desire you to communicate\r\n     with Sir William Coventry and Mr. Garroway to be delivered as my\r\n     answer to the House of Commons, it being the same I gave you this\r\n     morning.\r\n\r\n               \"I am, Sir,\r\n                         \"Your most humble servant,\r\n                                             \"SHAFTESBURY.\"\r\n\r\nAfter reading this letter Sir William Coventry very justly remarked,\r\n\"There are a great many more Catholics than think themselves so, if having\r\na crucifix will make one.\"  Mr. Christie resented the remarks on Lord\r\nShaftesbury's part in this persecution of Pepys made by Lord Braybrooke,\r\nwho said, \"Painful indeed is it to reflect to what length the bad passions\r\nwhich party violence inflames could in those days carry a man of\r\nShaftesbury's rank, station, and abilities.\"  Mr. Christie observes, \"It\r\nis clear from the letter to Meres that Shaftesbury showed no malice and\r\nmuch scrupulousness when a formal charge, involving important results, was\r\nfounded on his loose private conversations.\" This would be a fair\r\nvindication if the above attack upon Pepys stood alone, but we shall see\r\nlater on that Shaftesbury was the moving spirit in a still more\r\nunjustifiable attack.\r\n\r\nLord Sandwich died heroically in the naval action in Southwold Bay, and on\r\nJune 24th,1672, his remains were buried with some pomp in Westminster\r\nAbbey.  There were eleven earls among the mourners, and Pepys, as the\r\nfirst among \"the six Bannerolles,\" walked in the procession.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Pepys was called from his old post of Clerk of the Acts to\r\nthe higher office of Secretary of the Admiralty.  His first appointment\r\nwas a piece of favouritism, but it was due to his merits alone that he\r\nobtained the secretaryship.  In the summer of 1673, the Duke of York\r\nhaving resigned all his appointments on the passing of the Test Act, the\r\nKing put the Admiralty into commission, and Pepys was appointed Secretary\r\nfor the Affairs of the Navy.\r\n\r\n     [The office generally known as Secretary of the Admiralty dates back\r\n     many years, but the officer who filled it was sometimes Secretary to\r\n     the Lord High Admiral, and sometimes to the Commission for that\r\n     office.  \"His Majesties Letters Patent for ye erecting the office of\r\n     Secretary of ye Admiralty of England, and creating Samuel Pepys,\r\n     Esq., first Secretary therein,\" is dated June 10th, 1684.]\r\n\r\nHe was thus brought into more intimate connection with Charles II., who\r\ntook the deepest interest in shipbuilding and all naval affairs.  The Duke\r\nof Buckingham said of the King:--\r\n\r\n     \"The great, almost the only pleasure of his mind to which he seemed\r\n     addicted was shipping and sea affairs, which seemed to be so much\r\n     his talent for knowledge as well as inclination, that a war of that\r\n     kind was rather an entertainment than any disturbance to his\r\n     thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pepys ceased to be Clerk of the Acts he was able to obtain the\r\nappointment for his clerk, Thomas Hayter, and his brother, John Pepys, who\r\nheld it jointly.  The latter does not appear to have done much credit to\r\nSamuel.  He was appointed Clerk to the Trinity House in 1670 on his\r\nbrother's recommendation, and when he died in 1677 he was in debt L300 to\r\nhis employers, and this sum Samuel had to pay.  In 1676 Pepys was Master\r\nof the Trinity House, and in the following year Master of the\r\nClothworkers' Company, when he presented a richly-chased silver cup, which\r\nis still used at the banquets of the company.  On Tuesday, 10th September,\r\n1677, the Feast of the Hon. Artillery Company was held at Merchant\r\nTaylors' Hall, when the Duke of York, the Duke of Somerset, the Lord\r\nChancellor, and other distinguished persons were present.  On this\r\noccasion Viscount Newport, Sir Joseph Williamson, and Samuel Pepys\r\nofficiated as stewards.\r\n\r\nAbout this time it is evident that the secretary carried himself with some\r\nhaughtiness as a ruler of the navy, and that this was resented by some.\r\nAn amusing instance will be found in the Parliamentary Debates. On May\r\n11th, 1678, the King's verbal message to quicken the supply was brought in\r\nby Mr. Secretary Williamson, when Pepys spoke to this effect:\r\n\r\n     \"When I promised that the ships should be ready by the 30th of May,\r\n     it was upon the supposition of the money for 90 ships proposed by\r\n     the King and voted by you, their sizes and rates, and I doubt not by\r\n     that time to have 90 ships, and if they fall short it will be only\r\n     from the failing of the Streights ships coming home and those but\r\n     two .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\n     \"Sir Robert Howard then rose and said, 'Pepys here speaks rather\r\n     like an Admiral than a Secretary, \"I\" and \"we.\"  I wish he knows\r\n     half as much of the Navy as he pretends.'\"\r\n\r\nPepys was chosen by the electors of Harwich as their member in the short\r\nParliament that sat from March to July, 1679, his colleague being Sir\r\nAnthony Deane, but both members were sent to the Tower in May on a\r\nbaseless charge, and they were superseded in the next Parliament that met\r\non the 17th October, 1679.\r\n\r\nThe high-handed treatment which Pepys underwent at this time exhibits a\r\nmarked instance of the disgraceful persecution connected with the\r\nso-called Popish plot.  He was totally unconnected with the Roman Catholic\r\nparty, but his association with the Duke of York was sufficient to mark\r\nhim as a prey for the men who initiated this \"Terror\" of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.  Sir. Edmund Berry Godfrey came to his death in October, 1678,\r\nand in December Samuel Atkins, Pepys's clerk, was brought to trial as an\r\naccessory to his murder.  Shaftesbury and the others not having succeeded\r\nin getting at Pepys through his clerk, soon afterwards attacked him more\r\ndirectly, using the infamous evidence of Colonel Scott.  Much light has\r\nlately been thrown upon the underhand dealings of this miscreant by Mr. G.\r\nD. Scull, who printed privately in 1883 a valuable work entitled,\r\n\"Dorothea Scott, otherwise Gotherson, and Hogben of Egerton House, Kent,\r\n1611-1680.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Scott (calling himself Colonel Scott) ingratiated himself into\r\nacquaintance with Major Gotherson, and sold to the latter large tracts of\r\nland in Long Island, to which he had no right whatever.  Dorothea\r\nGotherson, after her husband's death, took steps to ascertain the exact\r\nstate of her property, and obtained the assistance of Colonel Francis\r\nLovelace, Governor of New York.  Scott's fraud was discovered, and a\r\npetition for redress was presented to the King.  The result of this was\r\nthat the Duke of York commanded Pepys to collect evidence against Scott,\r\nand he accordingly brought together a great number of depositions and\r\ninformation as to his dishonest proceedings in New England, Long Island,\r\nBarbadoes, France, Holland, and England, and these papers are preserved\r\namong the Rawlinson Manuscripts in the Bodleian.  Scott had his revenge,\r\nand accused Pepys of betraying the Navy by sending secret particulars to\r\nthe French Government, and of a design to dethrone the king and extirpate\r\nthe Protestant religion.  Pepys and Sir Anthony Deane were committed to\r\nthe Tower under the Speaker's warrant on May 22nd, 1679, and Pepys's place\r\nat the Admiralty was filled by the appointment of Thomas Hayter. When the\r\ntwo prisoners were brought to the bar of the King's Bench on the 2nd of\r\nJune, the Attorney-General refused bail, but subsequently they were\r\nallowed to find security for L30,000.\r\n\r\nPepys was put to great expense in collecting evidence against Scott and\r\nobtaining witnesses to clear himself of the charges brought against him.\r\nHe employed his brother-in-law, Balthasar St. Michel, to collect evidence\r\nin France, as he himself explains in a letter to the Commissioners of the\r\nNavy:--\r\n\r\n     \"His Majesty of his gracious regard to me, and the justification of\r\n     my innocence, was then pleased at my humble request to dispence with\r\n     my said brother goeing (with ye shippe about that time designed for\r\n     Tangier) and to give leave to his goeing into France (the scene of\r\n     ye villannys then in practice against me), he being the only person\r\n     whom (from his relation to me, together with his knowledge in the\r\n     place and language, his knowne dilligence and particular affection\r\n     towards mee) I could at that tyme and in soe greate a cause pitch\r\n     on, for committing the care of this affaire of detecting the\r\n     practice of my enemies there.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end Scott refused to acknowledge to the truth of his original\r\ndeposition, and the prisoners were relieved from their bail on February\r\n12th, 1679-80.  John James, a butler previously in Pepys's service,\r\nconfessed on his deathbed in 1680 that he had trumped up the whole story\r\nrelating to his former master's change of religion at the instigation of\r\nMr. William Harbord, M.P. for Thetford.\r\n\r\nPepys wrote on July 1st, 1680, to Mrs. Skinner:\r\n\r\n     \"I would not omit giving you the knowledge of my having at last\r\n     obtained what with as much reason I might have expected a year ago,\r\n     my full discharge from the bondage I have, from one villain's\r\n     practice, so long lain under.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Harbord, of Cadbury, co.  Somerset, second son of Sir Charles\r\nHarbord, whom he succeeded in 1682 as Surveyor.  General of the Land\r\nRevenues of the Crown, was Pepys's most persistent enemy.  Several papers\r\nreferring to Harbord's conduct were found at Scott's lodging after his\r\nflight, and are now preserved among the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian.\r\nOne of these was the following memorandum, which shows pretty plainly\r\nPepys's opinion of Harbord:--\r\n\r\n     \"That about the time of Mr. Pepys's surrender of his employment of\r\n     Secretary of the Admiralty, Capt. Russell and myself being in\r\n     discourse about Mr. Pepys, Mr. Russell delivered himself in these or\r\n     other words to this purport: That he thought it might be of\r\n     advantage to both, if a good understanding were had between his\r\n     brother Harbord and Mr. Pepys, asking me to propose it to Mr. Pepys,\r\n     and he would to his brother, which I agreed to, and went immediately\r\n     from him to Mr. Pepys, and telling him of this discourse, he gave me\r\n     readily this answer in these very words: That he knew of no service\r\n     Mr. Harbord could doe him, or if he could, he should be the last man\r\n     in England he would receive any from.\"\r\n\r\n     [William Harbord sat as M.P.  for Thetford in several parliaments.\r\n     In 1689 he was chosen on the Privy Council, and in 1690 became Vice-\r\n     Treasurer for Ireland.  He was appointed Ambassador to Turkey in\r\n     1692, and died at Belgrade in July of that year.]\r\n\r\nBesides Scott's dishonesty in his dealings with Major Gotherson, it came\r\nout that he had cheated the States of Holland out of L7,000, in\r\nconsequence of which he was hanged in effigy at the Hague in 1672.  In\r\n1682 he fled from England to escape from the law, as he had been guilty of\r\nwilful murder by killing George Butler, a hackney coachman, and he reached\r\nNorway in safety, where he remained till 1696.  In that year some of his\r\ninfluential friends obtained a pardon for him from William III., and he\r\nreturned to England.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1680, Pepys attended on Charles II. at Newmarket, and there he\r\ntook down from the King's own mouth the narrative of his Majesty's escape\r\nfrom Worcester, which was first published in 1766 by Sir David Dalrymple\r\n(Lord Hailes) from the MS., which now remains in the Pepysian library both\r\nin shorthand and in longhand?  It is creditable to Charles II. and the\r\nDuke of York that both brothers highly appreciated the abilities of Pepys,\r\nand availed themselves of his knowledge of naval affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the following year there was some chance that Pepys might retire from\r\npublic affairs, and take upon himself the headship of one of the chief\r\nCambridge colleges.  On the death of Sir Thomas Page, the Provost of\r\nKing's College, in August, 1681, Mr. S. Maryon, a Fellow of Clare Hall,\r\nrecommended Pepys to apply to the King for the appointment, being assured\r\nthat the royal mandate if obtained would secure his election.  He liked\r\nthe idea, but replied that he believed Colonel Legge (afterwards Lord\r\nDartmouth) wanted to get the office for an old tutor.  Nothing further\r\nseems to have been done by Pepys, except that he promised if he were\r\nchosen to give the whole profit of the first year, and at least half of\r\nthat of each succeeding year, to \"be dedicated to the general and public\r\nuse of the college.\"  In the end Dr. John Coplestone was appointed to the\r\npost.\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd, 1681, the Rev. Dr. Milles, rector of St. Olave's, who is so\r\noften mentioned in the Diary, gave Pepys a certificate as to his attention\r\nto the services of the Church.  It is not quite clear what was the\r\noccasion of the certificate, but probably the Diarist wished to have it\r\nready in case of another attack upon him in respect to his tendency\r\ntowards the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1682 Pepys accompanied the Duke of York to Scotland, and narrowly\r\nescaped shipwreck by the way.  Before letters could arrive in London to\r\ntell of his safety, the news came of the wreck of the \"Gloucester\" (the\r\nDuke's ship), and of the loss of many lives.  His friends' anxiety was\r\nrelieved by the arrival of a letter which Pepys wrote from Edinburgh to\r\nHewer on May 8th, in which he detailed the particulars of the adventure.\r\nThe Duke invited him to go on board the \"Gloucester\" frigate, but he\r\npreferred his own yacht (the \"Catherine \"), in which he had more room, and\r\nin consequence of his resolution he saved himself from the risk of\r\ndrowning.  On May 5th the frigate struck upon the sand called \"The Lemon\r\nand Oar,\" about sixteen leagues from the mouth of the Humber.  This was\r\ncaused by the carelessness of the pilot, to whom Pepys imputed \"an\r\nobstinate over-weening in opposition to the contrary opinions of Sir I.\r\nBerry, his master, mates, Col. Legg, the Duke himself, and several others,\r\nconcurring unanimously in not being yet clear of the sands.\"  The Duke and\r\nhis party escaped, but numbers were drowned in the sinking ship, and it is\r\nsaid that had the wreck occurred two hours earlier, and the accompanying\r\nyachts been at the distance they had previously been, not a soul would\r\nhave escaped.\r\n\r\nPepys stayed in Edinburgh for a short time, and the Duke of York allowed\r\nhim to be present at two councils.  He then visited; with Colonel George\r\nLegge, some of the principal places in the neighbourhood, such as\r\nStirling, Linlithgow, Hamilton, and Glasgow.  The latter place he\r\ndescribes as \"a very extraordinary town indeed for beauty and trade, much\r\nsuperior to any in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nPepys had now been out of office for some time, but he was soon to have\r\nemployment again.  Tangier, which was acquired at the marriage of the King\r\nto Katharine of Braganza, had long been an incumbrance, and it was\r\nresolved at last to destroy the place.  Colonel Legge (now Lord Dartmouth)\r\nwas in August, 1683, constituted Captain-General of his Majesty's forces\r\nin Africa, and Governor of Tangier, and sent with a fleet of about twenty\r\nsail to demolish and blow up the works, destroy the harbour, and bring\r\nhome the garrison.  Pepys received the King's commands to accompany Lord\r\nDartmouth on his expedition, but the latter's instructions were secret,\r\nand Pepys therefore did not know what had been decided upon.  He saw quite\r\nenough, however, to form a strong opinion of the uselessness of the place\r\nto England.  Lord Dartmouth carried out his instructions thoroughly, and\r\non March 29th, 1684, he and his party (including Pepys) arrived in the\r\nEnglish Channel.\r\n\r\nThe King himself now resumed the office of Lord High Admiral, and\r\nappointed Pepys Secretary of the Admiralty, with a salary of L500 per\r\nannum.  In the Pepysian Library is the original patent, dated June 10th,\r\n1684: \"His Majesty's Letters Patent for ye erecting the office of\r\nSecretary of ye Admiralty of England, and creating Samuel Pepys, Esq.,\r\nfirst Secretary therein.\"  In this office the Diarist remained until the\r\nperiod of the Revolution, when his official career was concluded.\r\n\r\nA very special honour was conferred upon Pepys in this year, when he was\r\nelected President of the Royal Society in succession to Sir Cyril Wyche,\r\nand he held the office for two years.  Pepys had been admitted a fellow of\r\nthe society on February 15th, 1664-65, and from Birch's \"History\" we find\r\nthat in the following month he made a statement to the society:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pepys gave an account of what information he had received from the\r\nMaster of the Jersey ship which had been in company with Major Holmes in\r\nthe Guinea voyage concerning the pendulum watches (March 15th, 1664-5).\"\r\n\r\nThe records of the society show that he frequently made himself useful by\r\nobtaining such information as might be required in his department.  After\r\nhe retired from the presidency, he continued to entertain some of the most\r\ndistinguished members of the society on Saturday evenings at his house in\r\nYork Buildings.  Evelyn expressed the strongest regret when it was\r\nnecessary to discontinue these meetings on account of the infirmities of\r\nthe host.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 Charles II. died, and was succeeded by James, Duke of York.  From\r\nhis intimate association with James it might have been supposed that a\r\nlong period of official life was still before Pepys, but the new king's\r\nbigotry and incapacity soon made this a practical impossibility.  At the\r\ncoronation of James II.  Pepys marched in the procession immediately\r\nbehind the king's canopy, as one of the sixteen barons of the Cinque\r\nPorts.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1685 a new charter was granted to the Trinity Company, and\r\nPepys was named in it the first master, this being the second time that he\r\nhad held the office of master.\r\n\r\nEvelyn specially refers to the event in his Diary, and mentions the\r\ndistinguished persons present at the dinner on July 20th.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that at this time Pepys was looked upon as a specially\r\ninfluential man, and when a parliament was summoned to meet on May 19th,\r\n1685, he was elected both for Harwich and for Sandwich.  He chose to serve\r\nfor Harwich, and Sir Philip Parker was elected to fill his place at\r\nSandwich.\r\n\r\nThis parliament was dissolved by proclamation July 2nd, 1687, and on\r\nAugust 24th the king declared in council that another parliament should be\r\nsummoned for November 27th, 1688, but great changes took place before that\r\ndate, and when the Convention Parliament was called together in January\r\nand February, 1689-90, Pepys found no place in it.  The right-hand man of\r\nthe exiled monarch was not likely to find favour in the eyes of those who\r\nwere now in possession.  When the election for Harwich came on, the\r\nelectors refused to return him, and the streets echoed to the cry of \"No\r\nTower men, no men out of the Tower!\"  They did not wish to be represented\r\nin parliament by a disgraced official.\r\n\r\nWe have little or no information to guide us as to Pepys's proceedings at\r\nthe period of the Revolution.  We know that James II.  just before his\r\nflight was sitting to Kneller for a portrait intended for the Secretary to\r\nthe Admiralty, and that Pepys acted in that office for the last time on\r\n20th February, 1688-89, but between those dates we know nothing of the\r\nanxieties and troubles that he must have suffered.  On the 9th March an\r\norder was issued from the Commissioners of the Admiralty for him to\r\ndeliver up his books, &c., to Phineas Bowies, who superseded him as\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nPepys had many firm friends upon whom he could rely, but he had also\r\nenemies who lost no opportunity of worrying him.  On June 10th, 1690,\r\nEvelyn has this entry in his Diary, which throws some light upon the\r\nevents of the time:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Pepys read to me his Remonstrance, skewing with what malice and\r\n     injustice he was suspected with Sir Anth. Deane about the timber of\r\n     which the thirty ships were built by a late Act of Parliament, with\r\n     the exceeding danger which the fleete would shortly be in, by reason\r\n     of the tyranny and incompetency of those who now managed the\r\n     Admiralty and affairs of the Navy, of which he gave an accurate\r\n     state, and shew'd his greate ability.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of this same month Pepys was committed to the Gatehouse at\r\nWestminster on a charge of having sent information to the French Court of\r\nthe state of the English navy.  There was no evidence of any kind against\r\nhim, and at the end of July he was allowed to return to his own house on\r\naccount of ill-health.  Nothing further was done in respect to the charge,\r\nbut he was not free till some time after, and he was long kept in anxiety,\r\nfor even in 1692 he still apprehended some fresh persecution.\r\n\r\nSir Peter Palavicini, Mr. James Houblon, Mr. Blackburne, and Mr. Martin\r\nbailed him, and he sent them the following circular letter:--\r\n\r\n                                             \"October 15, 1690.\r\n\r\n     \"Being this day become once again a free man in every respect, I\r\n     mean but that of my obligation to you and the rest of my friends, to\r\n     whom I stand indebted for my being so, I think it but a reasonable\r\n     part of my duty to pay you and them my thanks for it in a body; but\r\n     know not how otherwise to compass it than by begging you, which I\r\n     hereby do, to take your share with them and me here, to-morrow, of a\r\n     piece of mutton, which is all I dare promise you, besides that of\r\n     being ever,\r\n\r\n               \"Your most bounden and faithful humble servant,\r\n                                                       \"S. P.\"\r\n\r\nHe employed the enforced idleness caused by being thrust out of his\r\nemployment in the collection of the materials for the valuable work which\r\nhe published in 1690, under the title of \"Memoirs of the Navy.\"  Little\r\nmore was left for him to do in life, but as the government became more\r\nfirmly established, and the absolute absurdity of the idea of his\r\ndisloyalty was proved, Pepys held up his head again as a man to be\r\nrespected and consulted, and for the remainder of his life he was looked\r\nupon as the Nestor of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThere is little more to be told of Pepys's life.  He continued to keep up\r\nan extended correspondence with his many friends, and as Treasurer of\r\nChrist's Hospital he took very great interest in the welfare of that\r\ninstitution.  He succeeded in preserving from impending ruin the\r\nmathematical foundation which had been originally designed by him, and\r\nthrough his anxious solicitations endowed and cherished by Charles II. and\r\nJames II.  One of the last public acts of his life was the presentation of\r\nthe portrait of the eminent Dr. John Wallis, Savilian Professor of\r\nGeometry, to the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn 1701 he sent Sir Godfrey Kneller to Oxford to paint the portrait, and\r\nthe University rewarded him with a Latin diploma containing in gorgeous\r\nlanguage the expression of thanks for his munificence.'\r\n\r\nOn the 26th May, 1703, Samuel Pepys, after long continued suffering,\r\nbreathed his last in the presence of the learned Dr. George Hickes, the\r\nnonjuring Dean of Worcester, and the following letter from John Jackson to\r\nhis uncle's lifelong friend Evelyn contains particulars as to the cause of\r\ndeath:\r\n\r\n                       Mr.  Jackson to Mr. Evelyn.\r\n\r\n                                        \"Clapham, May 28th, 1703.\r\n                                        \"Friday night.\r\n\r\n     \"Honoured Sir,\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis no small addition to my grief, to be obliged to interrupt the\r\n     quiet of your happy recess with the afflicting tidings of my Uncle\r\n     Pepys's death: knowing how sensibly you will partake with me herein.\r\n     But I should not be faithful to his desires, if I did not beg your\r\n     doing the honour to his memory of accepting mourning from him, as a\r\n     small instance of his most affectionate respect and honour for you.\r\n     I have thought myself extremely unfortunate to be out of the way at\r\n     that only time when you were pleased lately to touch here, and\r\n     express so great a desire of taking your leave of my Uncle; which\r\n     could not but have been admitted by him as a most welcome exception\r\n     to his general orders against being interrupted; and I could most\r\n     heartily wish that the circumstances of your health and distance did\r\n     not forbid me to ask the favour of your assisting in the holding up\r\n     of the pawll at his interment, which is intended to be on Thursday\r\n     next; for if the manes are affected with what passes below, I am\r\n     sure this would have been very grateful to his.\r\n\r\n     \"I must not omit acquainting you, sir, that upon opening his body,\r\n     (which the uncommonness of his case required of us, for our own\r\n     satisfaction as well as public good) there was found in his left\r\n     kidney a nest of no less than seven stones, of the most irregular,\r\n     figures your imagination can frame, and weighing together four\r\n     ounces and a half, but all fast linked together, and adhering to his\r\n     back; whereby they solve his having felt no greater pains upon\r\n     motion, nor other of the ordinary symptoms of the stone.  Some other\r\n     lesser defects there also were in his body, proceeding from the same\r\n     cause.  But his stamina, in general, were marvellously strong, and\r\n     not only supported him, under the most exquisite pains, weeks beyond\r\n     all expectations; but, in the conclusion, contended for nearly forty\r\n     hours (unassisted by any nourishment) with the very agonies of\r\n     death, some few minutes excepted, before his expiring, which were\r\n     very calm.\r\n\r\n     \"There remains only for me, under this affliction, to beg the\r\n     consolation and honour of succeeding to your patronage, for my\r\n     Uncle's sake; and leave to number myself, with the same sincerity he\r\n     ever did, among your greatest honourers, which I shall esteem as one\r\n     of the most valuable parts of my inheritances from him; being also,\r\n     with the faithfullest wishes of health and a happy long life to you,\r\n\r\n                    \"Honoured Sir,\r\n                         \"Your most obedient and\r\n                              \"Most humble Servant,\r\n                                        \"J.

He speaks in very high terms of his friend:--\r\n\r\n     \"1703, May 26th.  This day died Mr. Sam Pepys, a very worthy,\r\n     industrious, and curious person, none in England exceeding him in\r\n     knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed thro' all the most\r\n     considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the\r\n     Admiralty, all which he performed with great integrity.  When K.\r\n     James II.  went out of England, he laid down his office, and would\r\n     serve no more, but withdrawing himselfe from all public affaires, he\r\n     liv'd at Clapham with his partner Mr. Hewer, formerly his clerk, in\r\n     a very noble and sweete place, where he enjoy'd the fruits of his\r\n     labours in greate prosperity.  He was universally belov'd,\r\n     hospitable, generous, learned in many things, skilfd in music, a\r\n     very greate cherisher of learned men of whom he had the conversation\r\n     .  .  .  .  Mr. Pepys had been for neere 40 yeeres so much my\r\n     particular friend that Mr. Jackson sent me compleat mourning,\r\n     desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at his magnificent\r\n     obsequies, but my indisposition hinder'd me from doing him this last\r\n     office.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was brought from Clapham and buried in St. Olave's Church, Hart\r\nStreet, on the 5th June, at nine o'clock at night, in a vault just beneath\r\nthe monument to the memory of Mrs. Pepys.  Dr. Hickes performed the last\r\nsad offices for his friend.\r\n\r\nPepys's faithful friend, Hewer, was his executor, and his nephew, John\r\nJackson, his heir.  Mourning was presented to forty persons, and a large\r\nnumber of rings to relations, godchildren, servants, and friends, also to\r\nrepresentatives of the Royal Society, of the Universities of Cambridge and\r\nOxford, of the Admiralty, and of the Navy Office.  The bulk of the\r\nproperty was bequeathed to Jackson, but the money which was left was much\r\nless than might have been expected, for at the time of Pepys's death\r\nthere was a balance of L28,007  2s. 1d.  due to him from the Crown, and\r\nnone of this was ever paid.  The books and other collections were left to\r\nMagdalene College, Cambridge, but Jackson was to have possession of them\r\nduring his lifetime.  These were the most important portion of Pepys's\r\neffects, for with them was the manuscript of the immortal Diary.  The\r\nfollowing are the directions for the disposition of the library, taken\r\nfrom Harl. MS., No. 7301:\r\n\r\n     \"For the further settlement and preservation of my said library,\r\n     after the death of my nephew.  John Jackson, I do hereby declare,\r\n     That could I be sure of a constant succession of heirs from my said\r\n     nephew, qualified like himself for the use of such a library, I\r\n     should not entertain a thought of its ever being alienated from\r\n     them.  But this uncertainty considered, with the infinite pains, and\r\n     time, and cost employed in my collecting, methodising and reducing\r\n     the same to the state it now is, I cannot but be greatly solicitous\r\n     that all possible provision should be made for its unalterable\r\n     preservation and perpetual security against the ordinary fate of\r\n     such collections falling into the hands of an incompetent heir, and\r\n     thereby being sold, dissipated, or embezzled.  And since it has\r\n     pleased God to visit me in a manner that leaves little appearance of\r\n     being myself restored to a condition of concerting the necessary\r\n     measures for attaining these ends, I must and do with great\r\n     confidence rely upon the sincerity and direction of my executor and\r\n     said nephew for putting in execution the powers given them, by my\r\n     forementioned will relating hereto, requiring that the same be\r\n     brought to a determination in twelve months after my decease, and\r\n     that special regard be had therein to the following particulars\r\n     which I declare to be my present thoughts and prevailing\r\n     inclinations in this matter, viz.:\r\n\r\n     \"1.  That after the death of my said nephew, my said library be\r\n     placed and for ever settled in one of our universities, and rather\r\n     in that of Cambridge than Oxford.\r\n\r\n     \"2.  And rather in a private college there, than in the public\r\n     library.\r\n\r\n     \"3.  And in the colleges of Trinity or Magdalen preferably to all\r\n     others.\r\n\r\n     \"4.  And of these too, 'caeteris paribus', rather in the latter, for\r\n     the sake of my own and my nephew's education therein.\r\n\r\n     \"5.  That in which soever of the two it is, a fair roome be provided\r\n     therein.\r\n\r\n     \"6.  And if in Trinity, that the said roome be contiguous to, and\r\n     have communication with, the new library there.\r\n\r\n     \"7.  And if in Magdalen, that it be in the new building there, and\r\n     any part thereof at my nephew's election.\r\n\r\n     \"8.  That my said library be continued in its present form and no\r\n     other books mixed therein, save what my nephew may add to theirs of\r\n     his own collecting, in distinct presses.\r\n\r\n     \"9.  That the said room and books so placed and adjusted be called\r\n     by the name of 'Bibliotheca Pepysiana.'\r\n\r\n     \"10.  That this 'Bibliotheca Pepysiana' be under the sole power and\r\n     custody of the master of the college for the time being, who shall\r\n     neither himself convey, nor suffer to be conveyed by others, any of\r\n     the said books from thence to any other place, except to his own\r\n     lodge in the said college, nor there have more than ten of them at a\r\n     time; and that of those also a strict entry be made and account\r\n     kept, at the time of their having been taken out and returned, in a\r\n     book to be provided, and remain in the said library for that purpose\r\n     only.\r\n\r\n     \"11.  That before my said library be put into the possession of\r\n     either of the said colleges, that college for which it shall be\r\n     designed, first enter into covenants for performance of the\r\n     foregoing articles.\r\n\r\n     \"12.  And that for a yet further security herein, the said two\r\n     colleges of Trinity and Magdalen have a reciprocal check upon one\r\n     another; and that college which shall be in present possession of\r\n     the said library, be subject to an annual visitation from the other,\r\n     and to the forfeiture thereof to the life, possession, and use of\r\n     the other, upon conviction of any breach of their said covenants.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"S. PEPYS.\"\r\n\r\nThe library and the original book-cases were not transferred to Magdalene\r\nCollege until 1724, and there they have been preserved in safety ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nA large number of Pepys's manuscripts appear to have remained unnoticed in\r\nYork Buildings for some years.  They never came into Jackson's hands, and\r\nwere thus lost to Magdalene College.  Dr. Rawlinson afterwards obtained\r\nthem, and they were included in the bequest of his books to the Bodleian\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nPepys was partial to having his portrait taken, and he sat to Savill,\r\nHales, Lely, and Kneller.  Hales's portrait, painted in 1666, is now in\r\nthe National Portrait Gallery, and an etching from the original forms the\r\nfrontispiece to this volume.  The portrait by Lely is in the Pepysian\r\nLibrary.  Of the three portraits by Kneller, one is in the hall of\r\nMagdalene College, another at the Royal Society, and the third was lent to\r\nthe First Special Exhibition of National Portraits, 1866, by the late Mr.\r\nAndrew Pepys Cockerell.  Several of the portraits have been engraved, but\r\nthe most interesting of these are those used by Pepys himself as\r\nbook-plates.  These were both engraved by Robert White, and taken from\r\npaintings by Kneller.\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Olave, Hart Street, is intimately associated with Pepys\r\nboth in his life and in his death, and for many years the question had\r\nbeen constantly asked by visitors, \"Where is Pepys's monument?\" On\r\nWednesday, July 5th, 1882, a meeting was held in the vestry of the church,\r\nwhen an influential committee was appointed, upon which all the great\r\ninstitutions with which Pepys was connected were represented by their\r\nmasters, presidents, or other officers, with the object of taking steps to\r\nobtain an adequate memorial of the Diarist.  Mr. (now Sir) Alfred\r\nBlomfield, architect of the church, presented an appropriate design for a\r\nmonument, and sufficient subscriptions having been obtained for the\r\npurpose, he superintended its erection.  On Tuesday afternoon, March 18th,\r\n1884, the monument, which was affixed to the wall of the church where the\r\ngallery containing Pepys's pew formerly stood, was unveiled in the\r\npresence of a large concourse of visitors.  The Earl of Northbrook, First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, consented to unveil the monument, but he was at the\r\nlast moment prevented by public business from attending.  The late Mr.\r\nRussell Lowell, then the American Minister, took Lord Northbrook's place,\r\nand made a very charming and appreciative speech on the occasion, from\r\nwhich the following passages are extracted:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was proper,\" his Excellency said, \"that he should read a note he\r\n     had received from Lord Northbrook.  This was dated that day from the\r\n     Admiralty, and was as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'My dear Mr. Lowell,\r\n\r\n     \"'I am very much annoyed that I am prevented from assisting at the\r\n     ceremony to-day.  It would be very good if you would say that\r\n     nothing but very urgent business would have kept me away.  I was\r\n     anxious to give my testimony to the merits of Pepys as an Admiralty\r\n     official, leaving his literary merits to you.  He was concerned with\r\n     the administration of the Navy from the Restoration to the\r\n     Revolution, and from 1673 as secretary.  I believe his merits to be\r\n     fairly stated in a contemporary account, which I send.\r\n\r\n                         \"'Yours very truly,\r\n                                        \"'NORTHBROOK.\r\n\r\n     \"The contemporary account, which Lord Northbrook was good enough to\r\n     send him, said:\r\n\r\n     \"'Pepys was, without exception, the greatest and most useful\r\n     Minister that ever filled the same situations in England, the acts\r\n     and registers of the Admiralty proving this beyond contradiction.\r\n     The principal rules and establishments in present use in these\r\n     offices are well known to have been of his introducing, and most of\r\n     the officers serving therein since the Restoration, of his bringing-\r\n     up.  He was a most studious promoter and strenuous asserter of order\r\n     and discipline.  Sobriety, diligence, capacity, loyalty, and\r\n     subjection to command were essentials required in all whom he\r\n     advanced.  Where any of these were found wanting, no interest or\r\n     authority was capable of moving him in favour of the highest\r\n     pretender.  Discharging his duty to his Prince and country with a\r\n     religious application and perfect integrity, he feared no one,\r\n     courted no one, and neglected his own fortune.'\r\n\r\n     \"That was a character drawn, it was true, by a friendly hand, but to\r\n     those who were familiar with the life of Pepys, the praise hardly\r\n     seemed exaggerated.  As regarded his official life, it was\r\n     unnecessary to dilate upon his peculiar merits, for they all knew\r\n     how faithful he was in his duties, and they all knew, too, how many\r\n     faithful officials there were working on in obscurity, who were not\r\n     only never honoured with a monument but who never expected one.  The\r\n     few words, Mr. Lowell went on to remark, which he was expected to\r\n     say upon that occasion, therefore, referred rather to what he\r\n     believed was the true motive which had brought that assembly\r\n     together, and that was by no means the character of Pepys either as\r\n     Clerk of the Acts or as Secretary to the Admiralty.  This was not\r\n     the place in which one could go into a very close examination of the\r\n     character of Pepys as a private man.  He would begin by admitting\r\n     that Pepys was a type, perhaps, of what was now called a\r\n     'Philistine'.  We had no word in England which was equivalent to the\r\n     French adjective Bourgeois; but, at all events, Samuel Pepys was the\r\n     most perfect type that ever existed of the class of people whom this\r\n     word described.  He had all its merits as well as many of its\r\n     defects.  With all those defects, however perhaps in consequence of\r\n     them--Pepys had written one of the most delightful books that it was\r\n     man's privilege to read in the English language or in any other.\r\n     Whether Pepys intended this Diary to be afterwards read by the\r\n     general public or not--and this was a doubtful question when it was\r\n     considered that he had left, possibly by inadvertence, a key to his\r\n     cypher behind him--it was certain that he had left with us a most\r\n     delightful picture, or rather he had left the power in our hands of\r\n     drawing for ourselves some, of the most delightful pictures, of the\r\n     time in which he lived.  There was hardly any book which was\r\n     analogous to it .  ..  .  .  If one were asked what were the reasons\r\n     for liking Pepys, it would be found that they were as numerous as\r\n     the days upon which he made an entry in his Diary, and surely that\r\n     was sufficient argument in his favour.  There was no book, Mr.\r\n     Lowell said, that he knew of, or that occurred to his memory, with\r\n     which Pepys's Diary could fairly be compared, except the journal of\r\n     L'Estoile, who had the same anxious curiosity and the same\r\n     commonness, not to say vulgarity of interest, and the book was\r\n     certainly unique in one respect, and that was the absolute sincerity\r\n     of the author with himself.  Montaigne is conscious that we are\r\n     looking over his shoulder, and Rousseau secretive in comparison with\r\n     him.  The very fact of that sincerity of the author with himself\r\n     argued a certain greatness of character.  Dr. Hickes, who attended\r\n     Pepys at his deathbed, spoke of him as 'this great man,' and said he\r\n     knew no one who died so greatly.  And yet there was something almost\r\n     of the ridiculous in the statement when the 'greatness' was compared\r\n     with the garrulous frankness which Pepys showed towards himself.\r\n     There was no parallel to the character of Pepys, he believed, in\r\n     respect of 'naivete', unless it were found in that of Falstaff, and\r\n     Pepys showed himself, too, like Falstaff, on terms of unbuttoned\r\n     familiarity with himself.  Falstaff had just the same 'naivete', but\r\n     in Falstaff it was the 'naivete' of conscious humour.  In Pepys it\r\n     was quite different, for Pepys's 'naivete' was the inoffensive\r\n     vanity of a man who loved to see himself in the glass.  Falstaff had\r\n     a sense, too, of inadvertent humour, but it was questionable whether\r\n     Pepys could have had any sense of humour at all, and yet permitted\r\n     himself to be so delightful.  There was probably, however, more\r\n     involuntary humour in Pepys's Diary than there was in any other book\r\n     extant.  When he told his readers of the landing of Charles II. at\r\n     Dover, for instance, it would be remembered how Pepys chronicled the\r\n     fact that the Mayor of Dover presented the Prince with a Bible, for\r\n     which he returned his thanks and said it was the 'most precious Book\r\n     to him in the world.'  Then, again, it would be remembered how, when\r\n     he received a letter addressed 'Samuel Pepys, Esq.,' he confesses in\r\n     the Diary that this pleased him mightily.  When, too, he kicked his\r\n     cookmaid, he admits that he was not sorry for it, but was sorry that\r\n     the footboy of a worthy knight with whom he was acquainted saw him\r\n     do it.  And the last instance he would mention of poor Pepys's\r\n     'naivete' was when he said in the Diary that he could not help\r\n     having a certain pleasant and satisfied feeling when Barlow died.\r\n     Barlow, it must be remembered, received during his life the yearly\r\n     sum from Pepys of L100.  The value of Pepys's book was simply\r\n     priceless, and while there was nothing in it approaching that single\r\n     page in St. Simon where he described that thunder of courtierly red\r\n     heels passing from one wing of the Palace to another as the Prince\r\n     was lying on his death-bed, and favour was to flow from another\r\n     source, still Pepys's Diary was unequalled in its peculiar quality\r\n     of amusement.  The lightest part of the Diary was of value,\r\n     historically, for it enabled one to see London of 200 years ago,\r\n     and, what was more, to see it with the eager eyes of Pepys.  It was\r\n     not Pepys the official who had brought that large gathering together\r\n     that day in honour of his memory: it was Pepys the Diarist.\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding this account of the chief particulars of Pepys's life it may\r\nbe well to add a few words upon the pronunciation of his name. Various\r\nattempts appear to have been made to represent this phonetically. Lord\r\nBraybrooke, in quoting the entry of death from St. Olave's Registers,\r\nwhere the spelling is \"Peyps,\" wrote, \"This is decisive as to the proper\r\npronunciation of the name.\"  This spelling may show that the name was\r\npronounced as a monosyllable, but it is scarcely conclusive as to anything\r\nelse, and Lord Braybrooke does not say what he supposes the sound of the\r\nvowels to have been.  At present there are three pronunciations in\r\nuse--Peps, which is the most usual; Peeps, which is the received one at\r\nMagdalene College, and Peppis, which I learn from Mr. Walter C. Pepys is\r\nthe one used by other branches of the family.  Mr. Pepys has paid\r\nparticular attention to this point, and in his valuable \"Genealogy of the\r\nPepys Family\" (1887) he has collected seventeen varieties of spelling of\r\nthe name, which are as follows, the dates of the documents in which the\r\nform appears being attached:\r\n\r\n1. Pepis (1273); 2. Pepy (1439); 3. Pypys (1511); 4.  Pipes (1511);\r\n5. Peppis (1518); 6. Peppes (1519); 7. Pepes (1520); 8. Peppys (1552);\r\n9. Peaps (1636); 10. Pippis (1639); 11. Peapys (1653); 12. Peps (1655);\r\n13. Pypes (1656); 14.  Peypes (1656); 15. Peeps (1679); 16. Peepes (1683);\r\n17. Peyps (1703).  Mr. Walter Pepys adds:--\r\n\r\n     \"The accepted spelling of the name 'Pepys' was adopted generally\r\n     about the end of the seventeenth century, though it occurs many\r\n     years before that time.  There have been numerous ways of\r\n     pronouncing the name, as 'Peps,' 'Peeps,' and ' Peppis.'  The\r\n     Diarist undoubtedly pronounced it 'Peeps,' and the lineal\r\n     descendants of his sister Paulina, the family of 'Pepys Cockerell'\r\n     pronounce it so to this day.  The other branches of the family all\r\n     pronounce it as 'Peppis,' and I am led to be satisfied that the\r\n     latter pronunciation is correct by the two facts that in the\r\n     earliest known writing it is spelt 'Pepis,' and that the French form\r\n     of the name is 'Pepy.'\"\r\n\r\nThe most probable explanation is that the name in the seventeenth century\r\nwas either pronounced 'Pips' or 'Papes'; for both the forms 'ea' and 'ey'\r\nwould represent the latter pronunciation.  The general change in the\r\npronunciation of the spelling 'ea' from 'ai' to 'ee' took place in a large\r\nnumber of words at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the\r\neighteenth-century, and three words at least (yea, break, and great) keep\r\nthis old pronunciation still.  The present Irish pronunciation of English\r\nis really the same as the English pronunciation of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when the most extensive settlement of Englishmen in Ireland took\r\nplace, and the Irish always pronounce ea like ai (as, He gave him a nate\r\nbating--neat beating).  Again, the 'ey' of Peyps would rhyme with they and\r\nobey.  English literature is full of illustrations of the old\r\npronunciation of ea, as in \"Hudibras;\"\r\n\r\n              \"Doubtless the pleasure is as great\r\n               In being cheated as to cheat,\"\r\n\r\nwhich was then a perfect rhyme.  In the \"Rape of the Lock\" tea (tay)\r\nrhymes with obey, and in Cowper's verses on Alexander Selkirk sea rhymes\r\nwith survey.' It is not likely that the pronunciation of the name was\r\nfixed, but there is every reason to suppose that the spellings of Peyps\r\nand Peaps were intended to represent the sound Pepes rather than Peeps.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the research which has brought to light so many incidents\r\nof interest in the life of Samuel Pepys, we cannot but feel how dry these\r\nfacts are when placed by the side of the living details of the Diary. It\r\nis in its pages that the true man is displayed, and it has therefore not\r\nbeen thought necessary here to do more than set down in chronological\r\norder such facts as are known of the life outside the Diary.  A fuller\r\n\"appreciation\" of the man must be left for some future occasion.\r\n\r\n                                   H. B.

They came at the start of my\r\nlife's journey, like the first streak of dawn, giving me golden\r\nprovision to carry me on my way.\r\n\r\nThe sky which gives light is blue, and my mother's face was dark,\r\nbut she had the radiance of holiness, and her beauty would put to\r\nshame all the vanity of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nEveryone says that I resemble my mother.  In my childhood I used\r\nto resent this.  It made me angry with my mirror.  I thought that\r\nit was God's unfairness which was wrapped round my limbs--that my\r\ndark features were not my due, but had come to me by some\r\nmisunderstanding.  All that remained for me to ask of my God in\r\nreparation was, that I might grow up to be a model of what woman\r\nshould be, as one reads it in some epic poem.\r\n\r\nWhen the proposal came for my marriage, an astrologer was sent,\r\nwho consulted my palm and said, \"This girl has good signs.  She\r\nwill become an ideal wife.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the women who heard it said: \"No wonder, for she\r\nresembles her mother.\"\r\n\r\nI was married into a Rajah's house.  When I was a child, I was\r\nquite familiar with the description of the Prince of the fairy\r\nstory.  But my husband's face was not of a kind that one's\r\nimagination would place in fairyland.  It was dark, even as mine\r\nwas.  The feeling of shrinking, which I had about my own lack of\r\nphysical beauty, was lifted a little; at the same time a touch of\r\nregret was left lingering in my heart.\r\n\r\nBut when the physical appearance evades the scrutiny of our\r\nsenses and enters the sanctuary of our hearts, then it can forget\r\nitself.  I know, from my childhood's experience, how devotion is\r\nbeauty itself, in its inner aspect.  When my mother arranged the\r\ndifferent fruits, carefully peeled by her own loving hands, on\r\nthe white stone plate, and gently waved her fan to drive away the\r\nflies while my father sat down to his meals, her service would\r\nlose itself in a beauty which passed beyond outward forms.  Even\r\nin my infancy I could feel its power.  It transcended all\r\ndebates, or doubts, or calculations: it was pure music.\r\n\r\nI distinctly remember after my marriage, when, early in the\r\nmorning, I would cautiously and silently get up and take the dust\r\n[3] of my husband's feet without waking him, how at such moments\r\nI could feel the vermilion mark upon my forehead shining out like\r\nthe morning star.\r\n\r\nOne day, he happened to awake, and smiled as he asked me: \"What\r\nis that, Bimala?  What __are__ you doing?\"\r\n\r\nI can never forget the shame of being detected by him.  He might\r\npossibly have thought that I was trying to earn merit secretly.\r\nBut no, no!  That had nothing to do with merit.  It was my\r\nwoman's heart, which must worship in order to love.\r\n\r\nMy father-in-law's house was old in dignity from the days of the\r\n__Badshahs__.  Some of its manners were of the Moguls and\r\nPathans, some of its customs of Manu and Parashar.  But my\r\nhusband was absolutely modern.  He was the first of the house to\r\ngo through a college course and take his M.A.  degree.  His elder\r\nbrother had died young, of drink, and had left no children.  My\r\nhusband did not drink and was not given to dissipation.  So\r\nforeign to the family was this abstinence, that to many it hardly\r\nseemed decent!  Purity, they imagined, was only becoming in those\r\non whom fortune had not smiled.  It is the moon which has room\r\nfor stains, not the stars.\r\n\r\nMy husband's parents had died long ago, and his old grandmother\r\nwas mistress of the house.  My husband was the apple of her eye,\r\nthe jewel on her bosom.  And so he never met with much difficulty\r\nin overstepping any of the ancient usages.  When he brought in\r\nMiss Gilby, to teach me and be my companion, he stuck to his\r\nresolve in spite of the poison secreted by all the wagging\r\ntongues at home and outside.\r\n\r\nMy husband had then just got through his B.A.  examination and\r\nwas reading for his M.A.  degree; so he had to stay in Calcutta\r\nto attend college.  He used to write to me almost every day, a\r\nfew lines only, and simple words, but his bold, round handwriting\r\nwould look up into my face, oh, so tenderly!  I kept his letters\r\nin a sandalwood box and covered them every day with the flowers I\r\ngathered in the garden.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Prince of the fairy tale had faded, like the\r\nmoon in the morning light.  I had the Prince of my real world\r\nenthroned in my heart.  I was his queen.  I had my seat by his\r\nside.  But my real joy was, that my true place was at his feet.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have been educated, and introduced to the modern\r\nage in its own language, and therefore these words that I write\r\nseem to blush with shame in their prose setting.  Except for my\r\nacquaintance with this modern standard of life, I should know,\r\nquite naturally, that just as my being born a woman was not in my\r\nown hands, so the element of devotion in woman's love is not like\r\na hackneyed passage quoted from a romantic poem to be piously\r\nwritten down in round hand in a school-girl's copy-book.\r\n\r\nBut my husband would not give me any opportunity for worship.\r\nThat was his greatness.  They are cowards who claim absolute\r\ndevotion from their wives as their right; that is a humiliation\r\nfor both.\r\n\r\nHis love for me seemed to overflow my limits by its flood of\r\nwealth and service.  But my necessity was more for giving than\r\nfor receiving; for love is a vagabond, who can make his flowers\r\nbloom in the wayside dust, better than in the crystal jars kept\r\nin the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMy husband could not break completely with the old-time\r\ntraditions which prevailed in our family.  It was difficult,\r\ntherefore, for us to meet at any hour of the day we pleased.  [4]\r\nI knew exactly the time that he could come to me, and therefore\r\nour meeting had all the care of loving preparation.  It was like\r\nthe rhyming of a poem; it had to come through the path of the\r\nmetre.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the day's work and taking my afternoon bath, I\r\nwould do up my hair and renew my vermilion mark and put on my\r\n__sari__, carefully crinkled; and then, bringing back my body\r\nand mind from all distractions of household duties, I would\r\ndedicate it at this special hour, with special ceremonies, to one\r\nindividual.  That time, each day, with him was short; but it was\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nMy husband used to say, that man and wife are equal in love\r\nbecause of their equal claim on each other.  I never argued the\r\npoint with him, but my heart said that devotion never stands in\r\nthe way of true equality; it only raises the level of the ground\r\nof meeting.  Therefore the joy of the higher equality remains\r\npermanent; it never slides down to the vulgar level of triviality.\r\n\r\nMy beloved, it was worthy of you that you never expected worship\r\nfrom me.  But if you had accepted it, you would have done me a\r\nreal service.  You showed your love by decorating me, by\r\neducating me, by giving me what I asked for, and what I did not.\r\nI have seen what depth of love there was in your eyes when you\r\ngazed at me.  I have known the secret sigh of pain you suppressed\r\nin your love for me.  You loved my body as if it were a flower of\r\nparadise.  You loved my whole nature as if it had been given you\r\nby some rare providence.\r\n\r\nSuch lavish devotion made me proud to think that the wealth was\r\nall my own which drove you to my gate.  But vanity such as this\r\nonly checks the flow of free surrender in a woman's love.  When I\r\nsit on the queen's throne and claim homage, then the claim only\r\ngoes on magnifying itself; it is never satisfied.  Can there be\r\nany real happiness for a woman in merely feeling that she has\r\npower over a man?  To surrender one's pride in devotion is\r\nwoman's only salvation.\r\n\r\nIt comes back to me today how, in the days of our happiness, the\r\nfires of envy sprung up all around us.  That was only natural,\r\nfor had I not stepped into my good fortune by a mere chance, and\r\nwithout deserving it?  But providence does not allow a run of\r\nluck to last for ever, unless its debt of honour be fully paid,\r\nday by day, through many a long day, and thus made secure.  God\r\nmay grant us gifts, but the merit of being able to take and hold\r\nthem must be our own.  Alas for the boons that slip through\r\nunworthy hands!\r\n\r\nMy husband's grandmother and mother were both renowned for their\r\nbeauty.  And my widowed sister-in-law was also of a beauty rarely\r\nto be seen.  When, in turn, fate left them desolate, the\r\ngrandmother vowed she would not insist on having beauty for her\r\nremaining grandson when he married.  Only the auspicious marks\r\nwith which I was endowed gained me an entry into this family--\r\notherwise, I had no claim to be here.\r\n\r\nIn this house of luxury, but few of its ladies had received their\r\nmeed of respect.  They had, however, got used to the ways of the\r\nfamily, and managed to keep their heads above water, buoyed up by\r\ntheir dignity as __Ranis__ of an ancient house, in spite of\r\ntheir daily tears being drowned in the foam of wine, and by the\r\ntinkle of the \"dancing girls\" anklets.  Was the credit due to me\r\nthat my husband did not touch liquor, nor squander his manhood in\r\nthe markets of woman's flesh?  What charm did I know to soothe\r\nthe wild and wandering mind of men?  It was my good luck, nothing\r\nelse.  For fate proved utterly callous to my sister-in-law.  Her\r\nfestivity died out, while yet the evening was early, leaving the\r\nlight of her beauty shining in vain over empty halls--burning and\r\nburning, with no accompanying music!\r\n\r\nHis sister-in-law affected a contempt for my husband's modern\r\nnotions.  How absurd to keep the family ship, laden with all the\r\nweight of its time-honoured glory, sailing under the colours of\r\nhis slip of a girl-wife alone!  Often have I felt the lash of\r\nscorn.  \"A thief who had stolen a husband's love!\"  \"A sham\r\nhidden in the shamelessness of her new-fangled finery!\"  The\r\nmany-coloured garments of modern fashion with which my husband\r\nloved to adorn me roused jealous wrath.  \"Is not she ashamed to\r\nmake a show-window of herself--and with her looks, too!\"\r\n\r\nMy husband was aware of all this, but his gentleness knew no\r\nbounds.  He used to implore me to forgive her.\r\n\r\nI remember I once told him: \"Women's minds are so petty, so\r\ncrooked!\"  \"Like the feet of Chinese women,\" he replied.  \"Has\r\nnot the pressure of society cramped them into pettiness and\r\ncrookedness?  They are but pawns of the fate which gambles with\r\nthem.  What responsibility have they of their own?\"\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law never failed to get from my husband whatever she\r\nwanted.  He did not stop to consider whether her requests were\r\nright or reasonable.  But what exasperated me most was that she\r\nwas not grateful for this.  I had promised my husband that I\r\nwould not talk back at her, but this set me raging all the more,\r\ninwardly.  I used to feel that goodness has a limit, which, if\r\npassed, somehow seems to make men cowardly.  Shall I tell the\r\nwhole truth?  I have often wished that my husband had the\r\nmanliness to be a little less good.\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law, the Bara Rani, [5] was still young and had no\r\npretensions to saintliness.  Rather, her talk and jest and laugh\r\ninclined to be forward.  The young maids with whom she surrounded\r\nherself were also impudent to a degree.  But there was none to\r\ngainsay her--for was not this the custom of the house?  It seemed\r\nto me that my good fortune in having a stainless husband was a\r\nspecial eyesore to her.  He, however, felt more the sorrow of her\r\nlot than the defects of her character.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n1. The mark of Hindu wifehood and the symbol of all the devotion\r\nthat it implies.\r\n\r\n2. The __sari__ is the dress of the Hindu woman.\r\n\r\n3. Taking the dust of the feet is a formal offering of reverence\r\nand is done by lightly touching the feet of the revered one and\r\nthen one's own head with the same hand.  The wife does not\r\nordinarily do this to the husband.\r\n\r\n4. It would not be reckoned good form for the husband to be\r\ncontinually going into the zenana, except at particular hours for\r\nmeals or rest.\r\n\r\n5. __Bara__ = Senior; __Chota__ = Junior.  In joint\r\nfamilies of rank, though the widows remain entitled only to a\r\nlife-interest in their husbands' share, their rank remains to\r\nthem according to seniority, and the titles \"Senior\" and \"Junior\"\r\ncontinue to distinguish the elder and younger branches, even\r\nthough the junior branch be the one in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy husband was very eager to take me out of __purdah__.  [6]\r\n\r\nOne day I said to him: \"What do I want with the outside world?\"\r\n\r\n\"The outside world may want you,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"If the outside world has got on so long without me, it may go on\r\nfor some time longer.  It need not pine to death for want of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it perish, for all I care!  That is not troubling me.  I am\r\nthinking about myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed.  Tell me what about yourself?\"\r\n\r\nMy husband was silent, with a smile.\r\n\r\nI knew his way, and protested at once: \"No, no, you are not going\r\nto run away from me like that!  I want to have this out with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can one ever finish a subject with words?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do stop speaking in riddles.  Tell me...\"\r\n\r\n\"What I want is, that I should have you, and you should have me,\r\nmore fully in the outside world.  That is where we are still in\r\ndebt to each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is anything wanting, then, in the love we have here at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are wrapped up in me.  You know neither what you have,\r\nnor what you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot bear to hear you talk like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have you come into the heart of the outer world and meet\r\nreality.  Merely going on with your household duties, living all\r\nyour life in the world of household conventions and the drudgery\r\nof household tasks--you were not made for that!  If we meet, and\r\nrecognize each other, in the real world, then only will our love\r\nbe true.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there be any drawback here to our full recognition of each\r\nother, then I have nothing to say.  But as for myself, I feel no\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, even if the drawback is only on my side, why shouldn't you\r\nhelp to remove it?\"\r\n\r\nSuch discussions repeatedly occurred.  One day he said: \"The\r\ngreedy man who is fond of his fish stew has no compunction in\r\ncutting up the fish according to his need.  But the man who loves\r\nthe fish wants to enjoy it in the water; and if that is\r\nimpossible he waits on the bank; and even if he comes back home\r\nwithout a sight of it he has the consolation of knowing that the\r\nfish is all right.  Perfect gain is the best of all; but if that\r\nis impossible, then the next best gain is perfect losing.\"\r\n\r\nI never liked the way my husband had of talking on this subject,\r\nbut that is not the reason why I refused to leave the zenana.\r\nHis grandmother was still alive.  My husband had filled more than\r\na hundred and twenty per cent of the house with the twentieth\r\ncentury, against her taste; but she had borne it uncomplaining.\r\nShe would have borne it, likewise, if the daughter-in-law [7] of\r\nthe Rajah's house had left its seclusion.  She was even prepared\r\nfor this happening.  But I did not consider it important enough\r\nto give her the pain of it.  I have read in books that we are\r\ncalled \"caged birds\".  I cannot speak for others, but I had so\r\nmuch in this cage of mine that there was not room for it in the\r\nuniverse--at least that is what I then felt.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother, in her old age, was very fond of me.  At the\r\nbottom of her fondness was the thought that, with the conspiracy\r\nof favourable stars which attended me, I had been able to attract\r\nmy husband's love.  Were not men naturally inclined to plunge\r\ndownwards?  None of the others, for all their beauty, had been\r\nable to prevent their husbands going headlong into the burning\r\ndepths which consumed and destroyed them.  She believed that I\r\nhad been the means of extinguishing this fire, so deadly to the\r\nmen of the family.  So she kept me in the shelter of her bosom,\r\nand trembled if I was in the least bit unwell.\r\n\r\nHis grandmother did not like the dresses and ornaments my husband\r\nbrought from European shops to deck me with.  But she reflected:\r\n\"Men will have some absurd hobby or other, which is sure to be\r\nexpensive.  It is no use trying to check their extravagance; one\r\nis glad enough if they stop short of ruin.  If my Nikhil had not\r\nbeen busy dressing up his wife there is no knowing whom else he\r\nmight have spent his money on!\"  So whenever any new dress of\r\nmine arrived she used to send for my husband and make merry over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that it was her taste which changed.  The\r\ninfluence of the modern age fell so strongly upon her, that her\r\nevenings refused to pass if I did not tell her stories out of\r\nEnglish books.\r\n\r\nAfter his grandmother's death, my husband wanted me to go and\r\nlive with him in Calcutta.  But I could not bring myself to do\r\nthat.  Was not this our House, which she had kept under her\r\nsheltering care through all her trials and troubles?  Would not a\r\ncurse come upon me if I deserted it and went off to town?  This\r\nwas the thought that kept me back, as her empty seat\r\nreproachfully looked up at me.  That noble lady had come into\r\nthis house at the age of eight, and had died in her seventy-ninth\r\nyear.  She had not spent a happy life.  Fate had hurled shaft\r\nafter shaft at her breast, only to draw out more and more the\r\nimperishable spirit within.  This great house was hallowed with\r\nher tears.  What should I do in the dust of Calcutta, away from\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMy husband's idea was that this would be a good opportunity for\r\nleaving to my sister-in-law the consolation of ruling over the\r\nhousehold, giving our life, at the same time, more room to branch\r\nout in Calcutta.  That is just where my difficulty came in.  She\r\nhad worried my life out, she ill brooked my husband's happiness,\r\nand for this she was to be rewarded!  And what of the day when we\r\nshould have to come back here?  Should I then get back my seat at\r\nthe head?\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with that seat?\"  my husband would say.  \"Are\r\nthere not more precious things in life?\"\r\n\r\nMen never understand these things.  They have their nests in the\r\noutside world; they little know the whole of what the household\r\nstands for.  In these matters they ought to follow womanly\r\nguidance.  Such were my thoughts at that time.\r\n\r\nI felt the real point was, that one ought to stand up for one's\r\nrights.  To go away, and leave everything in the hands of the\r\nenemy, would be nothing short of owning defeat.\r\n\r\nBut why did not my husband compel me to go with him to Calcutta?\r\nI know the reason.  He did not use his power, just because he had\r\nit.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n6. The seclusion of the zenana, and all the customs peculiar to\r\nit, are designated by the general term \"Purdah\", which means\r\nScreen.\r\n\r\n7. The prestige of the daughter-in-law is of the first importance\r\nin a Hindu household of rank [Trans.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIF one had to fill in, little by little, the gap between day and\r\nnight, it would take an eternity to do it.  But the sun rises and\r\nthe darkness is dispelled--a moment is sufficient to overcome an\r\ninfinite distance.\r\n\r\nOne day there came the new era of __Swadeshi__ [8] in Bengal;\r\nbut as to how it happened, we had no distinct vision.  There was\r\nno gradual slope connecting the past with the present.  For that\r\nreason, I imagine, the new epoch came in like a flood, breaking\r\ndown the dykes and sweeping all our prudence and fear before it.\r\nWe had no time even to think about, or understand, what had\r\nhappened, or what was about to happen.\r\n\r\nMy sight and my mind, my hopes and my desires, became red with\r\nthe passion of this new age.  Though, up to this time, the walls\r\nof the home--which was the ultimate world to my mind--remained\r\nunbroken, yet I stood looking over into the distance, and I heard\r\na voice from the far horizon, whose meaning was not perfectly\r\nclear to me, but whose call went straight to my heart.\r\n\r\nFrom the time my husband had been a college student he had been\r\ntrying to get the things required by our people produced in our\r\nown country.  There are plenty of date trees in our district.  He\r\ntried to invent an apparatus for extracting the juice and boiling\r\nit into sugar and treacle.  I heard that it was a great success,\r\nonly it extracted more money than juice.  After a while he came\r\nto the conclusion that our attempts at reviving our industries\r\nwere not succeeding for want of a bank of our own.  He was, at\r\nthe time, trying to teach me political economy.  This alone would\r\nnot have done much harm, but he also took it into his head to\r\nteach his countrymen ideas of thrift, so as to pave the way for a\r\nbank; and then he actually started a small bank.  Its high rate\r\nof interest, which made the villagers flock so enthusiastically\r\nto put in their money, ended by swamping the bank altogether.\r\n\r\nThe old officers of the estate felt troubled and frightened.\r\nThere was jubilation in the enemy's camp.  Of all the family,\r\nonly my husband's grandmother remained unmoved.  She would scold\r\nme, saying: \"Why are you all plaguing him so?  Is it the fate of\r\nthe estate that is worrying you?  How many times have I seen this\r\nestate in the hands of the court receiver!  Are men like women?\r\nMen are born spendthrifts and only know how to waste.  Look here,\r\nchild, count yourself fortunate that your husband is not wasting\r\nhimself as well!\"\r\n\r\nMy husband's list of charities was a long one.  He would assist\r\nto the bitter end of utter failure anyone who wanted to invent a\r\nnew loom or rice-husking machine.  But what annoyed me most was\r\nthe way that Sandip Babu [9] used to fleece him on the pretext of\r\n__Swadeshi__ work.  Whenever he wanted to start a newspaper,\r\nor travel about preaching the Cause, or take a change of air by\r\nthe advice of his doctor, my husband would unquestioningly supply\r\nhim with the money.  This was over and above the regular living\r\nallowance which Sandip Babu also received from him.  The\r\nstrangest part of it was that my husband and Sandip Babu did not\r\nagree in their opinions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the __Swadeshi__ storm reached my blood, I said to\r\nmy husband: \"I must burn all my foreign clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why burn them?\"  said he.  \"You need not wear them as long as\r\nyou please.\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as I please!  Not in this life ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, do not wear them for the rest of your life, then.\r\nBut why this bonfire business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you thwart me in my resolve?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I want to say is this: Why not try to build up something?\r\nYou should not waste even a tenth part of your energies in this\r\ndestructive excitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such excitement will give us the energy to build.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as much as to say, that you cannot light the house\r\nunless you set fire to it.\"\r\n\r\nThen there came another trouble.  When Miss Gilby first came to\r\nour house there was a great flutter, which afterwards calmed down\r\nwhen they got used to her.  Now the whole thing was stirred up\r\nafresh.  I had never bothered myself before as to whether Miss\r\nGilby was European or Indian, but I began to do so now.  I said\r\nto my husband: \"We must get rid of Miss Gilby.\"\r\n\r\nHe kept silent.\r\n\r\nI talked to him wildly, and he went away sad at heart.\r\n\r\nAfter a fit of weeping, I felt in a more reasonable mood when we\r\nmet at night.  \"I cannot,\" my husband said, \"look upon Miss Gilby\r\nthrough a mist of abstraction, just because she is English.\r\nCannot you get over the barrier of her name after such a long\r\nacquaintance?  Cannot you realize that she loves you?\"\r\n\r\nI felt a little ashamed and replied with some sharpness: \"Let her\r\nremain.  I am not over anxious to send her away.\"  And Miss Gilby\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nBut one day I was told that she had been insulted by a young\r\nfellow on her way to church.  This was a boy whom we were\r\nsupporting.  My husband turned him out of the house.  There was\r\nnot a single soul, that day, who could forgive my husband for\r\nthat act--not even I.  This time Miss Gilby left of her own\r\naccord.  She shed tears when she came to say good-bye, but my\r\nmood would not melt.  To slander the poor boy so--and such a fine\r\nboy, too, who would forget his daily bath and food in his\r\nenthusiasm for __Swadeshi__.\r\n\r\nMy husband escorted Miss Gilby to the railway station in his own\r\ncarriage.  I was sure he was going too far.  When exaggerated\r\naccounts of the incident gave rise to a public scandal, which\r\nfound its way to the newspapers, I felt he had been rightly\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nI had often become anxious at my husband's doings, but had never\r\nbefore been ashamed; yet now I had to blush for him!  I did not\r\nknow exactly, nor did I care, what wrong poor Noren might, or\r\nmight not, have done to Miss Gilby, but the idea of sitting in\r\njudgement on such a matter at such a time!  I should have refused\r\nto damp the spirit which prompted young Noren to defy the\r\nEnglishwoman.  I could not but look upon it as a sign of\r\ncowardice in my husband, that he should fail to understand this\r\nsimple thing.  And so I blushed for him.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not that my husband refused to support\r\n__Swadeshi__, or was in any way against the Cause.  Only he\r\nhad not been able whole-heartedly to accept the spirit of\r\n__Bande Mataram__.  [10]\r\n\r\n\"I am willing,\" he said, \"to serve my country; but my worship I\r\nreserve for Right which is far greater than my country.  To\r\nworship my country as a god is to bring a curse upon it.\"\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n8. The Nationalist movement, which began more as an economic than\r\na political one, having as its main object the encouragement of\r\nindigenous industries [Trans.].\r\n\r\n9. \"Babu\" is a term of respect, like \"Father\" or \"Mister,\" but\r\nhas also meant in colonial days a person who understands some\r\nEnglish.  [on-line ed.]\r\n\r\n10. Lit.: \"Hail Mother\"; the opening words of a song by Bankim\r\nChatterjee, the famous Bengali novelist.  The song has now become\r\nthe national anthem, and __Bande Mataram__ the national cry,\r\nsince the days of the __Swadeshi__ movement [Trans.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Two\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS was the time when Sandip Babu with his followers came to our\r\nneighbourhood to preach __Swadeshi__.\r\n\r\nThere is to be a big meeting in our temple pavilion.  We women\r\nare sitting there, on one side, behind a screen.  Triumphant\r\nshouts of __Bande Mataram__ come nearer: and to them I am\r\nthrilling through and through.  Suddenly a stream of barefooted\r\nyouths in turbans, clad in ascetic ochre, rushes into the\r\nquadrangle, like a silt-reddened freshet into a dry river-bed at\r\nthe first burst of the rains.  The whole place is filled with an\r\nimmense crowd, through which Sandip Babu is borne, seated in a\r\nbig chair hoisted on the shoulders of ten or twelve of the\r\nyouths.\r\n\r\n__Bande Mataram!  Bande Mataram!  Bande Mataram__!  It seems\r\nas though the skies would be rent and scattered into a thousand\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nI had seen Sandip Babu's photograph before.  There was something\r\nin his features which I did not quite like.  Not that he was bad-\r\nlooking--far from it: he had a splendidly handsome face.  Yet, I\r\nknow not why, it seemed to me, in spite of all its brilliance,\r\nthat too much of base alloy had gone into its making.  The light\r\nin his eyes somehow did not shine true.  That was why I did not\r\nlike it when my husband unquestioningly gave in to all his\r\ndemands.  I could bear the waste of money; but it vexed me to\r\nthink that he was imposing on my husband, taking advantage of\r\nfriendship.  His bearing was not that of an ascetic, nor even of\r\na person of moderate means, but foppish all over.  Love of\r\ncomfort seemed to ...  any number of such reflections come back\r\nto me today, but let them be.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Sandip Babu began to speak that afternoon, and the\r\nhearts of the crowd swayed and surged to his words, as though\r\nthey would break all bounds, I saw him wonderfully transformed.\r\nEspecially when his features were suddenly lit up by a shaft of\r\nlight from the slowly setting sun, as it sunk below the roof-line\r\nof the pavilion, he seemed to me to be marked out by the gods as\r\ntheir messenger to mortal men and women.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end of his speech, each one of his utterances\r\nwas a stormy outburst.  There was no limit to the confidence of\r\nhis assurance.  I do not know how it happened, but I found I had\r\nimpatiently pushed away the screen from before me and had fixed\r\nmy gaze upon him.  Yet there was none in that crowd who paid any\r\nheed to my doings.  Only once, I noticed, his eyes, like stars in\r\nfateful Orion, flashed full on my face.\r\n\r\nI was utterly unconscious of myself.  I was no longer the lady of\r\nthe Rajah's house, but the sole representative of Bengal's\r\nwomanhood.  And he was the champion of Bengal.  As the sky had\r\nshed its light over him, so he must receive the consecration of a\r\nwoman's benediction ...\r\n\r\nIt seemed clear to me that, since he had caught sight of me, the\r\nfire in his words had flamed up more fiercely.  Indra's [11]\r\nsteed refused to be reined in, and there came the roar of thunder\r\nand the flash of lightning.  I said within myself that his\r\nlanguage had caught fire from my eyes; for we women are not only\r\nthe deities of the household fire, but the flame of the soul\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI returned home that evening radiant with a new pride and joy.\r\nThe storm within me had shifted my whole being from one centre to\r\nanother.  Like the Greek maidens of old, I fain would cut off my\r\nlong, resplendent tresses to make a bowstring for my hero.  Had\r\nmy outward ornaments been connected with my inner feelings, then\r\nmy necklet, my armlets, my bracelets, would all have burst their\r\nbonds and flung themselves over that assembly like a shower of\r\nmeteors.  Only some personal sacrifice, I felt, could help me to\r\nbear the tumult of my exaltation.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband came home later, I was trembling lest he should\r\nutter a sound out of tune with the triumphant paean which was\r\nstill ringing in my ears, lest his fanaticism for truth should\r\nlead him to express disapproval of anything that had been said\r\nthat afternoon.  For then I should have openly defied and\r\nhumiliated him.  But he did not say a word ...  which I did not\r\nlike either.\r\n\r\nHe should have said: \"Sandip has brought me to my senses.  I now\r\nrealize how mistaken I have been all this time.\"\r\n\r\nI somehow felt that he was spitefully silent, that he obstinately\r\nrefused to be enthusiastic.  I asked how long Sandip Babu was\r\ngoing to be with us.\r\n\r\n\"He is off to Rangpur early tomorrow morning,\" said my husband.\r\n\r\n\"Must it be tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he is already engaged to speak there.\"\r\n\r\nI was silent for a while and then asked again: \"Could he not\r\npossibly stay a day longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"That may hardly be possible, but why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to invite him to dinner and attend on him myself.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband was surprised.  He had often entreated me to be\r\npresent when he had particular friends to dinner, but I had never\r\nlet myself be persuaded.  He gazed at me curiously, in silence,\r\nwith a look I did not quite understand.\r\n\r\nI was suddenly overcome with a sense of shame.  \"No, no,\" I\r\nexclaimed, \"that would never do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not!\"  said he.  \"I will ask him myself, and if it is at all\r\npossible he will surely stay on for tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be quite possible.\r\n\r\nI will tell the exact truth.  That day I reproached my Creator\r\nbecause he had not made me surpassingly beautiful--not to steal\r\nany heart away, but because beauty is glory.  In this great day\r\nthe men of the country should realize its goddess in its\r\nwomanhood.  But, alas, the eyes of men fail to discern the\r\ngoddess, if outward beauty be lacking.  Would Sandip Babu find\r\nthe __Shakti__ of the Motherland manifest in me?  Or would he\r\nsimply take me to be an ordinary, domestic woman?\r\n\r\nThat morning I scented my flowing hair and tied it in a loose\r\nknot, bound by a cunningly intertwined red silk ribbon.  Dinner,\r\nyou see, was to be served at midday, and there was no time to dry\r\nmy hair after my bath and do it up plaited in the ordinary way.\r\nI put on a gold-bordered white __sari__, and my short-sleeve\r\nmuslin jacket was also gold-bordered.\r\n\r\nI felt that there was a certain restraint about my costume and\r\nthat nothing could well have been simpler.  But my sister-in-law,\r\nwho happened to be passing by, stopped dead before me, surveyed\r\nme from head to foot and with compressed lips smiled a meaning\r\nsmile.  When I asked her the reason, \"I am admiring your get-up!\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"What is there so entertaining about it?\"  I enquired,\r\nconsiderably annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"It's superb,\" she said.  \"I was only thinking that one of those\r\nlow-necked English bodices would have made it perfect.\"  Not only\r\nher mouth and eyes, but her whole body seemed to ripple with\r\nsuppressed laughter as she left the room.\r\n\r\nI was very, very angry, and wanted to change everything and put\r\non my everyday clothes.  But I cannot tell exactly why I could\r\nnot carry out my impulse.  Women are the ornaments of society--\r\nthus I reasoned with myself--and my husband would never like it,\r\nif I appeared before Sandip Babu unworthily clad.\r\n\r\nMy idea had been to make my appearance after they had sat down to\r\ndinner.  In the bustle of looking after the serving the first\r\nawkwardness would have passed off.  But dinner was not ready in\r\ntime, and it was getting late.  Meanwhile my husband had sent for\r\nme to introduce the guest.\r\n\r\nI was feeling horribly shy about looking Sandip Babu in the face.\r\nHowever, I managed to recover myself enough to say: \"I am so\r\nsorry dinner is getting late.\"\r\n\r\nHe boldly came and sat right beside me as he replied: \"I get a\r\ndinner of some kind every day, but the Goddess of Plenty keeps\r\nbehind the scenes.  Now that the goddess herself has appeared, it\r\nmatters little if the dinner lags behind.\"\r\n\r\nHe was just as emphatic in his manners as he was in his public\r\nspeaking.  He had no hesitation and seemed to be accustomed to\r\noccupy, unchallenged, his chosen seat.  He claimed the right to\r\nintimacy so confidently, that the blame would seem to belong to\r\nthose who should dispute it.\r\n\r\nI was in terror lest Sandip Babu should take me for a shrinking,\r\nold-fashioned bundle of inanity.  But, for the life of me, I\r\ncould not sparkle in repartees such as might charm or dazzle him.\r\nWhat could have possessed me, I angrily wondered, to appear\r\nbefore him in such an absurd way?\r\n\r\nI was about to retire when dinner was over, but Sandip Babu, as\r\nbold as ever, placed himself in my way.\r\n\r\n\"You must not,\" he said, \"think me greedy.  It was not the dinner\r\nthat kept me staying on, it was your invitation.  If you were to\r\nrun away now, that would not be playing fair with your guest.\"\r\n\r\nIf he had not said these words with a careless ease, they would\r\nhave been out of tune.  But, after all, he was such a great\r\nfriend of my husband that I was like his sister.\r\n\r\nWhile I was struggling to climb up this high wave of intimacy, my\r\nhusband came to the rescue, saying: \"Why not come back to us\r\nafter you have taken your dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must give your word,\" said Sandip Babu, \"before we let\r\nyou off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come,\" said I, with a slight smile.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you,\" continued Sandip Babu, \"why I cannot trust\r\nyou.  Nikhil has been married these nine years, and all this\r\nwhile you have eluded me.  If you do this again for another nine\r\nyears, we shall never meet again.\"\r\n\r\nI took up the spirit of his remark as I dropped my voice to\r\nreply: \"Why even then should we not meet?\"\r\n\r\n\"My horoscope tells me I am to die early.  None of my forefathers\r\nhave survived their thirtieth year.  I am now twenty-seven.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew this would go home.  This time there must have been a\r\nshade of concern in my low voice as I said: \"The blessings of the\r\nwhole country are sure to avert the evil influence of the stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the blessings of the country must be voiced by its goddess.\r\nThis is the reason for my anxiety that you should return, so that\r\nmy talisman may begin to work from today.\"\r\n\r\nSandip Babu had such a way of taking things by storm that I got\r\nno opportunity of resenting what I never should have permitted in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he concluded with a laugh, \"I am going to hold this husband\r\nof yours as a hostage till you come back.\"\r\n\r\nAs I was coming away, he exclaimed: \"May I trouble you for a\r\ntrifle?\"\r\n\r\nI started and turned round.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" he said.  \"It's merely a glass of water.  You\r\nmight have noticed that I did not drink any water with my dinner.\r\nI take it a little later.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this I had to make a show of interest and ask him the\r\nreason.  He began to give the history of his dyspepsia.  I was\r\ntold how he had been a martyr to it for seven months, and how,\r\nafter the usual course of nuisances, which included different\r\nallopathic and homoeopathic misadventures, he had obtained the\r\nmost wonderful results by indigenous methods.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he added, with a smile, \"God has built even my\r\ninfirmities in such a manner that they yield only under the\r\nbombardment of __Swadeshi__ pills.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband, at this, broke his silence.  \"You must confess,\" said\r\nhe, \"that you have as immense an attraction for foreign medicine\r\nas the earth has for meteors.  You have three shelves in your\r\nsitting-room full of...\"\r\n\r\nSandip Babu broke in: \"Do you know what they are?  They are the\r\npunitive police.  They come, not because they are wanted, but\r\nbecause they are imposed on us by the rule of this modern age,\r\nexacting fines and-inflicting injuries.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband could not bear exaggerations, and I could see he\r\ndisliked this.  But all ornaments are exaggerations.  They are\r\nnot made by God, but by man.  Once I remember in defence of some\r\nuntruth of mine I said to my husband: \"Only the trees and beasts\r\nand birds tell unmitigated truths, because these poor things have\r\nnot the power to invent.  In this men show their superiority to\r\nthe lower creatures, and women beat even men.  Neither is a\r\nprofusion of ornament unbecoming for a woman, nor a profusion of\r\nuntruth.\"\r\n\r\nAs I came out into the passage leading to the zenana I found my\r\nsister-in-law, standing near a window overlooking the reception\r\nrooms, peeping through the venetian shutter.\r\n\r\n\"You here?\"  I asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Eavesdropping!\"  she replied.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n11. The Jupiter Pluvius of Hindu mythology.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I returned, Sandip Babu was tenderly apologetic.  \"I am\r\nafraid we have spoilt your appetite,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI felt greatly ashamed.  Indeed, I had been too indecently quick\r\nover my dinner.  With a little calculation, it would become quite\r\nevident that my non-eating had surpassed the eating.  But I had\r\nno idea that anyone could have been deliberately calculating.\r\n\r\nI suppose Sandip Babu detected my feeling of shame, which only\r\naugmented it.  \"I was sure,\" he said, \"that you had the impulse\r\nof the wild deer to run away, but it is a great boon that you\r\ntook the trouble to keep your promise with me.\"\r\n\r\nI could not think of any suitable reply and so I sat down,\r\nblushing and uncomfortable, at one end of the sofa.  The vision\r\nthat I had of myself, as the __Shakti__ of Womanhood,\r\nincarnate, crowning Sandip Babu simply with my presence, majestic\r\nand unashamed, failed me altogether.\r\n\r\nSandip Babu deliberately started a discussion with my husband.\r\nHe knew that his keen wit flashed to the best effect in an\r\nargument.  I have often since observed, that he never lost an\r\nopportunity for a passage at arms whenever I happened to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHe was familiar with my husband's views on the cult of __Bande\r\nMataram__, and began in a provoking way: \"So you do not allow\r\nthat there is room for an appeal to the imagination in patriotic\r\nwork?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has its place, Sandip, I admit, but I do not believe in\r\ngiving it the whole place.  I would know my country in its frank\r\nreality, and for this I am both afraid and ashamed to make use of\r\nhypnotic texts of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you call hypnotic texts I call truth.  I truly believe my\r\ncountry to be my God.  I worship Humanity.  God manifests Himself\r\nboth in man and in his country.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is what you really believe, there should be no\r\ndifference for you between man and man, and so between country\r\nand country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true.  But my powers are limited, so my worship of\r\nHumanity is continued in the worship of my country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing against your worship as such, but how is it you\r\npropose to conduct your worship of God by hating other countries\r\nin which He is equally manifest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate is also an adjunct of worship.  Arjuna won Mahadeva's\r\nfavour by wrestling with him.  God will be with us in the end, if\r\nwe are prepared to give Him battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that be so, then those who are serving and those who are\r\nharming the country are both His devotees.  Why, then, trouble to\r\npreach patriotism?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the case of one's own country, it is different.  There the\r\nheart clearly demands worship.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you push the same argument further you can say that since God\r\nis manifested in us, our __self__ has to be worshipped before\r\nall else; because our natural instinct claims it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Nikhil, this is all merely dry logic.  Can't you\r\nrecognize that there is such a thing as feeling?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you the truth, Sandip,\" my husband replied.  \"It is my\r\nfeelings that are outraged, whenever you try to pass off\r\ninjustice as a duty, and unrighteousness as a moral ideal.  The\r\nfact, that I am incapable of stealing, is not due to my\r\npossessing logical faculties, but to my having some feeling of\r\nrespect for myself and love for ideals.\"\r\n\r\nI was raging inwardly.  At last I could keep silent no longer.\r\n\"Is not the history of every country,\" I cried, \"whether England,\r\nFrance, Germany, or Russia, the history of stealing for the sake\r\nof one's own country?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have to answer for these thefts; they are doing so even\r\nnow; their history is not yet ended.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" interposed Sandip Babu, \"why should we not follow\r\nsuit?  Let us first fill our country's coffers with stolen goods\r\nand then take centuries, like these other countries, to answer\r\nfor them, if we must.  But, I ask you, where do you find this\r\n'answering' in history?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Rome was answering for her sin no one knew it.  All that\r\ntime, there was apparently no limit to her prosperity.  But do\r\nyou not see one thing: how these political bags of theirs are\r\nbursting with lies and treacheries, breaking their backs under\r\ntheir weight?\"\r\n\r\nNever before had I had any opportunity of being present at a\r\ndiscussion between my husband and his men friends.  Whenever he\r\nargued with me I could feel his reluctance to push me into a\r\ncorner.  This arose out of the very love he bore me.  Today for\r\nthe first time I saw his fencer's skill in debate.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, my heart refused to accept my husband's position.\r\nI was struggling to find some answer, but it would not come.\r\nWhen the word \"righteousness\" comes into an argument, it sounds\r\nugly to say that a thing can be too good to be useful.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden Sandip Babu turned to me with the question: \"What\r\ndo __you__ say to this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care about fine distinctions,\" I broke out.  \"I will\r\ntell you broadly what I feel.  I am only human.  I am covetous.\r\nI would have good things for my country.  If I am obliged, I\r\nwould snatch them and filch them.  I have anger.  I would be\r\nangry for my country's sake.  If necessary, I would smite and\r\nslay to avenge her insults.  I have my desire to be fascinated,\r\nand fascination must be supplied to me in bodily shape by my\r\ncountry.  She must have some visible symbol casting its spell\r\nupon my mind.  I would make my country a Person, and call her\r\nMother, Goddess, Durga--for whom I would redden the earth with\r\nsacrificial offerings.  I am human, not divine.\"\r\n\r\nSandip Babu leapt to his feet with uplifted arms and shouted\r\n\"Hurrah!\"--The next moment he corrected himself and cried:\r\n\"__Bande Mataram__.\"\r\n\r\nA shadow of pain passed over the face of my husband.  He said to\r\nme in a very gentle voice: \"Neither am I divine: I am human.  And\r\ntherefore I dare not permit the evil which is in me to be\r\nexaggerated into an image of my country--never, never!\"\r\n\r\nSandip Babu cried out: \"See, Nikhil, how in the heart of a woman\r\nTruth takes flesh and blood.  Woman knows how to be cruel: her\r\nvirulence is like a blind storm.  It is beautifully fearful.  In\r\nman it is ugly, because it harbours in its centre the gnawing\r\nworms of reason and thought.  I tell you, Nikhil, it is our women\r\nwho will save the country.  This is not the time for nice\r\nscruples.  We must be unswervingly, unreasoningly brutal.  We\r\nmust sin.  We must give our women red sandal paste with which to\r\nanoint and enthrone our sin.  Don't you remember what the poet\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  Come, Sin, O beautiful Sin,\r\n  Let thy stinging red kisses pour down fiery red wine into our\r\n    blood.\r\n  Sound the trumpet of imperious evil\r\n  And cross our forehead with the wreath of exulting lawlessness,\r\n  O Deity of Desecration,\r\n  Smear our breasts with the blackest mud of disrepute,\r\n    unashamed.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nDown with that righteousness, which cannot smilingly bring rack\r\nand ruin.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Sandip Babu, standing with his head high, insulted at a\r\nmoment's impulse all that men have cherished as their highest, in\r\nall countries and in all times, a shiver went right through my\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut, with a stamp of his foot, he continued his declamation: \"I\r\ncan see that you are that beautiful spirit of fire, which burns\r\nthe home to ashes and lights up the larger world with its flame.\r\nGive to us the indomitable courage to go to the bottom of Ruin\r\nitself.  Impart grace to all that is baneful.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not clear to whom Sandip Babu addressed his last appeal.\r\nIt might have been She whom he worshipped with his __Bande\r\nMataram__.  It might have been the Womanhood of his country.\r\nOr it might have been its representative, the woman before him.\r\nHe would have gone further in the same strain, but my husband\r\nsuddenly rose from his seat and touched him lightly on the\r\nshoulder saying: \"Sandip, Chandranath Babu is here.\"\r\n\r\nI started and turned round, to find an aged gentleman at the\r\ndoor, calm and dignified, in doubt as to whether he should come\r\nin or retire.  His face was touched with a gentle light like that\r\nof the setting sun.\r\n\r\nMy husband came up to me and whispered: \"This is my master, of\r\nwhom I have so often told you.  Make your obeisance to him.\"\r\n\r\nI bent reverently and took the dust of his feet.  He gave me his\r\nblessing saying: \"May God protect you always, my little mother.\"\r\nI was sorely in need of such a blessing at that moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day I had the faith to believe that I should be able to bear\r\nwhatever came from my God.  I never had the trial.  Now I think\r\nit has come.\r\n\r\nI used to test my strength of mind by imagining all kinds of evil\r\nwhich might happen to me--poverty, imprisonment, dishonour,\r\ndeath--even Bimala's.  And when I said to myself that I should be\r\nable to receive these with firmness, I am sure I did not\r\nexaggerate.  Only I could never even imagine one thing, and today\r\nit is that of which I am thinking, and wondering whether I can\r\nreally bear it.  There is a thorn somewhere pricking in my heart,\r\nconstantly giving me pain while I am about my daily work.  It\r\nseems to persist even when I am asleep.  The very moment I wake\r\nup in the morning, I find that the bloom has gone from the face\r\nof the sky.  What is it?  What has happened?\r\n\r\nMy mind has become so sensitive, that even my past life, which\r\ncame to me in the disguise of happiness, seems to wring my very\r\nheart with its falsehood; and the shame and sorrow which are\r\ncoming close to me are losing their cover of privacy, all the\r\nmore because they try to veil their faces.  My heart has become\r\nall eyes.  The things that should not be seen, the things I do\r\nnot want to see--these I must see.\r\n\r\nThe day has come at last when my ill-starred life has to reveal\r\nits destitution in a long-drawn series of exposures.  This\r\npenury, all unexpected, has taken its seat in the heart where\r\nplenitude seemed to reign.  The fees which I paid to delusion for\r\njust nine years of my youth have now to be returned with interest\r\nto Truth till the end of my days.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of straining to keep up my pride?  What harm if I\r\nconfess that I have something lacking in me?  Possibly it is that\r\nunreasoning forcefulness which women love to find in men.  But is\r\nstrength mere display of muscularity?  Must strength have no\r\nscruples in treading the weak underfoot?\r\n\r\nBut why all these arguments?  Worthiness cannot be earned merely\r\nby disputing about it.  And I am unworthy, unworthy, unworthy.\r\n\r\nWhat if I am unworthy?  The true value of love is this, that it\r\ncan ever bless the unworthy with its own prodigality.  For the\r\nworthy there are many rewards on God's earth, but God has\r\nspecially reserved love for the unworthy.\r\n\r\nUp till now Bimala was my home-made Bimala, the product of the\r\nconfined space and the daily routine of small duties.  Did the\r\nlove which I received from her, I asked myself, come from the\r\ndeep spring of her heart, or was it merely like the daily\r\nprovision of pipe water pumped up by the municipal steam-engine\r\nof society?\r\n\r\nI longed to find Bimala blossoming fully in all her truth and\r\npower.  But the thing I forgot to calculate was, that one must\r\ngive up all claims based on conventional rights, if one would\r\nfind a person freely revealed in truth.\r\n\r\nWhy did I fail to think of this?  Was it because of the husband's\r\npride of possession over his wife?  No.  It was because I placed\r\nthe fullest trust upon love.  I was vain enough to think that I\r\nhad the power in me to bear the sight of truth in its awful\r\nnakedness.  It was tempting Providence, but still I clung to my\r\nproud determination to come out victorious in the trial.\r\n\r\nBimala had failed to understand me in one thing.  She could not\r\nfully realize that I held as weakness all imposition of force.\r\nOnly the weak dare not be just.  They shirk their responsibility\r\nof fairness and try quickly to get at results through the short-\r\ncuts of injustice.  Bimala has no patience with patience.  She\r\nloves to find in men the turbulent, the angry, the unjust.  Her\r\nrespect must have its element of fear.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that when Bimala found herself free in the outer\r\nworld she would be rescued from her infatuation for tyranny.  But\r\nnow I feel sure that this infatuation is deep down in her nature.\r\nHer love is for the boisterous.  From the tip of her tongue to\r\nthe pit of her stomach she must tingle with red pepper in order\r\nto enjoy the simple fare of life.  But my determination was,\r\nnever to do my duty with frantic impetuosity, helped on by the\r\nfiery liquor of excitement.  I know Bimala finds it difficult to\r\nrespect me for this, taking my scruples for feebleness--and she\r\nis quite angry with me because I am not running amuck crying\r\n__Bande Mataram__.\r\n\r\nFor the matter of that, I have become unpopular with all my\r\ncountrymen because I have not joined them in their carousals.\r\nThey are certain that either I have a longing for some title, or\r\nelse that I am afraid of the police.  The police on their side\r\nsuspect me of harbouring some hidden design and protesting too\r\nmuch in my mildness.\r\n\r\nWhat I really feel is this, that those who cannot find food for\r\ntheir enthusiasm in a knowledge of their country as it actually\r\nis, or those who cannot love men just because they are men--who\r\nneeds must shout and deify their country in order to keep up\r\ntheir excitement--these love excitement more than their country.\r\n\r\nTo try to give our infatuation a higher place than Truth is a\r\nsign of inherent slavishness.  Where our minds are free we find\r\nourselves lost.  Our moribund vitality must have for its rider\r\neither some fantasy, or someone in authority, or a sanction from\r\nthe pundits, in order to make it move.  So long as we are\r\nimpervious to truth and have to be moved by some hypnotic\r\nstimulus, we must know that we lack the capacity for self-\r\ngovernment.  Whatever may be our condition, we shall either need\r\nsome imaginary ghost or some actual medicine-man to terrorize\r\nover us.\r\n\r\nThe other day when Sandip accused me of lack of imagination,\r\nsaying that this prevented me from realizing my country in a\r\nvisible image, Bimala agreed with him.  I did not say anything in\r\nmy defence, because to win in argument does not lead to\r\nhappiness.  Her difference of opinion is not due to any\r\ninequality of intelligence, but rather to dissimilarity of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThey accuse me of being unimaginative--that is, according to\r\nthem, I may have oil in my lamp, but no flame.  Now this is\r\nexactly the accusation which I bring against them.  I would say\r\nto them: \"You are dark, even as the flints are.  You must come to\r\nviolent conflicts and make a noise in order to produce your\r\nsparks.  But their disconnected flashes merely assist your pride,\r\nand not your clear vision.\"\r\n\r\nI have been noticing for some time that there is a gross cupidity\r\nabout Sandip.  His fleshly feelings make him harbour delusions\r\nabout his religion and impel him into a tyrannical attitude in\r\nhis patriotism.  His intellect is keen, but his nature is coarse,\r\nand so he glorifies his selfish lusts under high-sounding names.\r\nThe cheap consolations of hatred are as urgently necessary for\r\nhim as the satisfaction of his appetites.  Bimala has often\r\nwarned me, in the old days, of his hankering after money.  I\r\nunderstood this, but I could not bring myself to haggle with\r\nSandip.  I felt ashamed even to own to myself that he was trying\r\nto take advantage of me.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be difficult to explain to Bimala today that\r\nSandip's love of country is but a different phase of his covetous\r\nself-love.  Bimala's hero-worship of Sandip makes me hesitate all\r\nthe more to talk to her about him, lest some touch of jealousy\r\nmay lead me unwittingly into exaggeration.  It may be that the\r\npain at my heart is already making me see a distorted picture of\r\nSandip.  And yet it is better perhaps to speak out than to keep\r\nmy feelings gnawing within me.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have known my master these thirty years.  Neither calumny, nor\r\ndisaster, nor death itself has any terrors for him.  Nothing\r\ncould have saved me, born as I was into the traditions of this\r\nfamily of ours, but that he has established his own life in the\r\ncentre of mine, with its peace and truth and spiritual vision,\r\nthus making it possible for me to realize goodness in its truth.\r\n\r\nMy master came to me that day and said: \"Is it necessary to\r\ndetain Sandip here any longer?\"\r\n\r\nHis nature was so sensitive to all omens of evil that he had at\r\nonce understood.  He was not easily moved, but that day he felt\r\nthe dark shadow of trouble ahead.  Do I not know how well he\r\nloves me?\r\n\r\nAt tea-time I said to Sandip: \"I have just had a letter from\r\nRangpur.  They are complaining that I am selfishly detaining you.\r\nWhen will you be going there?\"\r\n\r\nBimala was pouring out the tea.  Her face fell at once.  She\r\nthrew just one enquiring glance at Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking,\" said Sandip, \"that this wandering up and\r\ndown means a tremendous waste of energy.  I feel that if I could\r\nwork from a centre I could achieve more permanent results.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he looked up at Bimala and asked: \"Do you not think so\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\nBimala hesitated for a reply and then said: \"Both ways seem good\r\n--to do the work from a centre, as well as by travelling about.\r\nThat in which you find greater satisfaction is the way for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me speak out my mind,\" said Sandip.  \"I have never yet\r\nfound any one source of inspiration suffice me for good.  That is\r\nwhy I have been constantly moving about, rousing enthusiasm in\r\nthe people, from which in turn I draw my own store of energy.\r\nToday you have given me the message of my country.  Such fire I\r\nhave never beheld in any man.  I shall be able to spread the fire\r\nof enthusiasm in my country by borrowing it from you.  No, do not\r\nbe ashamed.  You are far above all modesty and diffidence.  You\r\nare the Queen Bee of our hive, and we the workers shall rally\r\naround you.  You shall be our centre, our inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nBimala flushed all over with bashful pride and her hand shook as\r\nshe went on pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\nAnother day my master came to me and said: \"Why don't you two go\r\nup to Darjeeling for a change?  You are not looking well.  Have\r\nyou been getting enough sleep?\"\r\n\r\nI asked Bimala in the evening whether she would care to have a\r\ntrip to the Hills.  I knew she had a great longing to see the\r\nHimalayas.  But she refused ...  The country's Cause, I suppose!\r\n\r\nI must not lose my faith: I shall wait.  The passage from the\r\nnarrow to the larger world is stormy.  When she is familiar with\r\nthis freedom, then I shall know where my place is.  If I discover\r\nthat I do not fit in with the arrangement of the outer world,\r\nthen I shall not quarrel with my fate, but silently take my leave\r\n...  Use force?  But for what?  Can force prevail against Truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandip's Story\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impotent man says: \"That which has come to my share is mine.\"\r\nAnd the weak man assents.  But the lesson of the whole world is:\r\n\"That is really mine which I can snatch away.\"  My country does\r\nnot become mine simply because it is the country of my birth.  It\r\nbecomes mine on the day when I am able to win it by force.\r\n\r\nEvery man has a natural right to possess, and therefore greed is\r\nnatural.  It is not in the wisdom of nature that we should be\r\ncontent to be deprived.  What my mind covets, my surroundings\r\nmust supply.  This is the only true understanding between our\r\ninner and outer nature in this world.  Let moral ideals remain\r\nmerely for those poor anaemic creatures of starved desire whose\r\ngrasp is weak.  Those who can desire with all their soul and\r\nenjoy with all their heart, those who have no hesitation or\r\nscruple, it is they who are the anointed of Providence.  Nature\r\nspreads out her riches and loveliest treasures for their benefit.\r\nThey swim across streams, leap over walls, kick open doors, to\r\nhelp themselves to whatever is worth taking.  In such a getting\r\none can rejoice; such wresting as this gives value to the thing\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nNature surrenders herself, but only to the robber.  For she\r\ndelights in this forceful desire, this forceful abduction.  And\r\nso she does not put the garland of her acceptance round the lean,\r\nscraggy neck of the ascetic.  The music of the wedding march is\r\nstruck.  The time of the wedding I must not let pass.  My heart\r\ntherefore is eager.  For, who is the bridegroom?  It is I.  The\r\nbridegroom's place belongs to him who, torch in hand, can come in\r\ntime.  The bridegroom in Nature's wedding hall comes unexpected\r\nand uninvited.\r\n\r\nAshamed?  No, I am never ashamed!  I ask for whatever I want, and\r\nI do not always wait to ask before I take it.  Those who are\r\ndeprived by their own diffidence dignify their privation by the\r\nname of modesty.  The world into which we are born is the world\r\nof reality.  When a man goes away from the market of real things\r\nwith empty hands and empty stomach, merely filling his bag with\r\nbig sounding words, I wonder why he ever came into this hard\r\nworld at all.  Did these men get their appointment from the\r\nepicures of the religious world, to play set tunes on sweet,\r\npious texts in that pleasure garden where blossom airy nothings?\r\nI neither affect those tunes nor do I find any sustenance in\r\nthose blossoms.\r\n\r\nWhat I desire, I desire positively, superlatively.  I want to\r\nknead it with both my hands and both my feet; I want to smear it\r\nall over my body; I want to gorge myself with it to the full.\r\nThe scrannel pipes of those who have worn themselves out by their\r\nmoral fastings, till they have become flat and pale like starved\r\nvermin infesting a long-deserted bed, will never reach my ear.\r\n\r\nI would conceal nothing, because that would be cowardly.  But if\r\nI cannot bring myself to conceal when concealment is needful,\r\nthat also is cowardly.  Because you have your greed, you build\r\nyour walls.  Because I have my greed, I break through them.  You\r\nuse your power: I use my craft.  These are the realities of life.\r\nOn these depend kingdoms and empires and all the great\r\nenterprises of men.\r\n\r\nAs for those __avatars__ who come down from their paradise to\r\ntalk to us in some holy jargon--their words are not real.\r\nTherefore, in spite of all the applause they get, these sayings\r\nof theirs only find a place in the hiding corners of the weak.\r\n\r\nThey are despised by those who are strong, the rulers of the\r\nworld.  Those who have had the courage to see this have won\r\nsuccess, while those poor wretches who are dragged one way by\r\nnature and the other way by these ava tars, they set one foot in\r\nthe boat of the real and the other in the boat of the unreal, and\r\nthus are in a pitiable plight, able neither to advance nor to\r\nkeep their place.\r\n\r\nThere are many men who seem to have been born only with an\r\nobsession to die.  Possibly there is a beauty, like that of a\r\nsunset, in this lingering death in life which seems to fascinate\r\nthem.  Nikhil lives this kind of life, if life it may be called.\r\nYears ago, I had a great argument with him on this point.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"that you cannot get anything except by\r\nforce.  But then what is this force?  And then also, what is this\r\ngetting?  The strength I believe in is the strength of\r\nrenouncing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you,\" I exclaimed, \"are infatuated with the glory of\r\nbankruptcy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as desperately as the chick is infatuated about the\r\nbankruptcy of its shell,\" he replied.  \"The shell is real enough,\r\nyet it is given up in exchange for intangible light and air.  A\r\nsorry exchange, I suppose you would call it?\"\r\n\r\nWhen once Nikhil gets on to metaphor, there is no hope of making\r\nhim see that he is merely dealing with words, not with realities.\r\nWell, well, let him be happy with his metaphors.  We are the\r\nflesh-eaters of the world; we have teeth and nails; we pursue and\r\ngrab and tear.  We are not satisfied with chewing in the evening\r\nthe cud of the grass we have eaten in the morning.  Anyhow, we\r\ncannot allow your metaphor-mongers to bar the door to our\r\nsustenance.  In that case we shall simply steal or rob, for we\r\nmust live.\r\n\r\nPeople will say that I am starting some novel theory just because\r\nthose who are moving in this world are in the habit of talking\r\ndifferently though they are really acting up to it all the time.\r\nTherefore they fail to understand, as I do, that this is the only\r\nworking moral principle.  In point of fact, I know that my idea\r\nis not an empty theory at all, for it has been proved in\r\npractical life.  I have found that my way always wins over the\r\nhearts of women, who are creatures of this world of reality and\r\ndo not roam about in cloud-land, as men do, in idea-filled\r\nballoons.\r\n\r\nWomen find in my features, my manner, my gait, my speech, a\r\nmasterful passion--not a passion dried thin with the heat of\r\nasceticism, not a passion with its face turned back at every step\r\nin doubt and debate, but a full-blooded passion.  It roars and\r\nrolls on, like a flood, with the cry: \"I want, I want, I want.\"\r\nWomen feel, in their own heart of hearts, that this indomitable\r\npassion is the lifeblood of the world, acknowledging no law but\r\nitself, and therefore victorious.  For this reason they have so\r\noften abandoned themselves to be swept away on the flood-tide of\r\nmy passion, recking naught as to whether it takes them to life or\r\nto death.  This power which wins these women is the power of\r\nmighty men, the power which wins the world of reality.\r\n\r\nThose who imagine the greater desirability of another world\r\nmerely shift their desires from the earth to the skies.  It\r\nremains to be seen how high their gushing fountain will play, and\r\nfor how long.  But this much is certain: women were not created\r\nfor these pale creatures--these lotus-eaters of idealism.\r\n\r\n\"Affinity!\"  When it suited my need, I have often said that God\r\nhas created special pairs of men and women, and that the union of\r\nsuch is the only legitimate union, higher than all unions made by\r\nlaw.  The reason of it is, that though man wants to follow\r\nnature, he can find no pleasure in it unless he screens himself\r\nwith some phrase--and that is why this world is so overflowing\r\nwith lies.\r\n\r\n\"Affinity!\"  Why should there be only one?  There may be affinity\r\nwith thousands.  It was never in my agreement with nature that I\r\nshould overlook all my innumerable affinities for the sake of\r\nonly one.  I have discovered many in my own life up to now, yet\r\nthat has not closed the door to one more--and that one is clearly\r\nvisible to my eyes.  She has also discovered her own affinity to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAnd then?\r\n\r\nThen, if I do not win I am a coward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Three\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI WONDER what could have happened to my feeling of shame.  The\r\nfact is, I had no time to think about myself.  My days and nights\r\nwere passing in a whirl, like an eddy with myself in the centre.\r\nNo gap was left for hesitation or delicacy to enter.\r\n\r\nOne day my sister-in-law remarked to my husband: \"Up to now the\r\nwomen of this house have been kept weeping.  Here comes the men's\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\"We must see that they do not miss it,\" she continued, turning to\r\nme.  \"I see you are out for the fray, Chota [12] Rani!  Hurl your\r\nshafts straight at their hearts.\"\r\n\r\nHer keen eyes looked me up and down.  Not one of the colours into\r\nwhich my toilet, my dress, my manners, my speech, had blossomed\r\nout had escaped her.  I am ashamed to speak of it today, but I\r\nfelt no shame then.  Something within me was at work of which I\r\nwas not even conscious.  I used to overdress, it is true, but\r\nmore like an automaton, with no particular design.  No doubt I\r\nknew which effort of mine would prove specially pleasing to\r\nSandip Babu, but that required no intuition, for he would discuss\r\nit openly before all of them.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to my husband: \"Do you know, Nikhil, when I first\r\nsaw our Queen Bee, she was sitting there so demurely in her gold-\r\nbordered __sari__.  Her eyes were gazing inquiringly into\r\nspace, like stars which had lost their way, just as if she had\r\nbeen for ages standing on the edge of some darkness, looking out\r\nfor something unknown.  But when I saw her, I felt a quiver run\r\nthrough me.  It seemed to me that the gold border of her\r\n__sari__ was her own inner fire flaming out and twining round\r\nher.  That is the flame we want, visible fire!  Look here, Queen\r\nBee, you really must do us the favour of dressing once more as a\r\nliving flame.\"\r\n\r\nSo long I had been like a small river at the border of a village.\r\nMy rhythm and my language were different from what they are now.\r\nBut the tide came up from the sea, and my breast heaved; my banks\r\ngave way and the great drumbeats of the sea waves echoed in my\r\nmad current.  I could not understand the meaning of that sound in\r\nmy blood.  Where was that former self of mine?  Whence came\r\nfoaming into me this surging flood of glory?  Sandip's hungry\r\neyes burnt like the lamps of worship before my shrine.  All his\r\ngaze proclaimed that I was a wonder in beauty and power; and the\r\nloudness of his praise, spoken and unspoken, drowned all other\r\nvoices in my world.  Had the Creator created me afresh, I\r\nwondered?  Did he wish to make up now for neglecting me so long?\r\nI who before was plain had become suddenly beautiful.  I who\r\nbefore had been of no account now felt in myself all the\r\nsplendour of Bengal itself.\r\n\r\nFor Sandip Babu was not a mere individual.  In him was the\r\nconfluence of millions of minds of the country.  When he called\r\nme the Queen Bee of the hive, I was acclaimed with a chorus of\r\npraise by all our patriot workers.  After that, the loud jests of\r\nmy sister-in-law could not touch me any longer.  My relations\r\nwith all the world underwent a change.  Sandip Babu made it clear\r\nhow all the country was in need of me.  I had no difficulty in\r\nbelieving this at the time, for I felt that I had the power to do\r\neverything.  Divine strength had come to me.  It was something\r\nwhich I had never felt before, which was beyond myself.  I had no\r\ntime to question it to find out what was its nature.  It seemed\r\nto belong to me, and yet to transcend me.  It comprehended the\r\nwhole of Bengal.\r\n\r\nSandip Babu would consult me about every little thing touching\r\nthe Cause.  At first I felt very awkward and would hang back, but\r\nthat soon wore off.  Whatever I suggested seemed to astonish him.\r\nHe would go into raptures and say: \"Men can only think.  You\r\nwomen have a way of understanding without thinking.  Woman was\r\ncreated out of God's own fancy.  Man, He had to hammer into\r\nshape.\"\r\n\r\nLetters used to come to Sandip Babu from all parts of the country\r\nwhich were submitted to me for my opinion.  Occasionally he\r\ndisagreed with me.  But I would not argue with him.  Then after a\r\nday or two--as if a new light had suddenly dawned upon him--he\r\nwould send for me and say: \"It was my mistake.  Your suggestion\r\nwas the correct one.\"  He would often confess to me that wherever\r\nhe had taken steps contrary to my advice he had gone wrong.  Thus\r\nI gradually came to be convinced that behind whatever was taking\r\nplace was Sandip Babu, and behind Sandip Babu was the plain\r\ncommon sense of a woman.  The glory of a great responsibility\r\nfilled my being.\r\n\r\nMy husband had no place in our counsels.  Sandip Babu treated him\r\nas a younger brother, of whom personally one may be very fond and\r\nyet have no use for his business advice.  He would tenderly and\r\nsmilingly talk about my husband's childlike innocence, saying\r\nthat his curious doctrine and perversities of mind had a flavour\r\nof humour which made them all the more lovable.  It was seemingly\r\nthis very affection for Nikhil which led Sandip Babu to forbear\r\nfrom troubling him with the burden of the country.\r\n\r\nNature has many anodynes in her pharmacy, which she secretly\r\nadministers when vital relations are being insidiously severed,\r\nso that none may know of the operation, till at last one awakes\r\nto know what a great rent has been made.  When the knife was busy\r\nwith my life's most intimate tie, my mind was so clouded with\r\nfumes of intoxicating gas that I was not in the least aware of\r\nwhat a cruel thing was happening.  Possibly this is woman's\r\nnature.  When her passion is roused she loses her sensibility for\r\nall that is outside it.  When, like the river, we women keep to\r\nour banks, we give nourishment with all that we have: when we\r\noverflow them we destroy with all that we are.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n12. Bimala.  the younger brother's wife, was the __Chota__ or\r\nJunior Rani.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandip's Story\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can see that something has gone wrong.  I got an inkling of it\r\nthe other day.\r\n\r\nEver since my arrival, Nikhil's sitting-room had become a thing\r\namphibious--half women's apartment, half men's: Bimala had access\r\nto it from the zenana, it was not barred to me from the outer\r\nside.  If we had only gone slow, and made use of our privileges\r\nwith some restraint, we might not have fallen foul of other\r\npeople.  But we went ahead so vehemently that we could not think\r\nof the consequences.\r\n\r\nWhenever Bee comes into Nikhil's room, I somehow get to know of\r\nit from mine.  There are the tinkle of bangles and other little\r\nsounds; the door is perhaps shut with a shade of unnecessary\r\nvehemence; the bookcase is a trifle stiff and creaks if jerked\r\nopen.  When I enter I find Bee, with her back to the door, ever\r\nso busy selecting a book from the shelves.  And as I offer to\r\nassist her in this difficult task she starts and protests; and\r\nthen we naturally get on to other topics.\r\n\r\nThe other day, on an inauspicious [13] Thursday afternoon, I\r\nsallied forth from my room at the call of these same sounds.\r\nThere was a man on guard in the passage.  I walked on without so\r\nmuch as glancing at him, but as I approached the door he put\r\nhimself in my way saying: \"Not that way, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that way!  Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Rani Mother is there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well.  Tell your Rani Mother that Sandip Babu wants to\r\nsee her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be, sir.  It is against orders.\"\r\n\r\nI felt highly indignant.  \"I order you!\"  I said in a raised\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Go and announce me.\"\r\n\r\nThe fellow was somewhat taken aback at my attitude.  In the\r\nmeantime I had neared the door.  I was on the point of reaching\r\nit, when he followed after me and took me by the arm saying: \"No,\r\nsir, you must not.\"\r\n\r\nWhat!  To be touched by a flunkey!  I snatched away my arm and\r\ngave the man a sounding blow.  At this moment Bee came out of the\r\nroom to find the man about to insult me.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the picture of her wrath!  That Bee is\r\nbeautiful is a discovery of my own.  Most of our people would see\r\nnothing in her.  Her tall, slim figure these boors would call\r\n\"lanky\".  But it is just this lithesomeness of hers that I\r\nadmire--like an up-leaping fountain of life, coming direct out of\r\nthe depths of the Creator's heart.  Her complexion is dark, but\r\nit is the lustrous darkness of a sword-blade, keen and\r\nscintillating.\r\n\r\n\"Nanku!\"  she commanded, as she stood in the doorway, pointing\r\nwith her finger, \"leave us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be angry with him,\" said I.  \"If it is against orders, it\r\nis I who should retire.\"\r\n\r\nBee's voice was still trembling as she replied: \"You must not go.\r\nCome in.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a request, but again a command!  I followed her in,\r\nand taking a chair fanned myself with a fan which was on the\r\ntable.  Bee scribbled something with a pencil on a sheet of paper\r\nand, summoning a servant, handed it to him saying: \"Take this to\r\nthe Maharaja.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me,\" I resumed.  \"I was unable to control myself, and\r\nhit that man of yours.\r\n\r\n\"You served him right,\" said Bee.\r\n\r\n\"But it was not the poor fellow's fault, after all.  He was only\r\nobeying his orders.\"\r\n\r\nHere Nikhil came in, and as he did so I left my seat with a rapid\r\nmovement and went and stood near the window with my back to the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Nanku, the guard, has insulted Sandip Babu,\" said Bee to Nikhil.\r\n\r\nNikhil seemed to be so genuinely surprised that I had to turn\r\nround and stare at him.  Even an outrageously good man fails in\r\nkeeping up his pride of truthfulness before his wife--if she be\r\nthe proper kind of woman.\r\n\r\n\"He insolently stood in the way when Sandip Babu was coming in\r\nhere,\" continued Bee.  \"He said he had orders ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose orders?\"  asked Nikhil.\r\n\r\n\"How am I to know?\"  exclaimed Bee impatiently, her eyes brimming\r\nover with mortification.\r\n\r\nNikhil sent for the man and questioned him.  \"It was not my\r\nfault,\" Nanku repeated sullenly.  \"I had my orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who gave you the order?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bara Rani Mother.\"\r\n\r\nWe were all silent for a while.  After the man had left, Bee\r\nsaid: \"Nanku must go!\"\r\n\r\nNikhil remained silent.  I could see that his sense of justice\r\nwould not allow this.  There was no end to his qualms.  But this\r\ntime he was up against a tough problem.  Bee was not the woman to\r\ntake things lying down.  She would have to get even with her\r\nsister-in-law by punishing this fellow.  And as Nikhil remained\r\nsilent, her eyes flashed fire.  She knew not how to pour her\r\nscorn upon her husband's feebleness of spirit.  Nikhil left the\r\nroom after a while without another word.\r\n\r\nThe next day Nanku was not to be seen.  On inquiry, I learnt that\r\nhe had been sent off to some other part of the estates, and that\r\nhis wages had not suffered by such transfer.\r\n\r\nI could catch glimpses of the ravages of the storm raging over\r\nthis, behind the scenes.  All I can say is, that Nikhil is a\r\ncurious creature, quite out of the common.\r\n\r\nThe upshot was, that after this Bee began to send for me to the\r\nsitting-room, for a chat, without any contrivance, or pretence of\r\nits being an accident.  Thus from bare suggestion we came to\r\nbroad hint: the implied came to be expressed.  The daughter-in-\r\nlaw of a princely house lives in a starry region so remote from\r\nthe ordinary outsider that there is not even a regular road for\r\nhis approach.  What a triumphal progress of Truth was this which,\r\ngradually but persistently, thrust aside veil after veil of\r\nobscuring custom, till at length Nature herself was laid bare.\r\n\r\nTruth?  Of course it was the truth!  The attraction of man and\r\nwoman for each other is fundamental.  The whole world of matter,\r\nfrom the speck of dust upwards, is ranged on its side.  And yet\r\nmen would keep it hidden away out of sight, behind a tissue of\r\nwords; and with home-made sanctions and prohibitions make of it a\r\ndomestic utensil.  Why, it's as absurd as melting down the solar\r\nsystem to make a watch-chain for one's son-in-law!  [14]\r\n\r\nWhen, in spite of all, reality awakes at the call of what is but\r\nnaked truth, what a gnashing of teeth and beating of breasts is\r\nthere!  But can one carry on a quarrel with a storm?  It never\r\ntakes the trouble to reply, it only gives a shaking.\r\n\r\nI am enjoying the sight of this truth, as it gradually reveals\r\nitself.  These tremblings of steps, these turnings of the face,\r\nare sweet to me: and sweet are the deceptions which deceive not\r\nonly others, but also Bee herself.  When Reality has to meet the\r\nunreal, deception is its principal weapon; for its enemies always\r\ntry to shame Reality by calling it gross, and so it needs must\r\nhide itself, or else put on some disguise.  The circumstances are\r\nsuch that it dare not frankly avow: \"Yes, I am gross, because I\r\nam true.  I am flesh.  I am passion.  I am hunger, unashamed and\r\ncruel.\"\r\n\r\nAll is now clear to me.  The curtain flaps, and through it I can\r\nsee the preparations for the catastrophe.  The little red ribbon,\r\nwhich peeps through the luxuriant masses of her hair, with its\r\nflush of secret longing, it is the lolling tongue of the red\r\nstorm cloud.  I feel the warmth of each turn of her __sari__,\r\neach suggestion of her raiment, of which even the wearer may not\r\nbe fully conscious.\r\n\r\nBee was not conscious, because she was ashamed of the reality; to\r\nwhich men have given a bad name, calling it Satan; and so it has\r\nto steal into the garden of paradise in the guise of a snake, and\r\nwhisper secrets into the ears of man's chosen consort and make\r\nher rebellious; then farewell to all ease; and after that comes\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\nMy poor little Queen Bee is living in a dream.  She knows not\r\nwhich way she is treading.  It would not be safe to awaken her\r\nbefore the time.  It is best for me to pretend to be equally\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nThe other day, at dinner, she was gazing at me in a curious sort\r\nof way, little realizing what such glances mean!  As my eyes met\r\nhers, she turned away with a flush.  \"You are surprised at my\r\nappetite,\" I remarked.  \"I can hide everything, except that I am\r\ngreedy!  Anyhow, why trouble to blush for me, since I am\r\nshameless?\"\r\n\r\nThis only made her colour more furiously, as she stammered: \"No,\r\nno, I was only...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I interrupted.  \"Women have a weakness for greedy men;\r\nfor it is this greed of ours which gives them the upper hand.\r\nThe indulgence which I have always received at their hands has\r\nmade me all the more shameless.  I do not mind your watching the\r\ngood things disappear, not one bit.  I mean to enjoy every one of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe other day I was reading an English book in which sex-problems\r\nwere treated in an audaciously realistic manner.  I had left it\r\nlying in the sitting-room.  As I went there the next afternoon,\r\nfor something or other, I found Bee seated with this book in her\r\nhand.  When she heard my footsteps she hurriedly put it down and\r\nplaced another book over it--a volume of Mrs Hemans's poems.\r\n\r\n\"I have never been able to make out,\" I began, \"why women are so\r\nshy about being caught reading poetry.  We men--lawyers,\r\nmechanics, or what not--may well feel ashamed.  If we must read\r\npoetry, it should be at dead of night, within closed doors.  But\r\nyou women are so akin to poesy.  The Creator Himself is a lyric\r\npoet, and Jayadeva [15] must have practised the divine art seated\r\nat His feet.\"\r\n\r\nBee made no reply, but only blushed uncomfortably.  She made as\r\nif she would leave the room.  Whereupon I protested: \"No, no,\r\npray read on.  I will just take a book I left here, and run\r\naway.\"  With which I took up my book from the table.  \"Lucky you\r\ndid not think of glancing over its pages,\" I continued, \"or you\r\nwould have wanted to chastise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!  Why?\"  asked Bee.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is not poetry,\" said I.  \"Only blunt things, bluntly\r\nput, without any finicking niceness.  I wish Nikhil would read\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBee frowned a little as she murmured: \"What makes you wish that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a man, you see, one of us.  My only quarrel with him is\r\nthat he delights in a misty vision of this world.  Have you not\r\nobserved how this trait of his makes him look on __Swadeshi__\r\nas if it was some poem of which the metre must be kept correct at\r\nevery step?  We, with the clubs of our prose, are the iconoclasts\r\nof metre.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has your book to do with __Swadeshi__?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would know if you only read it.  Nikhil wants to go by made-\r\nup maxims, in __Swadeshi__ as in everything else; so he knocks\r\nup against human nature at every turn, and then falls to abusing\r\nit.  He never will realize that human nature was created long\r\nbefore phrases were, and will survive them too.\"\r\n\r\nBee was silent for a while and then gravely said: \"Is it not a\r\npart of human nature to try and rise superior to itself?\"\r\n\r\nI smiled inwardly.  \"These are not your words\", I thought to\r\nmyself.  \"You have learnt them from Nikhil.  You are a healthy\r\nhuman being.  Your flesh and blood have responded to the call of\r\nreality.  You are burning in every vein with life-fire--do I not\r\nknow it?  How long should they keep you cool with the wet towel\r\nof moral precepts?\"\r\n\r\n\"The weak are in the majority,\" I said aloud.  \"They are\r\ncontinually poisoning the ears of men by repeating these\r\nshibboleths.  Nature has denied them strength--it is thus that\r\nthey try to enfeeble others.\"\r\n\r\n\"We women are weak,\" replied Bimala.  \"So I suppose we must join\r\nin the conspiracy of the weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women weak!\"  I exclaimed with a laugh.  \"Men belaud you as\r\ndelicate and fragile, so as to delude you into thinking\r\nyourselves weak.  But it is you women who are strong.  Men make a\r\ngreat outward show of their so-called freedom, but those who know\r\ntheir inner minds are aware of their bondage.  They have\r\nmanufactured scriptures with their own hands to bind themselves;\r\nwith their very idealism they have made golden fetters of women\r\nto wind round their body and mind.  If men had not that\r\nextraordinary faculty of entangling themselves in meshes of their\r\nown contriving, nothing could have kept them bound.  But as for\r\nyou women, you have desired to conceive reality with body and\r\nsoul.  You have given birth to reality.  You have suckled reality\r\nat your breasts.\"\r\n\r\nBee was well read for a woman, and would not easily give in to my\r\narguments.  \"If that were true,\" she objected, \"men would not\r\nhave found women attractive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women realize the danger,\" I replied.  \"They know that men love\r\ndelusions, so they give them full measure by borrowing their own\r\nphrases.  They know that man, the drunkard, values intoxication\r\nmore than food, and so they try to pass themselves off as an\r\nintoxicant.  As a matter of fact, but for the sake of man, woman\r\nhas no need for any make-believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, are you troubling to destroy the illusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"For freedom.  I want the country to be free.  I want human\r\nrelations to be free.\"\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n13. According to the Hindu calendar [Trans.].\r\n\r\n14. The son-in-law is the pet of a Hindu household.\r\n\r\n15. A Vaishnava poet (Sanskrit) whose lyrics of the adoration of\r\nthe Divinity serve as well to express all shades of human passion\r\n[Trans.].\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was aware that it is unsafe suddenly to awake a sleep-walker.\r\nBut I am so impetuous by nature, a halting gait does not suit me.\r\nI knew I was overbold that day.  I knew that the first shock of\r\nsuch ideas is apt to be almost intolerable.  But with women it is\r\nalways audacity that wins.\r\n\r\nJust as we were getting on nicely, who should walk in but\r\nNikhil's old tutor Chandranath Babu.  The world would have been\r\nnot half a bad place to live in but for these schoolmasters, who\r\nmake one want to quit in disgust.  The Nikhil type wants to keep\r\nthe world always a school.  This incarnation of a school turned\r\nup that afternoon at the psychological moment.\r\n\r\nWe all remain schoolboys in some corner of our hearts, and I,\r\neven I, felt somewhat pulled up.  As for poor Bee, she at once\r\ntook her place solemnly, like the topmost girl of the class on\r\nthe front bench.  All of a sudden she seemed to remember that she\r\nhad to face her examination.\r\n\r\nSome people are so like eternal pointsmen lying in wait by the\r\nline, to shunt one's train of thought from one rail to another.\r\n\r\nChandranath Babu had no sooner come in than he cast about for\r\nsome excuse to retire, mumbling: \"I beg your pardon, I...\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could finish, Bee went up to him and made a profound\r\nobeisance, saying: \"Pray do not leave us, sir.  Will you not take\r\na seat?\"  She looked like a drowning person clutching at him for\r\nsupport--the little coward!\r\n\r\nBut possibly I was mistaken.  It is quite likely that there was a\r\ntouch of womanly wile in it.  She wanted, perhaps, to raise her\r\nvalue in my eyes.  She might have been pointedly saying to me:\r\n\"Please don't imagine for a moment that I am entirely overcome by\r\nyou.  My respect for Chandranath Babu is even greater.\"\r\n\r\nWell, indulge in your respect by all means!  Schoolmasters thrive\r\non it.  But not being one of them, I have no use for that empty\r\ncompliment.\r\n\r\nChandranath Babu began to talk about __Swadeshi__.  I thought\r\nI would let him go on with his monologues.  There is nothing like\r\nletting an old man talk himself out.  It makes him feel that he\r\nis winding up the world, forgetting all the while how far away\r\nthe real world is from his wagging tongue.\r\n\r\nBut even my worst enemy would not accuse me of patience.  And\r\nwhen Chandranath Babu went on to say: \"If we expect to gather\r\nfruit where we have sown no seed, then we ...\"  I had to\r\ninterrupt him.\r\n\r\n\"Who wants fruit?\"  I cried.  \"We go by the Author of the Gita\r\nwho says that we are concerned only with the doing, not with the\r\nfruit of our deeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then that you do want?\"  asked Chandranath Babu.\r\n\r\n\"Thorns!\"  I exclaimed, \"which cost nothing to plant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thorns do not obstruct others only,\" he replied.  \"They have a\r\nway of hurting one's own feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all right for a copy-book,\" I retorted.  \"But the real\r\nthing is that we have this burning at heart.  Now we have only to\r\ncultivate thorns for other's soles; afterwards when they hurt us\r\nwe shall find leisure to repent.  But why be frightened even of\r\nthat?  When at last we have to die it will be time enough to get\r\ncold.  While we are on fire let us seethe and boil.\"\r\n\r\nChandranath Babu smiled.  \"Seethe by all means,\" he said, \"but do\r\nnot mistake it for work, or heroism.  Nations which have got on\r\nin the world have done so by action, not by ebullition.  Those\r\nwho have always lain in dread of work, when with a start they\r\nawake to their sorry plight, they look to short-cuts and scamping\r\nfor their deliverance.\"\r\n\r\nI was girding up my loins to deliver a crushing reply, when\r\nNikhil came back.  Chandranath Babu rose, and looking towards\r\nBee, said: \"Let me go now, my little mother, I have some work to\r\nattend to.\"\r\n\r\nAs he left, I showed Nikhil the book in my hand.  \"I was telling\r\nQueen Bee about this book,\" I said.\r\n\r\nNinety-nine per cent of people have to be deluded with lies, but\r\nit is easier to delude this perpetual pupil of the schoolmaster\r\nwith the truth.  He is best cheated openly.  So, in playing with\r\nhim, the simplest course was to lay my cards on the table.\r\n\r\nNikhil read the title on the cover, but said nothing.  \"These\r\nwriters,\" I continued, \"are busy with their brooms, sweeping away\r\nthe dust of epithets with which men have covered up this world of\r\nours.  So, as I was saying, I wish you would read it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have read it,\" said Nikhil.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well for those who really care to think, but\r\npoison for those who shirk thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who preach 'Equal Rights of Property' should not be\r\nthieves.  For, if they are, they would be preaching lies.  When\r\npassion is in the ascendant, this kind of book is not rightly\r\nunderstood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Passion,\" I replied, \"is the street lamp which guides us.  To\r\ncall it untrue is as hopeless as to expect to see better by\r\nplucking out our natural eyes.\"\r\n\r\nNikhil was visibly growing excited.  \"I accept the truth of\r\npassion,\" he said, \"only when I recognize the truth of restraint.\r\nBy pressing what we want to see right into our eyes we only\r\ninjure them: we do not see.  So does the violence of passion,\r\nwhich would leave no space between the mind and its object,\r\ndefeat its purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is simply your intellectual foppery,\" I replied, \"which makes\r\nyou indulge in moral delicacy, ignoring the savage side of truth.\r\nThis merely helps you to mystify things, and so you fail to do\r\nyour work with any degree of strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"The intrusion of strength,\" said Nikhil impatiently, \"where\r\nstrength is out of place, does not help you in your work ...  But\r\nwhy are we arguing about these things?  Vain arguments only brush\r\noff the fresh bloom of truth.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted Bee to join in the discussion, but she had not said a\r\nword up to now.  Could I have given her too rude a shock, leaving\r\nher assailed with doubts and wanting to learn her lesson afresh\r\nfrom the schoolmaster?  Still, a thorough shaking-up is\r\nessential.  One must begin by realizing that things supposed to\r\nbe unshakeable can be shaken.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad I had this talk with you,\" I said to Nikhil, \"for I\r\nwas on the point of lending this book to Queen Bee to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"What harm?\"  said Nikhil.  \"If I could read the book, why not\r\nBimala too?  All I want to say is, that in Europe people look at\r\neverything from the viewpoint of science.  But man is neither\r\nmere physiology, nor biology, nor psychology, nor even sociology.\r\nFor God's sake don't forget that.  Man is infinitely more than\r\nthe natural science of himself.  You laugh at me, calling me the\r\nschoolmaster's pupil, but that is what you are, not I.  You want\r\nto find the truth of man from your science teachers, and not from\r\nyour own inner being.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why all this excitement?\"  I mocked.\r\n\r\n\"Because I see you are bent on insulting man and making him\r\npetty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth do you see all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the air, in my outraged feelings.  You would go on wounding\r\nthe great, the unselfish, the beautiful in man.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mad idea is this of yours?\"\r\n\r\nNikhil suddenly stood up.  \"I tell you plainly, Sandip,\" he said,\r\n\"man may be wounded unto death, but he will not die.  This is the\r\nreason why I am ready to suffer all, knowing all, with eyes\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he hurriedly left the room.\r\n\r\nI was staring blankly at his retreating figure, when the sound of\r\na book, falling from the table, made me turn to find Bee\r\nfollowing him with quick, nervous steps, making a detour to avoid\r\npassing too near me.\r\n\r\nA curious creature, that Nikhil!  He feels the danger threatening\r\nhis home, and yet why does he not turn me out?  I know, he is\r\nwaiting for Bimal to give him the cue.  If Bimal tells him that\r\ntheir mating has been a misfit, he will bow his head and admit\r\nthat it may have been a blunder!  He has not the strength of mind\r\nto understand that to acknowledge a mistake is the greatest of\r\nall mistakes.  He is a typical example of how ideas make for\r\nweakness.  I have not seen another like him--so whimsical a\r\nproduct of nature!  He would hardly do as a character in a novel\r\nor drama, to say nothing of real life.\r\n\r\nAnd Bee?  I am afraid her dream-life is over from today.  She has\r\nat length understood the nature of the current which is bearing\r\nher along.  Now she must either advance or retreat, open-eyed.\r\nThe chances are she will now advance a step, and then retreat a\r\nstep.  But that does not disturb me.  When one is on fire, this\r\nrushing to and fro makes the blaze all the fiercer.  The fright\r\nshe has got will only fan her passion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I had better not say much to her, but simply select some\r\nmodern books for her to read.  Let her gradually come to the\r\nconviction that to acknowledge and respect passion as the supreme\r\nreality, is to be modern--not to be ashamed of it, not to glorify\r\nrestraint.  If she finds shelter in some such word as \"modern\",\r\nshe will find strength.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, I must see this out to the end of the Fifth\r\nAct.  I cannot, unfortunately, boast of being merely a spectator,\r\nseated in the royal box, applauding now and again.  There is a\r\nwrench at my heart, a pang in every nerve.  When I have put out\r\nthe light and am in my bed, little touches, little glances,\r\nlittle words flit about and fill the darkness.  When I get up in\r\nthe morning, I thrill with lively anticipations, my blood seems\r\nto course through me to the strains of music ...\r\n\r\nThere was a double photo-frame on the table with Bee's photograph\r\nby the side of Nikhil's.  I had taken out hers.  Yesterday I\r\nshowed Bee the empty side and said: \"Theft becomes necessary only\r\nbecause of miserliness, so its sin must be divided between the\r\nmiser and the thief.  Do you not think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not a good one,\" observed Bee simply, with a little\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\"  said I.  \"A portrait cannot be better than\r\na portrait.  I must be content with it, such as it is.\"\r\n\r\nBee took up a book and began to turn over the pages.  \"If you are\r\nannoyed,\" I went on, \"I must make a shift to fill up the\r\nvacancy.\"\r\n\r\nToday I have filled it up.  This photograph of mine was taken in\r\nmy early youth.  My face was then fresher, and so was my mind.\r\nThen I still cherished some illusions about this world and the\r\nnext.  Faith deceives men, but it has one great merit: it imparts\r\na radiance to the features.\r\n\r\nMy portrait now reposes next to Nikhil's, for are not the two of\r\nus old friends?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Four\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI WAS never self-conscious.  But nowadays I often try to take an\r\noutside view--to see myself as Bimal sees me.  What a dismally\r\nsolemn picture it makes, my habit of taking things too seriously!\r\n\r\nBetter, surely, to laugh away the world than flood it with tears.\r\nThat is, in fact, how the world gets on.  We relish our food and\r\nrest, only because we can dismiss, as so many empty shadows, the\r\nsorrows scattered everywhere, both in the home and in the outer\r\nworld.  If we took them as true, even for a moment, where would\r\nbe our appetite, our sleep?\r\n\r\nBut I cannot dismiss myself as one of these shadows, and so the\r\nload of my sorrow lies eternally heavy on the heart of my world.\r\n\r\nWhy not stand out aloof in the highway of the universe, and feel\r\nyourself to be part of the all?  In the midst of the immense,\r\nage-long concourse of humanity, what is Bimal to you?  Your wife?\r\nWhat is a wife?  A bubble of a name blown big with your own\r\nbreath, so carefully guarded night and day, yet ready to burst at\r\nany pin-prick from outside.\r\n\r\nMy wife--and so, forsooth, my very own!  If she says: \"No, I am\r\nmyself\"--am I to reply: \"How can that be?  Are you not mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife\"--Does that amount to an argument, much less the truth?\r\nCan one imprison a whole personality within that name?\r\n\r\nMy wife!--Have I not cherished in this little world all that is\r\npurest and sweetest in my life, never for a moment letting it\r\ndown from my bosom to the dust?  What incense of worship, what\r\nmusic of passion, what flowers of my spring and of my autumn,\r\nhave I not offered up at its shrine?  If, like a toy paper-boat,\r\nshe be swept along into the muddy waters of the gutter--would I\r\nnot also...  ?\r\n\r\nThere it is again, my incorrigible solemnity!  Why \"muddy\"?  What\r\n\"gutter\" names, called in a fit of jealousy, do not change the\r\nfacts of the world.  If Bimal is not mine, she is not; and no\r\nfuming, or fretting, or arguing will serve to prove that she is.\r\nIf my heart is breaking--let it break!  That will not make the\r\nworld bankrupt--nor even me; for man is so much greater than the\r\nthings he loses in this life.  The very ocean of tears has its\r\nother shore, else none would have ever wept.\r\n\r\nBut then there is Society to be considered ...  which let Society\r\nconsider!  If I weep it is for myself, not for Society.  If Bimal\r\nshould say she is not mine, what care I where my Society wife may\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nSuffering there must be; but I must save myself, by any means in\r\nmy power, from one form of self-torture: I must never think that\r\nmy life loses its value because of any neglect it may suffer.\r\nThe full value of my life does not all go to buy my narrow\r\ndomestic world; its great commerce does not stand or fall with\r\nsome petty success or failure in the bartering of my personal\r\njoys and sorrows.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when I must divest Bimala of all the ideal\r\ndecorations with which I decked her.  It was owing to my own\r\nweakness that I indulged in such idolatry.  I was too greedy.  I\r\ncreated an angel of Bimala, in order to exaggerate my own\r\nenjoyment.  But Bimala is what she is.  It is preposterous to\r\nexpect that she should assume the rôle of an angel for my\r\npleasure.  The Creator is under no obligation to supply me with\r\nangels, just because I have an avidity for imaginary perfection.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge that I have merely been an accident in\r\nBimala's life.  Her nature, perhaps, can only find true union\r\nwith one like Sandip.  At the same time, I must not, in false\r\nmodesty, accept my rejection as my desert.  Sandip certainly has\r\nattractive qualities, which had their sway also upon myself; but\r\nyet, I feel sure, he is not a greater man than I.  If the wreath\r\nof victory falls to his lot today, and I am overlooked, then the\r\ndispenser of the wreath will be called to judgement.\r\n\r\nI say this in no spirit of boasting.  Sheer necessity has driven\r\nme to the pass, that to secure myself from utter desolation I\r\nmust recognize all the value that I truly possess.  Therefore,\r\nthrough the, terrible experience of suffering let there come upon\r\nme the joy of deliverance--deliverance from self-distrust.\r\n\r\nI have come to distinguish what is really in me from what I\r\nfoolishly imagined to be there.  The profit and loss account has\r\nbeen settled, and that which remains is myself--not a crippled\r\nself, dressed in rags and tatters, not a sick self to be nursed\r\non invalid diet, but a spirit which has gone through the worst,\r\nand has survived.\r\n\r\nMy master passed through my room a moment ago and said with his\r\nhand on my shoulder.  \"Get away to bed, Nikhil, the night is far\r\nadvanced.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, it has become so difficult for me to go to bed till\r\nlate--till Bimal is fast asleep.  In the day-time we meet, and\r\neven converse, but what am I to say when we are alone together,\r\nin the silence of the night?--so ashamed do I feel in mind and\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"How is it, sir, you have not yet retired?\"  I asked in my turn.\r\nMy master smiled a little, as he left me, saying: \"My sleeping\r\ndays are over.  I have now attained the waking age.\"\r\n\r\nI had written thus far, and was about to rise to go off bedwards\r\nwhen, through the window before me, I saw the heavy pall of July\r\ncloud suddenly part a little, and a big star shine through.  It\r\nseemed to say to me: \"Dreamland ties are made, and dreamland ties\r\nare broken, but I am here for ever--the everlasting lamp of the\r\nbridal night.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once my heart was full with the thought that my Eternal\r\nLove was steadfastly waiting for me through the ages, behind the\r\nveil of material things.  Through many a life, in many a mirror,\r\nhave I seen her image--broken mirrors, crooked mirrors, dusty\r\nmirrors.  Whenever I have sought to make the mirror my very own,\r\nand shut it up within my box, I have lost sight of the image.\r\nBut what of that.  What have I to do with the mirror, or even the\r\nimage?\r\n\r\nMy beloved, your smile shall never fade, and every dawn there\r\nshall appear fresh for me the vermilion mark on your forehead!\r\n\r\n\"What childish cajolery of self-deception,\" mocks some devil from\r\nhis dark corner--\"silly prattle to make children quiet!\"\r\n\r\nThat may be.  But millions and millions of children, with their\r\nmillion cries, have to be kept quiet.  Can it be that all this\r\nmultitude is quieted with only a lie?  No, my Eternal Love cannot\r\ndeceive me, for she is true!\r\n\r\nShe is true; that is why I have seen her and shall see her so\r\noften, even in my mistakes, even through the thickest mist of\r\ntears.  I have seen her and lost her in the crowd of life's\r\nmarket-place, and found her again; and I shall find her once more\r\nwhen I have escaped through the loophole of death.\r\n\r\nAh, cruel one, play with me no longer!  If I have failed to track\r\nyou by the marks of your footsteps on the way, by the scent of\r\nyour tresses lingering in the air, make me not weep for that for\r\never.  The unveiled star tells me not to fear.  That which is\r\neternal must always be there.\r\n\r\nNow let me go and see my Bimala.  She must have spread her tired\r\nlimbs on the bed, limp after her struggles, and be asleep.  I\r\nwill leave a kiss on her forehead without waking her--that shall\r\nbe the flower-offering of my worship.  I believe I could forget\r\neverything after death--all my mistakes, all my sufferings--but\r\nsome vibration of the memory of that kiss would remain; for the\r\nwreath which is being woven out of the kisses of many a\r\nsuccessive birth is to crown the Eternal Beloved.\r\n\r\nAs the gong of the watch rang out, sounding the hour of two, my\r\nsister-in-law came into the room.  \"Whatever are you doing,\r\nbrother dear?\"  [16] she cried.  \"For pity's sake go to bed and\r\nstop worrying so.  I cannot bear to look on that awful shadow of\r\npain on your face.\"  Tears welled up in her eyes and overflowed\r\nas she entreated me thus.\r\n\r\nI could not utter a word, but took the dust of her feet, as I\r\nwent off to bed.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n16. When a relationship is established by marriage, or by mutual\r\nunderstanding arising out of special friendship or affection, the\r\npersons so related call each other in terms of such relationship,\r\nand not by name.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first I suspected nothing, feared nothing; I simply felt\r\ndedicated to my country.  What a stupendous joy there was in this\r\nunquestioning surrender.  Verily had I realized how, in\r\nthoroughness of self-destruction, man can find supreme bliss.\r\n\r\nFor aught I know, this frenzy of mine might have come to a\r\ngradual, natural end.  But Sandip Babu would not have it so, he\r\nwould insist on revealing himself.  The tone of his voice became\r\nas intimate as a touch, every look flung itself on its knees in\r\nbeggary.  And, through it all, there burned a passion which in\r\nits violence made as though it would tear me up by the roots, and\r\ndrag me along by the hair.\r\n\r\nI will not shirk the truth.  This cataclysmal desire drew me by\r\nday and by night.  It seemed desperately alluring--this making\r\nhavoc of myself.  What a shame it seemed, how terrible, and yet\r\nhow sweet!  Then there was my overpowering curiosity, to which\r\nthere seemed no limit.  He of whom I knew but little, who never\r\ncould assuredly be mine, whose youth flared so vigorously in a\r\nhundred points of flame--oh, the mystery of his seething\r\npassions, so immense, so tumultuous!\r\n\r\nI began with a feeling of worship, but that soon passed away.  I\r\nceased even to respect Sandip; on the contrary, I began to look\r\ndown upon him.  Nevertheless this flesh-and-blood lute of mine,\r\nfashioned with my feeling and fancy, found in him a master-\r\nplayer.  What though I shrank from his touch, and even came to\r\nloathe the lute itself; its music was conjured up all the same.\r\n\r\nI must confess there was something in me which ...  what shall I\r\nsay?  ...  which makes me wish I could have died!\r\n\r\nChandranath Babu, when he finds leisure, comes to me.  He has the\r\npower to lift my mind up to an eminence from where I can see in a\r\nmoment the boundary of my life extended on all sides and so\r\nrealize that the lines, which I took from my bounds, were merely\r\nimaginary.\r\n\r\nBut what is the use of it all?  Do I really desire emancipation?\r\nLet suffering come to our house; let the best in me shrivel up\r\nand become black; but let this infatuation not leave me--such\r\nseems to be my prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen, before my marriage, I used to see a brother-in-law of mine,\r\nnow dead, mad with drink--beating his wife in his frenzy, and\r\nthen sobbing and howling in maudlin repentance, vowing never to\r\ntouch liquor again, and yet, the very same evening, sitting down\r\nto drink and drink--it would fill me with disgust.  But my\r\nintoxication today is still more fearful.  The stuff has not to\r\nbe procured or poured out: it springs within my veins, and I know\r\nnot how to resist it.\r\n\r\nMust this continue to the end of my days?  Now and again I start\r\nand look upon myself, and think my life to be a nightmare which\r\nwill vanish all of a sudden with all its untruth.  It has become\r\nso frightfully incongruous.  It has no connection with its past.\r\nWhat it is, how it could have come to this pass, I cannot\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nOne day my sister-in-law remarked with a cutting laugh: \"What a\r\nwonderfully hospitable Chota Rani we have!  Her guest absolutely\r\nwill not budge.  In our time there used to be guests, too; but\r\nthey had not such lavish looking after--we were so absurdly taken\r\nup with our husbands.  Poor brother Nikhil is paying the penalty\r\nof being born too modern.  He should have come as a guest if he\r\nwanted to stay on.  Now it looks as if it were time for him to\r\nquit ...  O you little demon, do your glances never fall, by\r\nchance, on his agonized face?\"\r\n\r\nThis sarcasm did not touch me; for I knew that these women had it\r\nnot in them to understand the nature of the cause of my devotion.\r\nI was then wrapped in the protecting armour of the exaltation of\r\nsacrifice, through which such shafts were powerless to reach and\r\nshame me.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time all talk of the country's cause has been dropped.\r\nOur conversation nowadays has become full of modern sex-problems,\r\nand various other matters, with a sprinkling of poetry, both old\r\nVaishnava and modern English, accompanied by a running undertone\r\nof melody, low down in the bass, such as I have never in my life\r\nheard before, which seems to me to sound the true manly note, the\r\nnote of power.\r\n\r\nThe day had come when all cover was gone.  There was no longer\r\neven the pretence of a reason why Sandip Babu should linger on,\r\nor why I should have confidential talks with him every now and\r\nthen.  I felt thoroughly vexed with myself, with my sister-in-\r\nlaw, with the ways of the world, and I vowed I would never again\r\ngo to the outer apartments, not if I were to die for it.\r\n\r\nFor two whole days I did not stir out.  Then, for the first time,\r\nI discovered how far I had travelled.  My life felt utterly\r\ntasteless.  Whatever I touched I wanted to thrust away.  I felt\r\nmyself waiting--from the crown of my head to the tips of my toes\r\n--waiting for something, somebody; my blood kept tingling with\r\nsome expectation.\r\n\r\nI tried busying myself with extra work.  The bedroom floor was\r\nclean enough but I insisted on its being scrubbed over again\r\nunder my eyes.  Things were arranged in the cabinets in one kind\r\nof order; I pulled them all out and rearranged them in a\r\ndifferent way.  I found no time that afternoon even to do up my\r\nhair; I hurriedly tied it into a loose knot, and went and worried\r\neverybody, fussing about the store-room.  The stores seemed\r\nshort, and pilfering must have been going on of late, but I could\r\nnot muster up the courage to take any particular person to task--\r\nfor might not the thought have crossed somebody's mind: \"Where\r\nwere your eyes all these days!\"\r\n\r\nIn short, I behaved that day as one possessed.  The next day I\r\ntried to do some reading.  What I read I have no idea, but after\r\na spell of absentmindedness I found I had wandered away, book in\r\nhand, along the passage leading towards the outer apartments, and\r\nwas standing by a window looking out upon the verandah running\r\nalong the row of rooms on the opposite side of the quadrangle.\r\nOne of these rooms, I felt, had crossed over to another shore,\r\nand the ferry had ceased to ply.  I felt like the ghost of myself\r\nof two days ago, doomed to remain where I was, and yet not really\r\nthere, blankly looking out for ever.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there, I saw Sandip come out of his room into the\r\nverandah, a newspaper in his hand.  I could see that he looked\r\nextraordinarily disturbed.  The courtyard, the railings, in\r\nfront, seemed to rouse his wrath.  He flung away his newspaper\r\nwith a gesture which seemed to want to rend the space before him.\r\n\r\nI felt I could no longer keep my vow.  I was about to move on\r\ntowards the sitting-room, when I found my sister-in-law behind\r\nme.  \"O Lord, this beats everything!\"  she ejaculated, as she\r\nglided away.  I could not proceed to the outer apartments.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when my maid came calling, \"Rani Mother, it is\r\ngetting late for giving out the stores,\" I flung the keys to her,\r\nsaying, \"Tell Harimati to see to it,\" and went on with some\r\nembroidery of English pattern on which I was engaged, seated near\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nThen came a servant with a letter.  \"From Sandip Babu,\" said he.\r\nWhat unbounded boldness!  What must the messenger have thought?\r\nThere was a tremor within my breast as I opened the envelope.\r\nThere was no address on the letter, only the words: __An urgent\r\nmatter--touching the Cause.  Sandip__.\r\n\r\nI flung aside the embroidery.  I was up on my feet in a moment,\r\ngiving a touch or two to my hair by the mirror.  I kept the\r\n__sari__ I had on, changing only my jacket--for one of my\r\njackets had its associations.\r\n\r\nI had to pass through one of the verandahs, where my sister-in-\r\nlaw used to sit in the morning slicing betel-nut.  I refused to\r\nfeel awkward.  \"Whither away, Chota Rani?\"  she cried.\r\n\r\n\"To the sitting-room outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"So early!  A matinée, eh?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as I passed on without further reply, she hummed after me a\r\nflippant song.\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was about to enter the sitting-room, I saw Sandip immersed\r\nin an illustrated catalogue of British Academy pictures, with his\r\nback to the door.  He has a great notion of himself as an expert\r\nin matters of Art.\r\n\r\nOne day my husband said to him: \"If the artists ever want a\r\nteacher, they need never lack for one so long as you are there.\"\r\nIt had not been my husband's habit to speak cuttingly, but\r\nlatterly there has been a change and he never spares Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you suppose that artists need no teachers?\"  Sandip\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n\"Art is a creation,\" my husband replied.  \"So we should humbly be\r\ncontent to receive our lessons about Art from the work of the\r\nartist.\"\r\n\r\nSandip laughed at this modesty, saying: \"You think that meekness\r\nis a kind of capital which increases your wealth the more you use\r\nit.  It is my conviction that those who lack pride only float\r\nabout like water reeds which have no roots in the soil.\"\r\n\r\nMy mind used to be full of contradictions when they talked thus.\r\nOn the one hand I was eager that my husband should win in\r\nargument and that Sandip's pride should be shamed.  Yet, on the\r\nother, it was Sandip's unabashed pride which attracted me so.  It\r\nshone like a precious diamond, which knows no diffidence, and\r\nsparkles in the face of the sun itself.\r\n\r\nI entered the room.  I knew Sandip could hear my footsteps as I\r\nwent forward, but he pretended not to, and kept his eyes on the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nI dreaded his Art talks, for I could not overcome my delicacy\r\nabout the pictures he talked of, and the things he said, and had\r\nmuch ado in putting on an air of overdone insensibility to hide\r\nmy qualms.  So, I was almost on the point of retracing my steps,\r\nwhen, with a deep sigh, Sandip raised his eyes, and affected to\r\nbe startled at the sight of me.  \"Ah, you have come!\"  he said.\r\n\r\nIn his words, in his tone, in his eyes, there was a world of\r\nsuppressed reproach, as if the claims he had acquired over me\r\nmade my absence, even for these two or three days, a grievous\r\nwrong.  I knew this attitude was an insult to me, but, alas, I\r\nhad not the power to resent it.\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but though I was looking another way, I could\r\nnot help feeling that Sandip's plaintive gaze had planted itself\r\nright on my face, and would take no denial.  I did so wish he\r\nwould say something, so that I could shelter myself behind his\r\nwords.  I cannot tell how long this went on, but at last I could\r\nstand it no longer.  \"What is this matter,\" I asked, \"you are\r\nwanting to tell me about?\"\r\n\r\nSandip again affected surprise as he said: \"Must there always be\r\nsome matter?  Is friendship by itself a crime?  Oh, Queen Bee, to\r\nthink that you should make so light of the greatest thing on\r\nearth!  Is the heart's worship to be shut out like a stray cur?\"\r\n\r\nThere was again that tremor within me.  I could feel the crisis\r\ncoming, too importunate to be put off.  Joy and fear struggled\r\nfor the mastery.  Would my shoulders, I wondered, be broad enough\r\nto stand its shock, or would it not leave me overthrown, with my\r\nface in the dust?\r\n\r\nI was trembling all over.  Steadying myself with an effort I\r\nrepeated: \"You summoned me for something touching the Cause, so I\r\nhave left my household duties to attend to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I was trying to explain,\" he said, with a dry\r\nlaugh.  \"Do you not know that I come to worship?  Have I not told\r\nyou that, in you, I visualize the __Shakti__ of our country?\r\nThe Geography of a country is not the whole truth.  No one can\r\ngive up his life for a map!  When I see you before me, then only\r\ndo I realize how lovely my country is.  When you have anointed me\r\nwith your own hands, then shall I know I have the sanction of my\r\ncountry; and if, with that in my heart, I fall fighting, it shall\r\nnot be on the dust of some map-made land, but on a lovingly\r\nspread skirt--do you know what kind of skirt?--like that of the\r\nearthen-red __sari__ you wore the other day, with a broad\r\nblood-red border.  Can I ever forget it?  Such are the visions\r\nwhich give vigour to life, and joy to death!\"\r\n\r\nSandip's eyes took fire as he went on, but whether it was the\r\nfire of worship, or of passion, I could not tell.  I was reminded\r\nof the day on which I first heard him speak, when I could not be\r\nsure whether he was a person, or just a living flame.\r\n\r\nI had not the power to utter a word.  You cannot take shelter\r\nbehind the walls of decorum when in a moment the fire leaps up\r\nand, with the flash of its sword and the roar of its laughter,\r\ndestroys all the miser's stores.  I was in terror lest he should\r\nforget himself and take me by the hand.  For he shook like a\r\nquivering tongue of fire; his eyes showered scorching sparks on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Are you for ever determined,\" he cried after a pause, \"to make\r\ngods of your petty household duties--you who have it in you to\r\nsend us to life or to death?  Is this power of yours to be kept\r\nveiled in a zenana?  Cast away all false shame, I pray you; snap\r\nyour fingers at the whispering around.  Take your plunge today\r\ninto the freedom of the outer world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in Sandip's appeals, his worship of the country gets to be\r\nsubtly interwoven with his worship of me, then does my blood\r\ndance, indeed, and the barriers of my hesitation totter.  His\r\ntalks about Art and Sex, his distinctions between Real and\r\nUnreal, had but clogged my attempts at response with some\r\nrevolting nastiness.  This, however, now burst again into a glow\r\nbefore which my repugnance faded away.  I felt that my\r\nresplendent womanhood made me indeed a goddess.  Why should not\r\nits glory flash from my forehead with visible brilliance?  Why\r\ndoes not my voice find a word, some audible cry, which would be\r\nlike a sacred spell to my country for its fire initiation?\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden my maid Khema rushed into the room, dishevelled.\r\n\"Give me my wages and let me go,\" she screamed.  \"Never in all my\r\nlife have I been so ...\"  The rest of her speech was drowned in\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nThako, the Bara Rani's maid, it appeared, had for no rhyme or\r\nreason reviled her in unmeasured terms.  She was in such a state,\r\nit was no manner of use trying to pacify her by saying I would\r\nlook into the matter afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe slime of domestic life that lay beneath the lotus bank of\r\nwomanhood came to the surface.  Rather than allow Sandip a\r\nprolonged vision of it, I had to hurry back within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law was absorbed in her betel-nuts, the suspicion of\r\na smile playing about her lips, as if nothing untoward had\r\nhappened.  She was still humming the same song.\r\n\r\n\"Why has your Thako been calling poor Khema names?\"  I burst out.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?  The wretch!  I will have her broomed out of the house.\r\nWhat a shame to spoil your morning out like this!  As for Khema,\r\nwhere are the hussy's manners to go and disturb you when you are\r\nengaged?  Anyhow, Chota Rani, don't you worry yourself with these\r\ndomestic squabbles.  Leave them to me, and return to your\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nHow suddenly the wind in the sails of our mind veers round!  This\r\ngoing to meet Sandip outside seemed, in the light of the zenana\r\ncode, such an extraordinarily out-of-the-way thing to do that I\r\nwent off to my own room, at a loss for a reply.  I knew this was\r\nmy sister-in-law's doing and that she had egged her maid on to\r\ncontrive this scene.  But I had brought myself to such an\r\nunstable poise that I dared not have my fling.\r\n\r\nWhy, it was only the other day that I found I could not keep up\r\nto the last the unbending hauteur with which I had demanded from\r\nmy husband the dismissal of the man Nanku.  I felt suddenly\r\nabashed when the Bara Rani came up and said: \"It is really all my\r\nfault, brother dear.  We are old-fashioned folk, and I did not\r\nquite like the ways of your Sandip Babu, so I only told the guard\r\n...  but how was I to know that our Chota Rani would take this as\r\nan insult?--I thought it would be the other way about!  Just my\r\nincorrigible silliness!\"\r\n\r\nThe thing which seems so glorious when viewed from the heights of\r\nthe country's cause, looks so muddy when seen from the bottom.\r\nOne begins by getting angry, and then feels disgusted.\r\n\r\nI shut myself into my room, sitting by the window, thinking how\r\neasy life would be if only one could keep in harmony with one's\r\nsurroundings.  How simply the senior Rani sits in her verandah\r\nwith her betel-nuts and how inaccessible to me has become my\r\nnatural seat beside my daily duties!  Where will it all end, I\r\nasked myself?  Shall I ever recover, as from a delirium, and\r\nforget it all; or am I to be dragged to depths from which there\r\ncan be no escape in this life?  How on earth did I manage to let\r\nmy good fortune escape me, and spoil my life so?  Every wall of\r\nthis bedroom of mine, which I first entered nine years ago as a\r\nbride, stares at me in dismay.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband came home, after his M.A.  examination, he\r\nbrought for me this orchid belonging to some far-away land beyond\r\nthe seas.  From beneath these few little leaves sprang such a\r\ncascade of blossoms, it looked as if they were pouring forth from\r\nsome overturned urn of Beauty.  We decided, together, to hang it\r\nhere, over this window.  It flowered only that once, but we have\r\nalways been in hope of its doing so once more.  Curiously enough\r\nI have kept on watering it these days, from force of habit, and\r\nit is still green.\r\n\r\nIt is now four years since I framed a photograph of my husband in\r\nivory and put it in the niche over there.  If I happen to look\r\nthat way I have to lower my eyes.  Up to last week I used\r\nregularly to put there the flowers of my worship, every morning\r\nafter my bath.  My husband has often chided me over this.\r\n\r\n\"It shames me to see you place me on a height to which I do not\r\nbelong,\" he said one day.\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not only ashamed, but also jealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just hear him!  Jealous of whom, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that false me.  It only shows that I am too petty for you,\r\nthat you want some extraordinary man who can overpower you with\r\nhis superiority, and so you needs must take refuge in making for\r\nyourself another 'me'.\"\r\n\r\n\"This kind of talk only makes me angry,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What is the use of being angry with me?\"  he replied.  \"Blame\r\nyour fate which allowed you no choice, but made you take me\r\nblindfold.  This keeps you trying to retrieve its blunder by\r\nmaking me out a paragon.\"\r\n\r\nI felt so hurt at the bare idea that tears started to my eyes\r\nthat day.  And whenever I think of that now, I cannot raise my\r\neyes to the niche.\r\n\r\nFor now there is another photograph in my jewel case.  The other\r\nday, when arranging the sitting-room, I brought away that double\r\nphoto frame, the one in which Sandip's portrait was next to my\r\nhusband's.  To this portrait I have no flowers of worship to\r\noffer, but it remains hidden away under my gems.  It has all the\r\ngreater fascination because kept secret.  I look at it now and\r\nthen with doors closed.  At night I turn up the lamp, and sit\r\nwith it in my hand, gazing and gazing.  And every night I think\r\nof burning it in the flame of the lamp, to be done with it for\r\never; but every night I heave a sigh and smother it again in my\r\npearls and diamonds.\r\n\r\nAh, wretched woman!  What a wealth of love was twined round each\r\none of those jewels!  Oh, why am I not dead?\r\n\r\nSandip had impressed it on me that hesitation is not in the\r\nnature of woman.  For her, neither right nor left has any\r\nexistence--she only moves forward.  When the women of our country\r\nwake up, he repeatedly insisted, their voice will be unmistakably\r\nconfident in its utterance of the cry: \"I want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want!\"  Sandip went on one day--this was the primal word at\r\nthe root of all creation.  It had no maxim to guide it, but it\r\nbecame fire and wrought itself into suns and stars.  Its\r\npartiality is terrible.  Because it had a desire for man, it\r\nruthlessly sacrificed millions of beasts for millions of years to\r\nachieve that desire.  That terrible word \"I want\" has taken flesh\r\nin woman, and therefore men, who are cowards, try with all their\r\nmight to keep back this primeval flood With their earthen dykes.\r\nThey are afraid lest, laughing and dancing as it goes, it should\r\nwash away all the hedges and props of their pumpkin field.  Men,\r\nin every age, flatter themselves that they have secured this\r\nforce within the bounds of their convenience, but it gathers and\r\ngrows.  Now it is calm and deep like a lake, but gradually its\r\npressure will increase, the dykes will give way, and the force\r\nwhich has so long been dumb will rush forward with the roar: \"I\r\nwant!\"\r\n\r\nThese words of Sandip echo in my heart-beats like a war-drum.\r\nThey shame into silence all my conflicts with myself.  What do I\r\ncare what people may think of me?  Of what value are that orchid\r\nand that niche in my bedroom?  What power have they to belittle\r\nme, to put me to shame?  The primal fire of creation burns in me.\r\n\r\nI felt a strong desire to snatch down the orchid and fling it out\r\nof the window, to denude the niche of its picture, to lay bare\r\nand naked the unashamed spirit of destruction that raged within\r\nme.  My arm was raised to do it, but a sudden pang passed through\r\nmy breast, tears started to my eyes.  I threw myself down and\r\nsobbed: \"What is the end of all this, what is the end?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandip's Story\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I read these pages of the story of my life I seriously\r\nquestion myself: Is this Sandip?  Am I made of words?  Am I\r\nmerely a book with a covering of flesh and blood?\r\n\r\nThe earth is not a dead thing like the moon.  She breathes.  Her\r\nrivers and oceans send up vapours in which she is clothed.  She\r\nis covered with a mantle of her own dust which flies about the\r\nair.  The onlooker, gazing upon the earth from the outside, can\r\nsee only the light reflected from this vapour and this dust.  The\r\ntracks of the mighty continents are not distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nThe man, who is alive as this earth is, is likewise always\r\nenveloped in the mist of the ideas which he is breathing out.\r\nHis real land and water remain hidden, and he appears to be made\r\nof only lights and shadows.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, in this story of my life, that, like a living\r\nplant, I am displaying the picture of an ideal world.  But I am\r\nnot merely what I want, what I think--I am also what I do not\r\nlove, what I do not wish to be.  My creation had begun before I\r\nwas born.  I had no choice in regard to my surroundings and so\r\nmust make the best of such material as comes to my hand.\r\n\r\nMy theory of life makes me certain that the Great is cruel To be\r\njust is for ordinary men--it is reserved for the great to be\r\nunjust.  The surface of the earth was even.  The volcano butted\r\nit with its fiery horn and found its own eminence--its justice\r\nwas not towards its obstacle, but towards itself.  Successful\r\ninjustice and genuine cruelty have been the only forces by which\r\nindividual or nation has become millionaire or monarch.\r\n\r\nThat is why I preach the great discipline of Injustice.  I say to\r\neveryone: Deliverance is based upon injustice.  Injustice is the\r\nfire which must keep on burning something in order to save itself\r\nfrom becoming ashes.  Whenever an individual or nation becomes\r\nincapable of perpetrating injustice it is swept into the dust-bin\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAs yet this is only my idea--it is not completely myself.  There\r\nare rifts in the armour through which something peeps out which\r\nis extremely soft and sensitive.  Because, as I say, the best\r\npart of myself was created before I came to this stage of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I try my followers in their lesson of cruelty.\r\nOne day we went on a picnic.  A goat was grazing by.  I asked\r\nthem: \"Who is there among you that can cut off a leg of that\r\ngoat, alive, with this knife, and bring it to me?\"  While they\r\nall hesitated, I went myself and did it.  One of them fainted at\r\nthe sight.  But when they saw me unmoved they took the dust of my\r\nfeet, saying that I was above all human weaknesses.  That is to\r\nsay, they saw that day the vaporous envelope which was my idea,\r\nbut failed to perceive the inner me, which by a curious freak of\r\nfate has been created tender and merciful.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter of my life, which is growing in interest\r\nevery day round Bimala and Nikhil, there is also much that\r\nremains hidden underneath.  This malady of ideas which afflicts\r\nme is shaping my life within: nevertheless a great part of my\r\nlife remains outside its influence; and so there is set up a\r\ndiscrepancy between my outward life and its inner design which I\r\ntry my best to keep concealed even from myself; otherwise it may\r\nwreck not only my plans, but my very life.\r\n\r\nLife is indefinite--a bundle of contradictions.  We men, with our\r\nideas, strive to give it a particular shape by melting it into a\r\nparticular mould--into the definiteness of success.  All the\r\nworld-conquerors, from Alexander down to the American\r\nmillionaires, mould themselves into a sword or a mint, and thus\r\nfind that distinct image of themselves which is the source of\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nThe chief controversy between Nikhil and myself arises from this:\r\nthat though I say \"know thyself\", and Nikhil also says \"know\r\nthyself\", his interpretation makes this \"knowing\" tantamount to\r\n\"not knowing\".\r\n\r\n\"Winning your kind of success,\" Nikhil once objected, \"is success\r\ngained at the cost of the soul: but the soul is greater than\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\nI simply said in answer: \"Your words are too vague.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot help,\" Nikhil replied.  \"A machine is distinct\r\nenough, but not so life.  If to gain distinctness you try to know\r\nlife as a machine, then such mere distinctness cannot stand for\r\ntruth.  The soul is not as distinct as success, and so you only\r\nlose your soul if you seek it in your success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, is this wonderful soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where it knows itself in the infinite and transcends its\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how does all this apply to our work for the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same thing.  Where our country makes itself the final\r\nobject, it gains success at the cost of the soul.  Where it\r\nrecognizes the Greatest as greater than all, there it may miss\r\nsuccess, but gains its soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any example of this in history?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man is so great that he can despise not only the success, but\r\nalso the example.  Possibly example is lacking, just as there is\r\nno example of the flower in the seed.  But there is the urgence\r\nof the flower in the seed all the same.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not that I do not at all understand Nikhil's point of view;\r\nthat is rather where my danger lies.  I was born in India and the\r\npoison of its spirituality runs in my blood.  However loudly I\r\nmay proclaim the madness of walking in the path of self-\r\nabnegation, I cannot avoid it altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly how such curious anomalies happen nowadays in our\r\ncountry.  We must have our religion and also our nationalism; our\r\n__Bhagavadgita__ and also our __Bande Mataram__.  The result is that\r\nboth of them suffer.  It is like performing with an English military\r\nband, side by side with our Indian festive pipes.  I must make it\r\nthe purpose of my life to put an end to this hideous confusion.\r\n\r\nI want the western military style to prevail, not the Indian.\r\nWe shall then not be ashamed of the flag of our passion, which\r\nmother Nature has sent with us as our standard into the\r\nbattlefield of life.  Passion is beautiful and pure--pure as the\r\nlily that comes out of the slimy soil.  It rises superior to its\r\ndefilement and needs no Pears' soap to wash it clean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nA question has been worrying me the last few days.  Why am I\r\nallowing my life to become entangled with Bimala's?  Am I a\r\ndrifting log to be caught up at any and every obstacle?\r\n\r\nNot that I have any false shame at Bimala becoming an object of\r\nmy desire.  It is only too clear how she wants me, and so I look\r\non her as quite legitimately mine.  The fruit hangs on the branch\r\nby the stem, but that is no reason why the claim of the stem\r\nshould be eternal.  Ripe fruit cannot for ever swear by its\r\nslackening stem-hold.  All its sweetness has been accumulated for\r\nme; to surrender itself to my hand is the reason of its\r\nexistence, its very nature, its true morality.  So I must pluck\r\nit, for it becomes me not to make it futile.\r\n\r\nBut what is teasing me is that I am getting entangled.  Am I not\r\nborn to rule?--to bestride my proper steed, the crowd, and drive\r\nit as I will; the reins in my hand, the destination known only to\r\nme, and for it the thorns, the mire, on the road?  This steed now\r\nawaits me at the door, pawing and champing its bit, its neighing\r\nfilling the skies.  But where am I, and what am I about, letting\r\nday after day of golden opportunity slip by?\r\n\r\nI used to think I was like a storm--that the torn flowers with\r\nwhich I strewed my path would not impede my progress.  But I am\r\nonly wandering round and round a flower like a bee--not a storm.\r\nSo, as I was saying, the colouring of ideas which man gives\r\nhimself is only superficial.  The inner man remains as ordinary\r\nas ever.  If someone, who could see right into me, were to write\r\nmy biography, he would make me out to be no different from that\r\nlout of a Panchu, or even from Nikhil!\r\n\r\nLast night I was turning over the pages of my old diary ...  I\r\nhad just graduated, and my brain was bursting with philosophy.\r\nEven so early I had vowed not to harbour any illusions, whether\r\nof my own or other's imagining, but to build my life on a solid\r\nbasis of reality.  But what has since been its actual story?\r\nWhere is its solidity?  It has rather been a network, where,\r\nthough the thread be continuous, more space is taken up by the\r\nholes.  Fight as I may, these will not own defeat.  Just as I was\r\ncongratulating myself on steadily following the thread, here I am\r\nbadly caught in a hole!  For I have become susceptible to\r\ncompunctions.\r\n\r\n\"I want it; it is here; let me take it\"--This is a clear-cut,\r\nstraightforward policy.  Those who can pursue its course with\r\nvigour needs must win through in the end.  But the gods would not\r\nhave it that such journey should be easy, so they have deputed\r\nthe siren Sympathy to distract the wayfarer, to dim his vision\r\nwith her tearful mist.\r\n\r\nI can see that poor Bimala is struggling like a snared deer.\r\nWhat a piteous alarm there is in her eyes!  How she is torn with\r\nstraining at her bonds!  This sight, of course, should gladden\r\nthe heart of a true hunter.  And so do I rejoice; but, then, I am\r\nalso touched; and therefore I dally, and standing on the brink I\r\nam hesitating to pull the noose fast.\r\n\r\nThere have been moments, I know, when I could have bounded up to\r\nher, clasped her hands and folded her to my breast, unresisting.\r\nHad I done so, she would not have said one word.  She was aware\r\nthat some crisis was impending, which in a moment would change\r\nthe meaning of the whole world.  Standing before that cavern of\r\nthe incalculable but yet expected, her face went pale and her\r\neyes glowed with a fearful ecstasy.  Within that moment, when it\r\narrives, an eternity will take shape, which our destiny awaits,\r\nholding its breath.\r\n\r\nBut I have let this moment slip by.  I did not, with\r\nuncompromising strength, press the almost certain into the\r\nabsolutely assured.  I now see clearly that some hidden elements\r\nin my nature have openly ranged themselves as obstacles in my\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly how Ravana, whom I look upon as the real hero of\r\nthe __Ramayana__, met with his doom.  He kept Sita in his\r\nAsoka garden, awaiting her pleasure, instead of taking her\r\nstraight into his harem.  This weak spot in his otherwise grand\r\ncharacter made the whole of the abduction episode futile.\r\nAnother such touch of compunction made him disregard, and be\r\nlenient to, his traitorous brother Bibhisan, only to get himself\r\nkilled for his pains.\r\n\r\nThus does the tragic in life come by its own.  In the beginning\r\nit lies, a little thing, in some dark under-vault, and ends by\r\noverthrowing the whole superstructure.  The real tragedy is, that\r\nman does not know himself for what he really is.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen again there is Nikhil.  Crank though he be, laugh at him as\r\nI may, I cannot get rid of the idea that he is my friend.  At\r\nfirst I gave no thought to his point of view, but of late it has\r\nbegun to shame and hurt me.  Therefore I have been trying to talk\r\nand argue with him in the same enthusiastic way as of old, but it\r\ndoes not ring true.  It is even leading me at times into such a\r\nlength of unnaturalness as to pretend to agree with him.  But\r\nsuch hypocrisy is not in my nature, nor in that of Nikhil either.\r\nThis, at least, is something we have in common.  That is why,\r\nnowadays, I would rather not come across him, and have taken to\r\nfighting shy of his presence.\r\n\r\nAll these are signs of weakness.  No sooner is the possibility of\r\na wrong admitted than it becomes actual, and clutches you by the\r\nthroat, however you may then try to shake off all belief in it.\r\nWhat I should like to be able to tell Nikhil frankly is, that\r\nhappenings such as these must be looked in the face--as great\r\nRealities--and that which is the Truth should not be allowed to\r\nstand between true friends.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that I have really weakened.  It was not this\r\nweakness which won over Bimala; she burnt her wings in the blaze\r\nof the full strength of my unhesitating manliness.  Whenever\r\nsmoke obscures its lustre she also becomes confused, and draws\r\nback.  Then comes a thorough revulsion of feeling, and she fain\r\nwould take back the garland she has put round my neck, but\r\ncannot; and so she only closes her eyes, to shut it out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut all the same I must not swerve from the path I have chalked\r\nout.  It would never do to abandon the cause of the country,\r\nespecially at the present time.  I shall simply make Bimala one\r\nwith my country.  The turbulent west wind which has swept away\r\nthe country's veil of conscience, will sweep away the veil of the\r\nwife from Bimala's face, and in that uncovering there will be no\r\nshame.  The ship will rock as it bears the crowd across the\r\nocean, flying the pennant of __Bande Mataram__, and it will\r\nserve as the cradle to my power, as well as to my love.\r\n\r\nBimala will see such a majestic vision of deliverance, that her\r\nbonds will slip from about her, without shame, without her even\r\nbeing aware of it.  Fascinated by the beauty of this terrible\r\nwrecking power, she will not hesitate a moment to be cruel.  I\r\nhave seen in Bimala's nature the cruelty which is the inherent\r\nforce of existence--the cruelty which with its unrelenting might\r\nkeeps the world beautiful.\r\n\r\nIf only women could be set free from the artificial fetters put\r\nround them by men, we could see on earth the living image of\r\nKali, the shameless, pitiless goddess.  I am a worshipper of\r\nKali, and one day I shall truly worship her, setting Bimala on\r\nher altar of Destruction.  For this let me get ready.\r\n\r\nThe way of retreat is absolutely closed for both of us.  We shall\r\ndespoil each other: get to hate each other: but never more be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Five\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERYTHING is rippling and waving with the flood of August.  The\r\nyoung shoots of rice have the sheen of an infant's limbs.  The\r\nwater has invaded the garden next to our house.  The morning\r\nlight, like the love of the blue sky, is lavished upon the earth\r\n...  Why cannot I sing?  The water of the distant river is\r\nshimmering with light; the leaves are glistening; the rice-\r\nfields, with their fitful shivers, break into gleams of gold; and\r\nin this symphony of Autumn, only I remain voiceless.  The\r\nsunshine of the world strikes my heart, but is not reflected\r\nback.\r\n\r\nWhen I realize the lack of expressiveness in myself, I know why I\r\nam deprived.  Who could bear my company day and night without a\r\nbreak?  Bimala is full of the energy of life, and so she has\r\nnever become stale to me for a moment, in all these nine years of\r\nour wedded life.\r\n\r\nMy life has only its dumb depths; but no murmuring rush.  I can\r\nonly receive: not impart movement.  And therefore my company is\r\nlike fasting.  I recognize clearly today that Bimala has been\r\nlanguishing because of a famine of companionship.\r\n\r\nThen whom shall I blame?  Like Vidyapati I can only lament:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  It is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;\r\n  Alas, empty is my house.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nMy house, I now see, was built to remain empty, because its doors\r\ncannot open.  But I never knew till now that its divinity had\r\nbeen sitting outside.  I had fondly believed that she had\r\naccepted my sacrifice, and granted in return her boon.  But,\r\nalas, my house has all along been empty.\r\n\r\nEvery year, about this time, it was our practice to go in a\r\nhouse-boat over the broads of Samalda.  I used to tell Bimala\r\nthat a song must come back to its refrain over and over again.\r\nThe original refrain of every song is in Nature, where the rain-\r\nladen wind passes over the rippling stream, where the green\r\nearth, drawing its shadow-veil over its face, keeps its ear close\r\nto the speaking water.  There, at the beginning of time, a man\r\nand a woman first met--not within walls.  And therefore we two\r\nmust come back to Nature, at least once a year, to tune our love\r\nanew to the first pure note of the meeting of hearts.\r\n\r\nThe first two anniversaries of our married life I spent in\r\nCalcutta, where I went through my examinations.  But from the\r\nnext year onwards, for seven years without a break, we have\r\ncelebrated our union among the blossoming water-lilies.  Now\r\nbegins the next octave of my life.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for me to ignore the fact that the same month of\r\nAugust had come round again this year.  Does Bimala remember it,\r\nI wonder?--she has given me no reminder.  Everything is mute\r\nabout me.\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  It is August, the sky breaks into a passionate rain;\r\n  Alas, empty is my house.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nThe house which becomes empty through the parting of lovers,\r\nstill has music left in the heart of its emptiness.  But the\r\nhouse that is empty because hearts are asunder, is awful in its\r\nsilence.  Even the cry of pain is out of place there.\r\n\r\nThis cry of pain must be silenced in me.  So long as I continue\r\nto suffer, Bimala will never have true freedom.  I must free her\r\ncompletely, otherwise I shall never gain my freedom from untruth\r\n...\r\n\r\nI think I have come to the verge of understanding one thing.  Man\r\nhas so fanned the flame of the loves of men and women, as to make\r\nit overpass its rightful domain, and now, even in the name of\r\nhumanity itself, he cannot bring it back under control.  Man's\r\nworship has idolized his passion.  But there must be no more\r\nhuman sacrifices at its shrine ...\r\n\r\nI went into my bedroom this morning, to fetch a book.  It is long\r\nsince I have been there in the day-time.  A pang passed through\r\nme as I looked round it today, in the morning light.  On the\r\nclothes rack was hanging a __sari__ of Bimala's, crinkled\r\nready for wear.  On the dressing-table were her perfumes, her\r\ncomb, her hair-pins, and with them, still, her vermilion box!\r\nUnderneath were her tiny gold-embroidered slippers.\r\n\r\nOnce, in the old days, when Bimala had not yet overcome her\r\nobjections to shoes, I had got these out from Lucknow, to tempt\r\nher.  The first time she was ready to drop for very shame, to go\r\nin them even from the room to the verandah.  Since then she has\r\nworn out many shoes, but has treasured up this pair.  When first\r\nshowing her the slippers, I chaffed her over a curious practice\r\nof hers; \"I have caught you taking the dust of my feet, thinking\r\nme asleep!  These are the offerings of my worship to ward the\r\ndust off the feet of my wakeful divinity.\"  \"You must not say\r\nsuch things,\" she protested, \"or I will never wear your shoes!\"\r\n\r\nThis bedroom of mine--it has a subtle atmosphere which goes\r\nstraight to my heart.  I was never aware, as I am today, how my\r\nthirsting heart has been sending out its roots to cling round\r\neach and every familiar object.  The severing of the main root, I\r\nsee, is not enough to set life free.  Even these little slippers\r\nserve to hold one back.\r\n\r\nMy wandering eyes fall on the niche.  My portrait there is\r\nlooking the same as ever, in spite of the flowers scattered round\r\nit having been withered black!  Of all the things in the room\r\ntheir greeting strikes me as sincere.  They are still here simply\r\nbecause it was not felt worth while even to remove them.  Never\r\nmind; let me welcome truth, albeit in such sere and sorry garb,\r\nand look forward to the time when I shall be able to do so\r\nunmoved, as does my photograph.\r\n\r\nAs I stood there, Bimal came in from behind.  I hastily turned my\r\neyes from the niche to the shelves as I muttered: \"I came to get\r\nAmiel's Journal.\"  What need had Ito volunteer an explanation?  I\r\nfelt like a wrong-doer, a trespasser, prying into a secret not\r\nmeant for me.  I could not look Bimal in the face, but hurried\r\naway.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had just made the discovery that it was useless to keep up a\r\npretence of reading in my room outside, and also that it was\r\nequally beyond me to busy myself attending to anything at all--so\r\nthat all the days of my future bid fair to congeal into one solid\r\nmass and settle heavily on my breast for good--when Panchu, the\r\ntenant of a neighbouring __zamindar__, came up to me with a\r\nbasketful of cocoa-nuts and greeted me with a profound obeisance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Panchu,\" said I.  \"What is all this for?\"\r\n\r\nI had got to know Panchu through my master.  He was extremely\r\npoor, nor was I in a position to do anything for him; so I\r\nsupposed this present was intended to procure a tip to help the\r\npoor fellow to make both ends meet.  I took some money from my\r\npurse and held it out towards him, but with folded hands he\r\nprotested: \"I cannot take that, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me make a clean breast of it, sir.  Once, when I was hard\r\npressed, I stole some cocoa-nuts from the garden here.  I am\r\ngetting old, and may die any day, so I have come to pay them\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nAmiel's Journal could not have done me any good that day.  But\r\nthese words of Panchu lightened my heart.  There are more things\r\nin life than the union or separation of man and woman.  The great\r\nworld stretches far beyond, and one can truly measure one's joys\r\nand sorrows when standing in its midst.\r\n\r\nPanchu was devoted to my master.  I know well enough how he\r\nmanages to eke out a livelihood.  He is up before dawn every day,\r\nand with a basket of __pan__ leaves, twists of tobacco,\r\ncoloured cotton yarn, little combs, looking-glasses, and other\r\ntrinkets beloved of the village women, he wades through the knee-\r\ndeep water of the marsh and goes over to the Namasudra quarters.\r\nThere he barters his goods for rice, which fetches him a little\r\nmore than their price in money.  If he can get back soon enough\r\nhe goes out again, after a hurried meal, to the sweetmeat\r\nseller's, where he assists in beating sugar for wafers.  As soon\r\nas he comes home he sits at his shell-bangle making, plodding on\r\noften till midnight.  All this cruel toil does not earn, for\r\nhimself and his family, a bare two meals a day during much more\r\nthan half the year.  His method of eating is to begin with a good\r\nfilling draught of water, and his staple food is the cheapest\r\nkind of seedy banana.  And yet the family has to go with only one\r\nmeal a day for the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nAt one time I had an idea of making him a charity allowance,\r\n\"But,\" said my master, \"your gift may destroy the man, it cannot\r\ndestroy the hardship of his lot.  Mother Bengal has not only this\r\none Panchu.  If the milk in her breasts has run dry, that cannot\r\nbe supplied from the outside.\"\r\n\r\nThese are thoughts which give one pause, and I decided to devote\r\nmyself to working it out.  That very day I said to Bimal: \"Let us\r\ndedicate our lives to removing the root of this sorrow in our\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are my Prince Siddharta, [17] I see,\" she replied with a\r\nsmile.  \"But do not let the torrent of your feelings end by\r\nsweeping me away also!\"\r\n\r\n\"Siddharta took his vows alone.  I want ours to be a joint\r\narrangement.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea passed away in talk.  The fact is, Bimala is at heart\r\nwhat is called a \"lady\".  Though her own people are not well off,\r\nshe was born a Rani.  She has no doubts in her mind that there is\r\na lower unit of measure for the trials and troubles of the \"lower\r\nclasses\".  Want is, of course, a permanent feature of their\r\nlives, but does not necessarily mean \"want\" to them.  Their very\r\nsmallness protects them, as the banks protect the pool; by\r\nwidening bounds only the slime is exposed.\r\n\r\nThe real fact is that Bimala has only come into my home, not into\r\nmy life.  I had magnified her so, leaving her such a large place,\r\nthat when I lost her, my whole way of life became narrow and\r\nconfined.  I had thrust aside all other objects into a corner to\r\nmake room for Bimala--taken up as I was with decorating her and\r\ndressing her and educating her and moving round her day and\r\nnight; forgetting how great is humanity and how nobly precious is\r\nman's life.  When the actualities of everyday things get the\r\nbetter of the man, then is Truth lost sight of and freedom\r\nmissed.  So painfully important did Bimala make the mere\r\nactualities, that the truth remained concealed from me.  That is\r\nwhy I find no gap in my misery, and spread this minute point of\r\nmy emptiness over all the world.  And so, for hours on this\r\nAutumn morning, the refrain has been humming in my ears:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  It is the month of August, and the sky breaks into a passionate\r\n    rain;\r\n  Alas, my house is empty.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n17. The name by which Buddha was known when a Prince, before\r\nrenouncing the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change which had, in a moment, come over the mind of Bengal\r\nwas tremendous.  It was as if the Ganges had touched the ashes of\r\nthe sixty thousand sons of Sagar [18] which no fire could\r\nenkindle, no other water knead again into living clay.  The ashes\r\nof lifeless Bengal suddenly spoke up: \"Here am I.\"\r\n\r\nI have read somewhere that in ancient Greece a sculptor had the\r\ngood fortune to impart life to the image made by his own hand.\r\nEven in that miracle, however, there was the process of form\r\npreceding life.  But where was the unity in this heap of barren\r\nashes?  Had they been hard like stone, we might have had hopes of\r\nsome form emerging, even as Ahalya, though turned to stone, at\r\nlast won back her humanity.  But these scattered ashes must have\r\ndropped to the dust through gaps in the Creator's fingers, to be\r\nblown hither and thither by the wind.  They had become heaped up,\r\nbut were never before united.  Yet in this day which had come to\r\nBengal, even this collection of looseness had taken shape, and\r\nproclaimed in a thundering voice, at our very door: \"Here I am.\"\r\n\r\nHow could we help thinking that it was all supernatural?  This\r\nmoment of our history seemed to have dropped into our hand like a\r\njewel from the crown of some drunken god.  It had no resemblance\r\nto our past; and so we were led to hope that all our wants and\r\nmiseries would disappear by the spell of some magic charm, that\r\nfor us there was no longer any boundary line between the possible\r\nand the impossible.  Everything seemed to be saying to us: \"It is\r\ncoming; it has come!\"\r\n\r\nThus we came to cherish the belief that our history needed no\r\nsteed, but that like heaven's chariot it would move with its own\r\ninherent power--At least no wages would have to be paid to the\r\ncharioteer; only his wine cup would have to be filled again and\r\nagain.  And then in some impossible paradise the goal of our\r\nhopes would be reached.\r\n\r\nMy husband was not altogether unmoved, but through all our\r\nexcitement it was the strain of sadness in him which deepened and\r\ndeepened.  He seemed to have a vision of something beyond the\r\nsurging present.\r\n\r\nI remember one day, in the course of the arguments he continually\r\nhad with Sandip, he said: \"Good fortune comes to our gate and\r\nannounces itself, only to prove that we have not the power to\r\nreceive it--that we have not kept things ready to be able to\r\ninvite it into our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was Sandip's answer.  \"You talk like an atheist because you\r\ndo not believe in our gods.  To us it has been made quite visible\r\nthat the Goddess has come with her boon, yet you distrust the\r\nobvious signs of her presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because I strongly believe in my God,\" said my husband,\r\n\"that I feel so certain that our preparations for his worship are\r\nlacking.  God has power to give the boon, but we must have power\r\nto accept it.\"\r\n\r\nThis kind of talk from my husband would only annoy me.  I could\r\nnot keep from joining in: \"You think this excitement is only a\r\nfire of drunkenness, but does not drunkenness, up to a point,\r\ngive strength?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" my husband replied.  \"It may give strength, but not\r\nweapons.\"\r\n\r\n\"But strength is the gift of God,\" I went on.  \"Weapons can be\r\nsupplied by mere mechanics.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband smiled.  \"The mechanics will claim their wages before\r\nthey deliver their supplies,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSandip swelled his chest as he retorted: \"Don't you trouble about\r\nthat.  Their wages shall be paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall bespeak the festive music when the payment has been\r\nmade, not before,\" my husband answered.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't imagine that we are depending on your bounty for the\r\nmusic,\" said Sandip scornfully.  \"Our festival is above all money\r\npayments.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his thick voice he began to sing:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"My lover of the unpriced love, spurning payments,\r\n  Plays upon the simple pipe, bought for nothing,\r\n  Drawing my heart away.\"\r\n*/\r\n\r\nThen with a smile he turned to me and said: \"If I sing, Queen\r\nBee, it is only to prove that when music comes into one's life,\r\nthe lack of a good voice is no matter.  When we sing merely on\r\nthe strength of our tunefulness, the song is belittled.  Now that\r\na full flood of music has swept over our country, let Nikhil\r\npractise his scales, while we rouse the land with our cracked\r\nvoices:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"My house cries to me: Why go out to lose your all?\r\n  My life says: All that you have, fling to the winds!\r\n  If we must lose our all, let us lose it: what is it worth after\r\n    all?\r\n  If I must court ruin, let me do it smilingly;\r\n  For my quest is the death-draught of immortality.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, Nikhil, that we have all lost our hearts.  None\r\ncan hold us any longer within the bounds of the easily possible,\r\nin our forward rush to the hopelessly impossible.\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"Those who would draw us back,\r\n  They know not the fearful joy of recklessness.\r\n  They know not that we have had our call\r\n  From the end of the crooked path.\r\n  All that is good and straight and trim--\r\n  Let it topple over in the dust.\"\r\n*/\r\n\r\nI thought that my husband was going to continue the discussion,\r\nbut he rose silently from his seat and left us.\r\n\r\nThe thing that was agitating me within was merely a variation of\r\nthe stormy passion outside, which swept the country from one end\r\nto the other.  The car of the wielder of my destiny was fast\r\napproaching, and the sound of its wheels reverberated in my\r\nbeing.  I had a constant feeling that something extraordinary\r\nmight happen any moment, for which, however, the responsibility\r\nwould not be mine.  Was I not removed from the plane in which\r\nright and wrong, and the feelings of others, have to be\r\nconsidered?  Had I ever wanted this--had I ever been waiting or\r\nhoping for any such thing?  Look at my whole life and tell me\r\nthen, if I was in any way accountable.\r\n\r\nThrough all my past I had been consistent in my devotion--but\r\nwhen at length it came to receiving the boon, a different god\r\nappeared!  And just as the awakened country, with its __Bande\r\nMataram__, thrills in salutation to the unrealized future\r\nbefore it, so do all my veins and nerves send forth shocks of\r\nwelcome to the unthought-of, the unknown, the importunate\r\nStranger.\r\n\r\nOne night I left my bed and slipped out of my room on to the open\r\nterrace.  Beyond our garden wall are fields of ripening rice.\r\nThrough the gaps in the village groves to the North, glimpses of\r\nthe river are seen.  The whole scene slept in the darkness like\r\nthe vague embryo of some future creation.\r\n\r\nIn that future I saw my country, a woman like myself, standing\r\nexpectant.  She has been drawn forth from her home corner by the\r\nsudden call of some Unknown.  She has had no time to pause or\r\nponder, or to light herself a torch, as she rushes forward into\r\nthe darkness ahead.  I know well how her very soul responds to\r\nthe distant flute-strains which call her; how her breast rises\r\nand falls; how she feels she nears it, nay it is already hers, so\r\nthat it matters not even if she run blindfold.  She is no mother.\r\nThere is no call to her of children in their hunger, no home to\r\nbe lighted of an evening, no household work to be done.  So; she\r\nhies to her tryst, for this is the land of the Vaishnava Poets.\r\nShe has left home, forgotten domestic duties; she has nothing but\r\nan unfathomable yearning which hurries her on--by what road, to\r\nwhat goal, she recks not.\r\n\r\nI, also, am possessed of just such a yearning.  I likewise have\r\nlost my home and also lost my way.  Both the end and the means\r\nhave become equally shadowy to me.  There remain only the\r\nyearning and the hurrying on.  Ah!  wretched wanderer through the\r\nnight, when the dawn reddens you will see no trace of a way to\r\nreturn.  But why return?  Death will serve as well.  If the Dark\r\nwhich sounded the flute should lead to destruction, why trouble\r\nabout the hereafter?  When I am merged in its blackness, neither\r\nI, nor good and bad, nor laughter, nor tears, shall be any more!\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n18. The condition of the curse which had reduced them to ashes\r\nwas such that they could only be restored to life if the stream\r\nof the Ganges was brought down to them.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Bengal the machinery of time being thus suddenly run at full\r\npressure, things which were difficult became easy, one following\r\nsoon after another.  Nothing could be held back any more, even in\r\nour corner of the country.  In the beginning our district was\r\nbackward, for my husband was unwilling to put any compulsion on\r\nthe villagers.  \"Those who make sacrifices for their country's\r\nsake are indeed her servants,\" he would say, \"but those who\r\ncompel others to make them in her name are her enemies.  They\r\nwould cut freedom at the root, to gain it at the top.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Sandip came and settled here, and his followers began to\r\nmove about the country, speaking in towns and market-places,\r\nwaves of excitement came rolling up to us as well.  A band of\r\nyoung fellows of the locality attached themselves to him, some\r\neven who had been known as a disgrace to the village.  But the\r\nglow of their genuine enthusiasm lighted them up, within as well\r\nas without.  It became quite clear that when the pure breezes of\r\na great joy and hope sweep through the land, all dirt and decay\r\nare cleansed away.  It is hard, indeed, for men to be frank and\r\nstraight and healthy, when their country is in the throes of\r\ndejection.\r\n\r\nThen were all eyes turned on my husband, from whose estates alone\r\nforeign sugar and salt and cloths had not been banished.  Even\r\nthe estate officers began to feel awkward and ashamed over it.\r\nAnd yet, some time ago, when my husband began to import country-\r\nmade articles into our village, he had been secretly and openly\r\ntwitted for his folly, by old and young alike.  When\r\n__Swadeshi__ had not yet become a boast, we had despised it\r\nwith all our hearts.\r\n\r\nMy husband still sharpens his Indian-made pencils with his\r\nIndian-made knife, does his writing with reed pens, drinks his\r\nwater out of a bell-metal vessel, and works at night in the light\r\nof an old-fashioned castor-oil lamp.  But this dull, milk-and-\r\nwater __Swadeshi__ of his never appealed to us.  Rather, we\r\nhad always felt ashamed of the inelegant, unfashionable furniture\r\nof his reception-rooms, especially when he had the magistrate, or\r\nany other European, as his guest.\r\n\r\nMy husband used to make light of my protests.  \"Why allow such\r\ntrifles to upset you?\"  he would say with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"They will think us barbarians, or at all events wanting in\r\nrefinement.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they do, I will pay them back by thinking that their\r\nrefinement does not go deeper than their white skins.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband had an ordinary brass pot on his writing-table which\r\nhe used as a flower-vase.  It has often happened that, when I had\r\nnews of some European guest, I would steal into his room and put\r\nin its place a crystal vase of European make.  \"Look here,\r\nBimala,\" he objected at length, \"that brass pot is as unconscious\r\nof itself as those blossoms are; but this thing protests its\r\npurpose so loudly, it is only fit for artificial flowers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bara Rani, alone, pandered to my husband's whims.  Once she\r\ncomes panting to say: \"Oh, brother, have you heard?  Such lovely\r\nIndian soaps have come out!  My days of luxury are gone by;\r\nstill, if they contain no animal fat, I should like to try some.\"\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing makes my husband beam all over, and the house\r\nis deluged with Indian scents and soaps.  Soaps indeed!  They are\r\nmore like lumps of caustic soda.  And do I not know that what my\r\nsister-in-law uses on herself are the European soaps of old,\r\nwhile these are made over to the maids for washing clothes?\r\n\r\nAnother time it is: \"Oh, brother dear, do get me some of these\r\nnew Indian pen-holders.\"\r\n\r\nHer \"brother\" bubbles up as usual, and the Bara Rani's room\r\nbecomes littered with all kinds of awful sticks that go by the\r\nname of __Swadeshi__ pen-holders.  Not that it makes any\r\ndifference to her, for reading and writing are out of her line.\r\nStill, in her writing-case, lies the selfsame ivory pen-holder,\r\nthe only one ever handled.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, all this was intended as a hit at me, because I\r\nwould not keep my husband company in his vagaries.  It was no\r\ngood trying to show up my sister-in-law's insincerity; my\r\nhusband's face would set so hard, if I barely touched on it.  One\r\nonly gets into trouble, trying to save such people from being\r\nimposed upon!\r\n\r\nThe Bara Rani loves sewing.  One day I could not help blurting\r\nout: \"What a humbug you are, sister!  When your 'brother' is\r\npresent, your mouth waters at the very mention of __Swadeshi__\r\nscissors, but it is the English-made article every time when you\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"What harm?\"  she replied.  \"Do you not see what pleasure it\r\ngives him?  We have grown up together in this house, since he was\r\na boy.  I simply cannot bear, as you can, the sight of the smile\r\nleaving his face.  Poor dear, he has no amusement except this\r\nplaying at shop-keeping.  You are his only dissipation, and you\r\nwill yet be his ruin!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you may say, it is not right to be double-faced,\" I\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law laughed out in my face.  \"Oh, our artless little\r\nChota Rani!--straight as a schoolmaster's rod, eh?  But a woman\r\nis not built that way.  She is soft and supple, so that she may\r\nbend without being crooked.\"\r\n\r\nI could not forget those words: \"You are his dissipation, and\r\nwill be his ruin!\"  Today I feel--if a man needs must have some\r\nintoxicant, let it not be a woman.\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuksar, within our estates, is one of the biggest trade centres\r\nin the district.  On one side of a stretch of water there is held\r\na daily bazar; on the other, a weekly market.  During the rains\r\nwhen this piece of water gets connected with the river, and boats\r\ncan come through, great quantities of cotton yarns, and woollen\r\nstuffs for the coming winter, are brought in for sale.\r\n\r\nAt the height of our enthusiasm, Sandip laid it down that all\r\nforeign articles, together with the demon of foreign influence,\r\nmust be driven out of our territory.\r\n\r\n\"Of course!\"  said I, girding myself up for a fight.\r\n\r\n\"I have had words with Nikhil about it,\" said Sandip.  \"He tells\r\nme, he does not mind speechifying, but he will not have\r\ncoercion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will see to that,\" I said, with a proud sense of power.  I\r\nknew how deep was my husband's love for me.  Had I been in my\r\nsenses I should have allowed myself to be torn to pieces rather\r\nthan assert my claim to that, at such a time.  But Sandip had to\r\nbe impressed with the full strength of my __Shakti__.\r\n\r\nSandip had brought home to me, in his irresistible way, how the\r\ncosmic Energy was revealed for each individual in the shape of\r\nsome special affinity.  Vaishnava Philosophy, he said, speaks of\r\nthe __Shakti__ of Delight that dwells in the heart of\r\ncreation, ever attracting the heart of her Eternal Lover.  Men\r\nhave a perpetual longing to bring out this __Shakti__ from the\r\nhidden depths of their own nature, and those of us who succeed in\r\ndoing so at once clearly understand the meaning of the music\r\ncoming to us from the Dark.  He broke out singing:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"My flute, that was busy with its song,\r\n  Is silent now when we stand face to face.\r\n  My call went seeking you from sky to sky\r\n    When you lay hidden;\r\n  But now all my cry finds its smile\r\n    In the face of my beloved.\"\r\n*/\r\n\r\nListening to his allegories, I had forgotten that I was plain and\r\nsimple Bimala.  I was __Shakti__; also an embodiment of\r\nUniversal joy.  Nothing could fetter me, nothing was impossible\r\nfor me; whatever I touched would gain new life.  The world around\r\nme was a fresh creation of mine; for behold, before my heart's\r\nresponse had touched it, there had not been this wealth of gold\r\nin the Autumn sky!  And this hero, this true servant of the\r\ncountry, this devotee of mine--this flaming intelligence, this\r\nburning energy, this shining genius--him also was I creating from\r\nmoment to moment.  Have I not seen how my presence pours fresh\r\nlife into him time after time?\r\n\r\nThe other day Sandip begged me to receive a young lad, Amulya, an\r\nardent disciple of his.  In a moment I could see a new light\r\nflash out from the boy's eyes, and knew that he, too, had a\r\nvision of __Shakti__ manifest, that my creative force had\r\nbegun its work in his blood.  \"What sorcery is this of yours!\"\r\nexclaimed Sandip next day.  \"Amulya is a boy no longer, the wick\r\nof his life is all ablaze.  Who can hide your fire under your\r\nhome-roof?  Every one of them must be touched up by it, sooner or\r\nlater, and when every lamp is alight what a grand carnival of a\r\n__Dewali__ we shall have in the country!\"\r\n\r\nBlinded with the brilliance of my own glory I had decided to\r\ngrant my devotee this boon.  I was overweeningly confident that\r\nnone could baulk me of what I really wanted.  When I returned to\r\nmy room after my talk with Sandip, I loosed my hair and tied it\r\nup over again.  Miss Gilby had taught me a way of brushing it up\r\nfrom the neck and piling it in a knot over my head.  This style\r\nwas a favourite one with my husband.  \"It is a pity,\" he once\r\nsaid, \"that Providence should have chosen poor me, instead of\r\npoet Kalidas, for revealing all the wonders of a woman's neck.\r\nThe poet would probably have likened it to a flower-stem; but I\r\nfeel it to be a torch, holding aloft the black flame of your\r\nhair.\"  With which he ...  but why, oh why, do I go back to all\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nI sent for my husband.  In the old days I could contrive a\r\nhundred and one excuses, good or bad, to get him to come to me.\r\nNow that all this had stopped for days I had lost the art of\r\ncontriving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanchu's wife has just died of a lingering consumption.  Panchu\r\nmust undergo a purification ceremony to cleanse himself of sin\r\nand to propitiate his community.  The community has calculated\r\nand informed him that it will cost one hundred and twenty-three\r\nrupees.\r\n\r\n\"How absurd!\"  I cried, highly indignant.  \"Don't submit to this,\r\nPanchu.  What can they do to you?\"\r\n\r\nRaising to me his patient eyes like those of a tired-out beast of\r\nburden, he said: \"There is my eldest girl, sir, she will have to\r\nbe married.  And my poor wife's last rites have to be put\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if the sin were yours, Panchu,\" I mused aloud, \"you have\r\nsurely suffered enough for it already.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so, sir,\" he naïvely assented.  \"I had to sell part of\r\nmy land and mortgage the rest to meet the doctor's bills.  But\r\nthere is no escape from the offerings I have to make the\r\nBrahmins.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the use of arguing?  When will come the time, I\r\nwondered, for the purification of the Brahmins themselves who can\r\naccept such offerings?\r\n\r\nAfter his wife's illness and funeral, Panchu, who had been\r\ntottering on the brink of starvation, went altogether beyond his\r\ndepth.  In a desperate attempt to gain consolation of some sort\r\nhe took to sitting at the feet of a wandering ascetic, and\r\nsucceeded in acquiring philosophy enough to forget that his\r\nchildren went hungry.  He kept himself steeped for a time in the\r\nidea that the world is vanity, and if of pleasure it has none,\r\npain also is a delusion.  Then, at last, one night he left his\r\nlittle ones in their tumble-down hovel, and started off wandering\r\non his own account.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing of this at the time, for just then a veritable\r\nocean-churning by gods and demons was going on in my mind.  Nor\r\ndid my master tell me that he had taken Panchu's deserted\r\nchildren under his own roof and was caring for them, though alone\r\nin the house, with his school to attend to the whole day.\r\n\r\nAfter a month Panchu came back, his ascetic fervour considerably\r\nworn off.  His eldest boy and girl nestled up to him, crying:\r\n\"Where have you been all this time, father?\"  His youngest boy\r\nfilled his lap; his second girl leant over his back with her arms\r\naround his neck; and they all wept together.  \"O sir!\"  sobbed\r\nPanchu, at length, to my master.  \"I have not the power to give\r\nthese little ones enough to eat--I am not free to run away from\r\nthem.  What has been my sin that I should be scourged so, bound\r\nhand and foot?\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the thread of Panchu's little trade connections\r\nhad snapped and he found he could not resume them.  He clung on\r\nto the shelter of my master's roof, which had first received him\r\non his return, and said not a word of going back home.  \"Look\r\nhere, Panchu,\" my master was at last driven to say.  \"If you\r\ndon't take care of your cottage, it will tumble down altogether.\r\nI will lend you some money with which you can do a bit of\r\npeddling and return it me little by little.\"\r\n\r\nPanchu was not excessively pleased--was there then no such thing\r\nas charity on earth?  And when my master asked him to write out a\r\nreceipt for the money, he felt that this favour, demanding a\r\nreturn, was hardly worth having.  My master, however, did not\r\ncare to make an outward gift which would leave an inward\r\nobligation.  To destroy self-respect is to destroy caste, was his\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nAfter signing the note, Panchu's obeisance to my master fell off\r\nconsiderably in its reverence--the dust-taking was left out.  It\r\nmade my master smile; he asked nothing better than that courtesy\r\nshould stoop less low.  \"Respect given and taken truly balances\r\nthe account between man and man,\" was the way he put it, \"but\r\nveneration is overpayment.\"\r\n\r\nPanchu began to buy cloth at the market and peddle it about the\r\nvillage.  He did not get much of cash payment, it is true, but\r\nwhat he could realize in kind, in the way of rice, jute, and\r\nother field produce, went towards settlement of his account.  In\r\ntwo month's time he was able to pay back an instalment of my\r\nmaster's debt, and with it there was a corresponding reduction in\r\nthe depth of his bow.  He must have begun to feel that he had\r\nbeen revering as a saint a mere man, who had not even risen\r\nsuperior to the lure of lucre.\r\n\r\nWhile Panchu was thus engaged, the full shock of the\r\n__Swadeshi__ flood fell on him.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was vacation time, and many youths of our village and its\r\nneighbourhood had come home from their schools and colleges.\r\nThey attached themselves to Sandip's leadership with enthusiasm,\r\nand some, in their excess of zeal, gave up their studies\r\naltogether.  Many of the boys had been free pupils of my school\r\nhere, and some held college scholarships from me in Calcutta.\r\nThey came up in a body, and demanded that I should banish foreign\r\ngoods from my Suksar market.\r\n\r\nI told them I could not do it.\r\n\r\nThey were sarcastic: \"Why, Maharaja, will the loss be too much\r\nfor you?\"\r\n\r\nI took no notice of the insult in their tone, and was about to\r\nreply that the loss would fall on the poor traders and their\r\ncustomers, not on me, when my master, who was present,\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the loss will be his--not yours, that is clear enough,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"But for one's country .  .\"\r\n\r\n\"The country does not mean the soil, but the men on it,\"\r\ninterrupted my master again.  \"Have you yet wasted so much as a\r\nglance on what was happening to them?  But now you would dictate\r\nwhat salt they shall eat, what clothes they shall wear.  Why\r\nshould they put up with such tyranny, and why should we let\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have taken to Indian salt and sugar and cloth ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may do as you please to work off your irritation, to keep up\r\nyour fanaticism.  You are well off, you need not mind the cost.\r\nThe poor do not want to stand in your way, but you insist on\r\ntheir submitting to your compulsion.  As it is, every moment of\r\ntheirs is a life-and-death struggle for a bare living; you cannot\r\neven imagine the difference a few pice means to them--so little\r\nhave you in common.  You have spent your whole past in a superior\r\ncompartment, and now you come down to use them as tools for the\r\nwreaking of your wrath.  I call it cowardly.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all old pupils of my master, so they did not venture to\r\nbe disrespectful, though they were quivering with indignation.\r\nThey turned to me.  \"Will you then be the only one, Maharaja, to\r\nput obstacles in the way of what the country would achieve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who am I, that I should dare do such a thing?  Would I not\r\nrather lay down my life to help it?\"\r\n\r\nThe M.A.  student smiled a crooked smile, as he asked: \"May we\r\nenquire what you are actually doing to help?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have imported Indian mill-made yarn and kept it for sale in my\r\nSuksar market, and also sent bales of it to markets belonging to\r\nneighbouring __zamindars__.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have been to your market, Maharaja,\" the same student\r\nexclaimed, \"and found nobody buying this yarn.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is neither my fault nor the fault of my market.  It only\r\nshows the whole country has not taken your vow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not all,\" my master went on.  \"It shows that what you\r\nhave pledged yourselves to do is only to pester others.  You want\r\ndealers, who have not taken your vow, to buy that yarn; weavers,\r\nwho have not taken your vow, to make it up; then their wares\r\neventually to be foisted on to consumers who, also, have not\r\ntaken your vow.  The method?  Your clamour, and the\r\n__zamindars'__ oppression.  The result: all righteousness\r\nyours, all privations theirs!\"\r\n\r\n\"And may we venture to ask, further, what your share of the\r\nprivation has been?\"  pursued a science student.\r\n\r\n\"You want to know, do you?\"  replied my master.  \"It is Nikhil\r\nhimself who has to buy up that Indian mill yarn; he has had to\r\nstart a weaving school to get it woven; and to judge by his past\r\nbrilliant business exploits, by the time his cotton fabrics leave\r\nthe loom their cost will be that of cloth-of-gold; so they will\r\nonly find a use, perhaps, as curtains for his drawing-room, even\r\nthough their flimsiness may fail to screen him.  When you get\r\ntired of your vow, you will laugh the loudest at their artistic\r\neffect.  And if their workmanship is ever truly appreciated at\r\nall, it will be by foreigners.\"\r\n\r\nI have known my master all my life, but have never seen him so\r\nagitated.  I could see that the pain had been silently\r\naccumulating in his heart for some time, because of his\r\nsurpassing love for me, and that his habitual self-possession had\r\nbecome secretly undermined to the breaking point.\r\n\r\n\"You are our elders,\" said the medical student.  \"It is unseemly\r\nthat we should bandy words with you.  But tell us, pray, finally,\r\nare you determined not to oust foreign articles from your\r\nmarket?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not,\" I said, \"because they are not mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that will cause you a loss!\"  smiled the M.A.  student.\r\n\r\n\"Because he, whose is the loss, is the best judge,\" retorted my\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nWith a shout of __Bande Mataram__ they left us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Six\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW days later, my master brought Panchu round to me.  His\r\n__zamindar__, it appeared, had fined him a hundred rupees, and\r\nwas threatening him with ejectment.\r\n\r\n\"For what fault?\"  I enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" I was told, \"he has been found selling foreign cloths.\r\nHe begged and prayed Harish Kundu, his __zamindar__, to let\r\nhim sell off his stock, bought with borrowed money, promising\r\nfaithfully never to do it again; but the __zamindar__ would\r\nnot hear of it, and insisted on his burning the foreign stuff\r\nthere and then, if he wanted to be let off.  Panchu in his\r\ndesperation blurted out defiantly: \"I can't afford it!  You are\r\nrich; why not buy it up and burn it?\"  This only made Harish\r\nKundu red in the face as he shouted: \"The scoundrel must be\r\ntaught manners, give him a shoe-beating!\"  So poor Panchu got\r\ninsulted as well as fined.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to the cloth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole bale was burnt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who else was there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any number of people, who all kept shouting __Bande\r\nMataram__.  Sandip was also there.  He took up some of the\r\nashes, crying: 'Brothers!  This is the first funeral pyre lighted\r\nby your village in celebration of the last rites of foreign\r\ncommerce.  These are sacred ashes.  Smear yourselves with them in\r\ntoken of your __Swadeshi__ vow.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Panchu,\" said I, turning to him, \"you must lodge a complaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one will bear me witness,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"None bear witness?--Sandip!  Sandip!\"\r\n\r\nSandip came out of his room at my call.  \"What is the matter?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you bear witness to the burning of this man's cloth?\"\r\n\r\nSandip smiled.  \"Of course I shall be a witness in the case,\" he\r\nsaid.  \"But I shall be on the opposite side.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean,\" I exclaimed, \"by being a witness on this or\r\nthat side?  Will you not bear witness to the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the thing which happens the only truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"What other truths can there be?\"\r\n\r\n\"The things that ought to happen!  The truth we must build up\r\nwill require a great deal of untruth in the process.  Those who\r\nhave made their way in the world have created truth, not blindly\r\nfollowed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so--\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I will bear what you people are pleased to call false\r\nwitness, as they have done who have created empires, built up\r\nsocial systems, founded religious organizations.  Those who would\r\nrule do not dread untruths; the shackles of truth are reserved\r\nfor those who will fall under their sway.  Have you not read\r\nhistory?  Do you not know that in the immense cauldrons, where\r\nvast political developments are simmering, untruths are the main\r\ningredients?\"\r\n\r\n\"Political cookery on a large scale is doubtless going on, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know!  You, of course, will never do any of the cooking.\r\nYou prefer to be one of those down whose throats the hotchpotch\r\nwhich is being cooked will be crammed.  They will partition\r\nBengal and say it is for your benefit.  They will seal the doors\r\nof education and call it raising the standard.  But you will\r\nalways remain good boys, snivelling in your corners.  We bad men,\r\nhowever, must see whether we cannot erect a defensive\r\nfortification of untruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no use arguing about these things, Nikhil,\" my master\r\ninterposed.  \"How can they who do not feel the truth within them,\r\nrealize that to bring it out from its obscurity into the light is\r\nman's highest aim--not to keep on heaping material outside?\"\r\n\r\nSandip laughed.  \"Right, sir!\"  said he.  \"Quite a correct speech\r\nfor a schoolmaster.  That is the kind of stuff I have read in\r\nbooks; but in the real world I have seen that man's chief\r\nbusiness is the accumulation of outside material.  Those who are\r\nmasters in the art, advertise the biggest lies in their business,\r\nenter false accounts in their political ledgers with their\r\nbroadest-pointed pens, launch their newspapers daily laden with\r\nuntruths, and send preachers abroad to disseminate falsehood like\r\nflies carrying pestilential germs.  I am a humble follower of\r\nthese great ones.  When I was attached to the Congress party I\r\nnever hesitated to dilute ten per cent of truth with ninety per\r\ncent of untruth.  And now, merely because I have ceased to belong\r\nto that party, I have not forgotten the basic fact that man's\r\ngoal is not truth but success.\"\r\n\r\n\"True success,\" corrected my master.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" replied Sandip, \"but the fruit of true success ripens\r\nonly by cultivating the field of untruth, after tearing up the\r\nsoil and pounding it into dust.  Truth grows up by itself like\r\nweeds and thorns, and only worms can expect to get fruit from\r\nit!\"  With this he flung out of the room.\r\n\r\nMy master smiled as he looked towards me.  \"Do you know, Nikhil,\"\r\nhe said, \"I believe Sandip is not irreligious--his religion is of\r\nthe obverse side of truth, like the dark moon, which is still a\r\nmoon, for all that its light has gone over to the wrong side.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is why,\" I assented, \"I have always had an affection for\r\nhim, though we have never been able to agree.  I cannot contemn\r\nhim, even now; though he has hurt me sorely, and may yet hurt me\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have begun to realize that,\" said my master.  \"I have long\r\nwondered how you could go on putting up with him.  I have, at\r\ntimes, even suspected you of weakness.  I now see that though you\r\ntwo do not rhyme, your rhythm is the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fate seems bent on writing __Paradise Lost__ in blank verse,\r\nin my case, and so has no use for a rhyming friend!\"  I remarked,\r\npursuing his conceit.\r\n\r\n\"But what of Panchu?\"  resumed my master.\r\n\r\n\"You say Harish Kundu wants to eject him from his ancestral\r\nholding.  Supposing I buy it up and then keep him on as my\r\ntenant?\"\r\n\r\n\"And his fine?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can the __zamindar__ realize that if he becomes my\r\ntenant?\"\r\n\r\n\"His burnt bale of cloth?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will procure him another.  I should like to see anyone\r\ninterfering with a tenant of mine, for trading as he pleases!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, sir,\" interposed Panchu despondently, \"while you\r\nbig folk are doing the fighting, the police and the law vultures\r\nwill merrily gather round, and the crowd will enjoy the fun, but\r\nwhen it comes to getting killed, it will be the turn of only poor\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what harm can come to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will burn down my house, sir, children and all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will take charge of your children,\" said my master.\r\n\"You may go on with any trade you like.  They shan't touch you.\"\r\n\r\nThat very day I bought up Panchu's holding and entered into\r\nformal possession.  Then the trouble began.\r\n\r\nPanchu had inherited the holding of his grandfather as his sole\r\nsurviving heir.  Everybody knew this.  But at this juncture an\r\naunt turned up from somewhere, with her boxes and bundles, her\r\nrosary, and a widowed niece.  She ensconced herself in Panchu's\r\nhome and laid claim to a life interest in all he had.\r\n\r\nPanchu was dumbfounded.  \"My aunt died long ago,\" he protested.\r\n\r\nIn reply he was told that he was thinking of his uncle's first\r\nwife, but that the former had lost no time in taking to himself a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\"But my uncle died before my aunt,\" exclaimed Panchu, still more\r\nmystified.  \"Where was the time for him to marry again?\"\r\n\r\nThis was not denied.  But Panchu was reminded that it had never\r\nbeen asserted that the second wife had come after the death of\r\nthe first, but the former had been married by his uncle during\r\nthe latter's lifetime.  Not relishing the idea of living with a\r\nco-wife she had remained in her father's house till her husband's\r\ndeath, after which she had got religion and retired to holy\r\nBrindaban, whence she was now coming.  These facts were well\r\nknown to the officers of Harish Kundu, as well as to some of his\r\ntenants.  And if the __zamindar's__ summons should be\r\nperemptory enough, even some of those who had partaken of the\r\nmarriage feast would be forthcoming!\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when I happened to be specially busy, word came to\r\nmy office room that Bimala had sent for me.  I was startled.\r\n\r\n\"Who did you say had sent for me?\"  I asked the messenger.\r\n\r\n\"The Rani Mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bara Rani?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, the Chota Rani Mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chota Rani!  It seemed a century since I had been sent for by\r\nher.  I kept them all waiting there, and went off into the inner\r\napartments.  When I stepped into our room I had another shock of\r\nsurprise to find Bimala there with a distinct suggestion of being\r\ndressed up.  The room, which from persistent neglect had latterly\r\nacquired an air of having grown absent-minded, had regained\r\nsomething of its old order this afternoon.  I stood there\r\nsilently, looking enquiringly at Bimala.\r\n\r\nShe flushed a little and the fingers of her right hand toyed for\r\na time with the bangles on her left arm.  Then she abruptly broke\r\nthe silence.  \"Look here!  Is it right that ours should be the\r\nonly market in all Bengal which allows foreign goods?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, would be the right thing to do?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Order them to be cleared out!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the goods are not mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not the market yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is much more theirs who use it for trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them trade in Indian goods, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing would please me better.  But suppose they do not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!  How dare they be so insolent?  Are you not ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very busy this afternoon and cannot stop to argue it out.\r\nBut I must refuse to tyrannize.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would not be tyranny for selfish gain, but for the sake of\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tyrannize for the country is to tyrannize over the country.\r\nBut that I am afraid you will never understand.\"  With this I\r\ncame away.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden the world shone out for me with a fresh\r\nclearness.  I seemed to feel it in my blood, that the Earth had\r\nlost the weight of its earthiness, and its daily task of\r\nsustaining life no longer appeared a burden, as with a wonderful\r\naccess of power it whirled through space telling its beads of\r\ndays and nights.  What endless work, and withal what illimitable\r\nenergy of freedom!  None shall check it, oh, none can ever check\r\nit!  From the depths of my being an uprush of joy, like a\r\nwaterspout, sprang high to storm the skies.\r\n\r\nI repeatedly asked myself the meaning of this outburst of\r\nfeeling.  At first there was no intelligible answer.  Then it\r\nbecame clear that the bond against which I had been fretting\r\ninwardly, night and day, had broken.  To my surprise I discovered\r\nthat my mind was freed from all mistiness.  I could see\r\neverything relating to Bimala as if vividly pictured on a camera\r\nscreen.  It was palpable that she had specially dressed herself\r\nup to coax that order out of me.  Till that moment, I had never\r\nviewed Bimala's adornment as a thing apart from herself.  But\r\ntoday the elaborate manner in which she had done up her hair, in\r\nthe English fashion, made it appear a mere decoration.  That\r\nwhich before had the mystery of her personality about it, and was\r\npriceless to me, was now out to sell itself cheap.\r\n\r\nAs I came away from that broken cage of a bedroom, out into the\r\ngolden sunlight of the open, there was the avenue of bauhinias,\r\nalong the gravelled path in front of my verandah, suffusing the\r\nsky with a rosy flush.  A group of starlings beneath the trees\r\nwere noisily chattering away.  In the distance an empty bullock\r\ncart, with its nose on the ground, held up its tail aloft--one of\r\nits unharnessed bullocks grazing, the other resting on the grass,\r\nits eyes dropping for very comfort, while a crow on its back was\r\npecking away at the insects on its body.\r\n\r\nI seemed to have come closer to the heartbeats of the great earth\r\nin all the simplicity of its daily life; its warm breath fell on\r\nme with the perfume of the bauhinia blossoms; and an anthem,\r\ninexpressibly sweet, seemed to peal forth from this world, where\r\nI, in my freedom, live in the freedom of all else.\r\n\r\nWe, men, are knights whose quest is that freedom to which our\r\nideals call us.  She who makes for us the banner under which we\r\nfare forth is the true Woman for us.  We must tear away the\r\ndisguise of her who weaves our net of enchantment at home, and\r\nknow her for what she is.  We must beware of clothing her in the\r\nwitchery of our own longings and imaginings, and thus allow her\r\nto distract us from our true quest.\r\n\r\nToday I feel that I shall win through.  I have come to the\r\ngateway of the simple; I am now content to see things as they\r\nare.  I have gained freedom myself; I shall allow freedom to\r\nothers.  In my work will be my salvation.\r\n\r\nI know that, time and again, my heart will ache, but now that I\r\nunderstand its pain in all its truth, I can disregard it.  Now\r\nthat I know it concerns only me, what after all can be its value?\r\nThe suffering which belongs to all mankind shall be my crown.\r\n\r\nSave me, Truth!  Never again let me hanker after the false\r\nparadise of Illusion.  If I must walk alone, let me at least\r\ntread your path.  Let the drum-beats of Truth lead me to Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSandip's Story\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala sent for me that day, but for a time she could not utter a\r\nword; her eyes kept brimming up to the verge of overflowing.  I\r\ncould see at once that she had been unsuccessful with Nikhil.\r\nShe had been so proudly confident that she would have her own\r\nway--but I had never shared her confidence.  Woman knows man well\r\nenough where he is weak, but she is quite unable to fathom him\r\nwhere he is strong.  The fact is that man is as much a mystery to\r\nwoman as woman is to man.  If that were not so, the separation of\r\nthe sexes would only have been a waste of Nature's energy.\r\n\r\nAh pride, pride!  The trouble was, not that the necessary thing\r\nhad failed of accomplishment, but that the entreaty, which had\r\ncost her such a struggle to make, should have been refused.  What\r\na wealth of colour and movement, suggestion and deception, group\r\nthemselves round this \"me\" and \"mine\" in woman.  That is just\r\nwhere her beauty lies--she is ever so much more personal than\r\nman.  When man was being made, the Creator was a schoolmaster--\r\nHis bag full of commandments and principles; but when He came to\r\nwoman, He resigned His headmastership and turned artist, with\r\nonly His brush and paint-box.\r\n\r\nWhen Bimala stood silently there, flushed and tearful in her\r\nbroken pride, like a storm-cloud, laden with rain and charged\r\nwith lightning, lowering over the horizon, she looked so\r\nabsolutely sweet that I had to go right up to her and take her\r\nby the hand.  It was trembling, but she did not snatch it away.\r\n\r\n\"Bee,\" said I, \"we two are colleagues, for our aims are one.\r\nLet us sit down and talk it over.\"\r\n\r\nI led her, unresisting, to a seat.  But strange!  at that very\r\npoint the rush of my impetuosity suffered an unaccountable check\r\n--just as the current of the mighty Padma, roaring on in its\r\nirresistible course, all of a sudden gets turned away from the\r\nbank it is crumbling by some trifling obstacle beneath the\r\nsurface.  When I pressed Bimala's hand my nerves rang music, like\r\ntuned-up strings; but the symphony stopped short at the first\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nWhat stood in the way?  Nothing singly; it was a tangle of a\r\nmultitude of things--nothing definitely palpable, but only that\r\nunaccountable sense of obstruction.  Anyhow, this much has become\r\nplain to me, that I cannot swear to what I really am.  It is\r\nbecause I am such a mystery to my own mind that my attraction for\r\nmyself is so strong!  If once the whole of myself should become\r\nknown to me, I would then fling it all away--and reach beatitude!\r\n\r\nAs she sat down, Bimala went ashy pale.  She, too, must have\r\nrealized what a crisis had come and gone, leaving her unscathed.\r\nThe comet had passed by, but the brush of its burning tail had\r\novercome her.  To help her to recover herself I said: \"Obstacles\r\nthere will be, but let us fight them through, and not be down-\r\nhearted.  Is not that best, Queen?\"\r\n\r\nBimala cleared her throat with a little cough, but simply to\r\nmurmur: \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us sketch out our plan of action,\" I continued, as I drew a\r\npiece of paper and a pencil from my pocket.\r\n\r\nI began to make a list of the workers who had joined us from\r\nCalcutta and to assign their duties to each.  Bimala interrupted\r\nme before I was through, saying wearily: \"Leave it now; I will\r\njoin you again this evening\" and then she hurried out of the\r\nroom.  It was evident she was not in a state to attend to\r\nanything.  She must be alone with herself for a while--perhaps\r\nlie down on her bed and have a good cry!\r\n\r\nWhen she left me, my intoxication began to deepen, as the cloud\r\ncolours grow richer after the sun is down.  I felt I had let the\r\nmoment of moments slip by.  What an awful coward I had been!  She\r\nmust have left me in sheer disgust at my qualms--and she was\r\nright!\r\n\r\nWhile I was tingling all over with these reflections, a servant\r\ncame in and announced Amulya, one of our boys.  I felt like\r\nsending him away for the time, but he stepped in before I could\r\nmake up my mind.  Then we fell to discussing the news of the\r\nfights which were raging in different quarters over cloth and\r\nsugar and salt; and the air was soon clear of all fumes of\r\nintoxication.  I felt as if awakened from a dream.  I leapt to my\r\nfeet feeling quite ready for the fray--Bande Mataram!\r\n\r\nThe news was various.  Most of the traders who were tenants of\r\nHarish Kundu had come over to us.  Many of Nikhil's officials\r\nwere also secretly on our side, pulling the wires in our\r\ninterest.  The Marwari shopkeepers were offering to pay a\r\npenalty, if only allowed to clear their present stocks.  Only\r\nsome Mahomedan traders were still obdurate.\r\n\r\nOne of them was taking home some German-made shawls for his\r\nfamily.  These were confiscated and burnt by one of our village\r\nboys.  This had given rise to trouble.  We offered to buy him\r\nIndian woollen stuffs in their place.  But where were cheap\r\nIndian woollens to be had?  We could not very well indulge him in\r\nCashmere shawls!  He came and complained to Nikhil, who advised\r\nhim to go to law.  Of course Nikhil's men saw to it that the\r\ntrial should come to nothing, even his law-agent being on our\r\nside!\r\n\r\nThe point is, if we have to replace burnt foreign clothes with\r\nIndian cloth every time, and on the top of that fight through a\r\nlaw-suit, where is the money to come from?  And the beauty of it\r\nis that this destruction of foreign goods is increasing their\r\ndemand and sending up the foreigner's profits--very like what\r\nhappened to the fortunate shopkeeper whose chandeliers the nabob\r\ndelighted in smashing, tickled by the tinkle of the breaking\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe next problem is--since there is no such thing as cheap and\r\ngaudy Indian woollen stuff, should we be rigorous in our boycott\r\nof foreign flannels and memos, or make an exception in their\r\nfavour?\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\"  said I at length on the first point, \"we are not\r\ngoing to keep on making presents of Indian stuff to those who\r\nhave got their foreign purchases confiscated.  The penalty is\r\nintended to fall on them, not on us.  If they go to law, we must\r\nretaliate by burning down their granaries!--What startles you,\r\nAmulya?  It is not the prospect of a grand illumination that\r\ndelights me!  You must remember, this is War.  If you are afraid\r\nof causing suffering, go in for love-making, you will never do\r\nfor this work!\"\r\n\r\nThe second problem I solved by deciding to allow no compromise\r\nwith foreign articles, in any circumstance whatever.  In the good\r\nold days, when these gaily coloured foreign shawls were unknown,\r\nour peasantry used to manage well enough with plain cotton\r\nquilts--they must learn to do so again.  They may not look as\r\ngorgeous, but this is not the time to think of looks.\r\n\r\nMost of the boatmen had been won over to refuse to carry foreign\r\ngoods, but the chief of them, Mirjan, was still insubordinate.\r\n\r\n\"Could you not get his boat sunk?\"  I asked our manager here.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing easier, sir,\" he replied.  \"But what if afterwards I am\r\nheld responsible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why be so clumsy as to leave any loophole for responsibility?\r\nHowever, if there must be any, my shoulders will be there to bear\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nMirjan's boat was tied near the landing-place after its freight\r\nhad been taken over to the market-place.  There was no one on it,\r\nfor the manager had arranged for some entertainment to which all\r\nhad been invited.  After dusk the boat, loaded with rubbish, was\r\nholed and set adrift.  It sank in mid-stream.\r\n\r\nMirjan understood the whole thing.  He came to me in tears to beg\r\nfor mercy.  \"I was wrong, sir--\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you realize that all of a sudden?\"  I sneered.\r\n\r\nHe made no direct reply.  \"The boat was worth two thousand\r\nrupees,\" he said.  \"I now see my mistake, and if excused this\r\ntime I will never ...\"  with which he threw himself at my feet.\r\n\r\nI asked him to come ten days later.  If only we could pay him\r\nthat two thousand rupees at once, we could buy him up body and\r\nsoul.  This is just the sort of man who could render us immense\r\nservice, if won over.  We shall never be able to make any headway\r\nunless we can lay our hands on plenty of money.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bimala came into the sitting-room, in the evening, I\r\nsaid as I rose up to receive her: \"Queen!  Everything is ready,\r\nsuccess is at hand, but we must have money.\r\n\r\n\"Money?  How much money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very much, but by hook or by crook we must have it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how much?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mere fifty thousand rupees will do for the present.\"\r\n\r\nBimala blenched inwardly at the figure, but tried not to show it.\r\nHow could she again admit defeat?\r\n\r\n\"Queen!\"  said I, \"you only can make the impossible possible.\r\nIndeed you have already done so.  Oh, that I could show you the\r\nextent of your achievement--then you would know it.  But the time\r\nfor that is not now.  Now we want money!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI could see that the thought of selling her jewels had occurred\r\nto her.  So I said: \"Your jewels must remain in reserve.  One can\r\nnever tell when they may be wanted.\"  And then, as Bimala stared\r\nblankly at me in silence, I went on: \"This money must come from\r\nyour husband's treasury.\"\r\n\r\nBimala was still more taken aback.  After a long pause she said:\r\n\"But how am Ito get his money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not his money yours as well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no!\"  she said, her wounded pride hurt afresh.\r\n\r\n\"If not,\" I cried, \"neither is it his, but his country's, whom he\r\nhas deprived of it, in her time of need!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how am Ito get it?\"  she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Get it you shall and must.  You know best how.  You must get it\r\nfor Her to whom it rightfully belongs.  __Bande Mataram__!\r\nThese are the magic words which will open the door of his iron\r\nsafe, break through the walls of his strong-room, and confound\r\nthe hearts of those who are disloyal to its call.  Say __Bande\r\nMataram__, Bee!\"\r\n\r\n\"__Bande Mataram__!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Seven\r\n\r\nSandip's Story\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are men, we are kings, we must have our tribute.  Ever since\r\nwe have come upon the Earth we have been plundering her; and the\r\nmore we claimed, the more she submitted.  From primeval days have\r\nwe men been plucking fruits, cutting down trees, digging up the\r\nsoil, killing beast, bird and fish.  From the bottom of the sea,\r\nfrom underneath the ground, from the very jaws of death, it has\r\nall been grabbing and grabbing and grabbing--no strong-box in\r\nNature's store-room has been respected or left unrifled.  The one\r\ndelight of this Earth is to fulfil the claims of those who are\r\nmen.  She has been made fertile and beautiful and complete\r\nthrough her endless sacrifices to them.  But for this, she would\r\nbe lost in the wilderness, not knowing herself, the doors of her\r\nheart shut, her diamonds and pearls never seeing the light.\r\n\r\nLikewise, by sheer force of our claims, we men have opened up all\r\nthe latent possibilities of women.  In the process of\r\nsurrendering themselves to us, they have ever gained their true\r\ngreatness.  Because they had to bring all the diamonds of their\r\nhappiness and the pearls of their sorrow into our royal treasury,\r\nthey have found their true wealth.  So for men to accept is truly\r\nto give: for women to give is truly to gain.\r\n\r\nThe demand I have just made from Bimala, however, is indeed a\r\nlarge one!  At first I felt scruples; for is it not the habit of\r\nman's mind to be in purposeless conflict with itself?  I thought\r\nI had imposed too hard a task.  My first impulse was to call her\r\nback, and tell her I would rather not make her life wretched by\r\ndragging her into all these troubles.  I forgot, for the moment,\r\nthat it was the mission of man to be aggressive, to make woman's\r\nexistence fruitful by stirring up disquiet in the depth of her\r\npassivity, to make the whole world blessed by churning up the\r\nimmeasurable abyss of suffering!  This is why man's hands are so\r\nstrong, his grip so firm.  Bimala had been longing with all her\r\nheart that I, Sandip, should demand of her some great sacrifice--\r\nshould call her to her death.  How else could she be happy?  Had\r\nshe not waited all these weary years only for an opportunity to\r\nweep out her heart--so satiated was she with the monotony of her\r\nplacid happiness?  And therefore, at the very sight of me, her\r\nheart's horizon darkened with the rain clouds of her impending\r\ndays of anguish.  If I pity her and save her from her sorrows,\r\nwhat then was the purpose of my being born a man?\r\n\r\nThe real reason of my qualms is that my demand happens to be for\r\nmoney.  That savours of beggary, for money is man's, not woman's.\r\nThat is why I had to make it a big figure.  A thousand or two\r\nwould have the air of petty theft.  Fifty thousand has all the\r\nexpanse of romantic brigandage.  Ah, but riches should really\r\nhave been mine!  So many of my desires have had to halt, again\r\nand again, on the road to accomplishment simply for want of\r\nmoney.  This does not become me!  Had my fate been merely unjust,\r\nit could be forgiven--but its bad taste is unpardonable.  It is\r\nnot simply a hardship that a man like me should be at his wit's\r\nend to pay his house rent, or should have to carefully count out\r\nthe coins for an Intermediate Class railway ticket--it is vulgar!\r\n\r\nIt is equally clear that Nikhil's paternal estates are a\r\nsuperfluity to him.  For him it would not have been at all\r\nunbecoming to be poor.  He would have cheerfully pulled in the\r\ndouble harness of indigent mediocrity with that precious master\r\nof his.  I should love to have, just for once, the chance to\r\nfling about fifty thousand rupees in the service of my country\r\nand to the satisfaction of myself.  I am a nabob born, and it is\r\na great dream of mine to get rid of this disguise of poverty,\r\nthough it be for a day only, and to see myself in my true\r\ncharacter.  I have grave misgivings, however, as to Bimala ever\r\ngetting that fifty thousand rupees within her reach, and it will\r\nprobably be only a thousand or two which will actually come to\r\nhand.  Be it so.  The wise man is content with half a loaf, or\r\nany fraction for that matter, rather than no bread.  I must\r\nreturn to these personal reflections of mine later.  News comes\r\nthat I am wanted at once.  Something has gone wrong ...\r\n\r\nIt seems that the police have got a clue to the man who sank\r\nMirjan's boat for us.  He was an old offender.  They are on his\r\ntrail, but he should be too practised a hand to be caught\r\nblabbing.  However, one never knows.  Nikhil's back is up, and\r\nhis manager may not be able to have things his own way.\r\n\r\n\"If I get into trouble, sir,\" said the manager when I saw him, \"I\r\nshall have to drag you in!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the noose with which you can catch me?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have a letter of yours, and several of Amulya Babu's.\"  I\r\ncould not see that the letter marked \"urgent\" to which I had been\r\nhurried into writing a reply was wanted urgently for this purpose\r\nonly!  I am getting to learn quite a number of things.\r\n\r\nThe point now is, that the police must be bribed and hush-money\r\npaid to Mirjan for his boat.  It is also becoming evident that\r\nmuch of the cost of this patriotic venture of ours will find its\r\nway as profit into the pockets of Nikhil's manager.  However, I\r\nmust shut my eyes to that for the present, for is he not shouting\r\n__Bande Mataram__ as lustily as I am?\r\n\r\nThis kind of work has always to be carried on with leaky vessels\r\nwhich let as much through as they fetch in.  We all have a hidden\r\nfund of moral judgement stored away within us, and so I was about\r\nto wax indignant with the manager, and enter in my diary a tirade\r\nagainst the unreliability of our countrymen.  But, if there be a\r\ngod, I must acknowledge with gratitude to him that he has given\r\nme a clear-seeing mind, which allows nothing inside or outside it\r\nto remain vague.  I may delude others, but never myself.  So I\r\nwas unable to continue angry.\r\n\r\nWhatever is true is neither good nor bad, but simply true, and\r\nthat is Science.  A lake is only the remnant of water which has\r\nnot been sucked into the ground.  Underneath the cult of __Bande\r\nMataram__, as indeed at the bottom of all mundane affairs,\r\nthere is a region of slime, whose absorbing power must be\r\nreckoned with.  The manager will take what he wants; I also have\r\nmy own wants.  These lesser wants form a part of the wants of the\r\ngreat Cause--the horse must be fed and the wheels must be oiled\r\nif the best progress is to be made.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of it is that money we must have, and that\r\nsoon.  We must take whatever comes the readiest, for we cannot\r\nafford to wait.  I know that the immediate often swallows up the\r\nultimate; that the five thousand rupees of today may nip in the\r\nbud the fifty thousand rupees of tomorrow.  But I must accept the\r\npenalty.  Have I not often twitted Nikhil that they who walk in\r\nthe paths of restraint have never known what sacrifice is?  It is\r\nwe greedy folk who have to sacrifice our greed at every step!\r\n\r\nOf the cardinal sins of man, Desire is for men who are men--but\r\nDelusion, which is only for cowards, hampers them.  Because\r\ndelusion keeps them wrapped up in past and future, but is the\r\nvery deuce for confounding their footsteps in the present.  Those\r\nwho are always straining their ears for the call of the remote,\r\nto the neglect of the call of the imminent, are like Sakuntala\r\n[19] absorbed in the memories of her lover.  The guest comes\r\nunheeded, and the curse descends, depriving them of the very\r\nobject of their desire.\r\n\r\nThe other day I pressed Bimala's hand, and that touch still stirs\r\nher mind, as it vibrates in mine.  Its thrill must not be\r\ndeadened by repetition, for then what is now music will descend\r\nto mere argument.  There is at present no room in her mind for\r\nthe question \"why?\"  So I must not deprive Bimala, who is one of\r\nthose creatures for whom illusion is necessary, of her full\r\nsupply of it.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I have so much else to do that I shall have to be\r\ncontent for the present with the foam of the wine cup of passion.\r\nO man of desire!  Curb your greed, and practise your hand on the\r\nharp of illusion till you can bring out all the delicate nuances\r\nof suggestion.  This is not the time to drain the cup to the\r\ndregs.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n19. Sakuntala, after the king, her lover, went back to his\r\nkingdom, promising to send for her, was so lost in thoughts of\r\nhim, that she failed to hear the call of her hermit guest who\r\nthereupon cursed her, saying that the object of her love would\r\nforget all about her.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur work proceeds apace.  But though we have shouted ourselves\r\nhoarse, proclaiming the Mussulmans to be our brethren, we have\r\ncome to realize that we shall never be able to bring them wholly\r\nround to our side.  So they must be suppressed altogether and\r\nmade to understand that we are the masters.  They are now showing\r\ntheir teeth, but one day they shall dance like tame bears to the\r\ntune we play.\r\n\r\n\"If the idea of a United India is a true one,\" objects Nikhil,\r\n\"Mussulmans are a necessary part of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said I, \"but we must know their place and keep them\r\nthere, otherwise they will constantly be giving trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you want to make trouble to prevent trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is your plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one well-known way of avoiding quarrels,\" said\r\nNikhil meaningly.\r\n\r\nI know that, like tales written by good people, Nikhil's\r\ndiscourse always ends in a moral.  The strange part of it is that\r\nwith all his familiarity with moral precepts, he still believes\r\nin them!  He is an incorrigible schoolboy.  His only merit is his\r\nsincerity.  The mischief with people like him is that they will\r\nnot admit the finality even of death, but keep their eyes always\r\nfixed on a hereafter.\r\n\r\nI have long been nursing a plan which, if only I could carry it\r\nout, would set fire to the whole country.  True patriotism will\r\nnever be roused in our countrymen unless they can visualize the\r\nmotherland.  We must make a goddess of her.  My colleagues saw\r\nthe point at once.  \"Let us devise an appropriate image!\"  they\r\nexclaimed.  \"It will not do if you devise it,\" I admonished\r\nthem.  \"We must get one of the current images accepted as\r\nrepresenting the country--the worship of the people must flow\r\ntowards it along the deep-cut grooves of custom.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nikhil's needs must argue even about this.  \"We must not seek\r\nthe help of illusions,\" he said to me some time ago, \"for what we\r\nbelieve to be the true cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Illusions are necessary for lesser minds,\" I said, \"and to this\r\nclass the greater portion of the world belongs.  That is why\r\ndivinities are set up in every country to keep up the illusions\r\nof the people, for men are only too well aware of their\r\nweakness.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied.  \"God is necessary to clear away our illusions.\r\nThe divinities which keep them alive are false gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that?  If need be, even false gods must be invoked,\r\nrather than let the work suffer.  Unfortunately for us, our\r\nillusions are alive enough, but we do not know how to make them\r\nserve our purpose.  Look at the Brahmins.  In spite of our\r\ntreating them as demi-gods, and untiringly taking the dust of\r\ntheir feet, they are a force going to waste.\r\n\r\n\"There will always be a large class of people, given to\r\ngrovelling, who can never be made to do anything unless they are\r\nbespattered with the dust of somebody's feet, be it on their\r\nheads or on their backs!  What a pity if after keeping Brahmins\r\nsaved up in our armoury for all these ages--keen and serviceable\r\n--they cannot be utilized to urge on this rabble in the time of\r\nour need.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to drive all this into Nikhil's head.  He\r\nhas such a prejudice in favour of truth--as though there exists\r\nsuch an objective reality!  How often have I tried to explain to\r\nhim that where untruth truly exists, there it is indeed the\r\ntruth.  This was understood in our country in the old days, and\r\nso they had the courage to declare that for those of little\r\nunderstanding untruth is the truth.  For them, who can truly\r\nbelieve their country to be a goddess, her image will do duty for\r\nthe truth.  With our nature and our traditions we are unable to\r\nrealize our country as she is, but we can easily bring ourselves\r\nto believe in her image.  Those who want to do real work must not\r\nignore this fact.\r\n\r\nNikhil only got excited.  \"Because you have lost the power of\r\nwalking in the path of truth's attainment,\" he cried, \"you keep\r\nwaiting for some miraculous boon to drop from the skies!  That is\r\nwhy when your service to the country has fallen centuries into\r\narrears all you can think of is, to make of it an image and\r\nstretch out your hands in expectation of gratuitous favours.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want to perform the impossible,\" I said.  \"So our country\r\nneeds must be made into a god.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you have no heart for possible tasks,\" replied Nikhil.\r\n\"Whatever is already there is to be left undisturbed; yet there\r\nmust be a supernatural result:\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Nikhil,\" I said at length, thoroughly exasperated.\r\n\r\n\"The things you have been saying are good enough as moral\r\nlessons.  These ideas have served their purpose, as milk for\r\nbabes, at one stage of man's evolution, but will no longer do,\r\nnow that man has cut his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Do we not see before our very eyes how things, of which we never\r\neven dreamt of sowing the seed, are sprouting up on every side?\r\nBy what power?  That of the deity in our country who is becoming\r\nmanifest.  It is for the genius of the age to give that deity its\r\nimage.  Genius does not argue, it creates.  I only give form to\r\nwhat the country imagines.\r\n\r\n\"I will spread it abroad that the goddess has vouchsafed me a\r\ndream.  I will tell the Brahmins that they have been appointed\r\nher priests, and that their downfall has been due to their\r\ndereliction of duty in not seeing to the proper performance of\r\nher worship.  Do you say I shall be uttering lies?  No, say I, it\r\nis the truth--nay more, the truth which the country has so long\r\nbeen waiting to learn from my lips.  If only I could get the\r\nopportunity to deliver my message, you would see the stupendous\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I am afraid of,\" said Nikhil, \"is, that my lifetime is\r\nlimited and the result you speak of is not the final result.  It\r\nwill have after-effects which may not be immediately apparent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only seek the result,\" said I, \"which belongs to today.\"\r\n\r\n\"The result I seek,\" answered Nikhil, \"belongs to all time.\"\r\n\r\nNikhil may have had his share of Bengal's greatest gift--\r\nimagination, but he has allowed it to be overshadowed and nearly\r\nkilled by an exotic conscientiousness.  Just look at the worship\r\nof Durga which Bengal has carried to such heights.  That is one\r\nof her greatest achievements.  I can swear that Durga is a\r\npolitical goddess and was conceived as the image of the\r\n__Shakti__ of patriotism in the days when Bengal was praying\r\nto be delivered from Mussulman domination.  What other province\r\nof India has succeeded in giving such wonderful visual expression\r\nto the ideal of its quest?\r\n\r\nNothing betrayed Nikhil's loss of the divine gift of imagination\r\nmore conclusively than his reply to me.  \"During the Mussulman\r\ndomination,\" he said, \"the Maratha and the Sikh asked for fruit\r\nfrom the arms which they themselves took up.  The Bengali\r\ncontented himself with placing weapons in the hands of his\r\ngoddess and muttering incantations to her; and as his country did\r\nnot really happen to be a goddess the only fruit he got was the\r\nlopped-off heads of the goats and buffaloes of the sacrifice.\r\nThe day that we seek the good of the country along the path of\r\nrighteousness, He who is greater than our country will grant us\r\ntrue fruition.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate part of it is that Nikhil's words sound so fine\r\nwhen put down on paper.  My words, however, are not meant to be\r\nscribbled on paper, but to be scored into the heart of the\r\ncountry.  The Pandit records his Treatise on Agriculture in\r\nprinter's ink; but the cultivator at the point of his plough\r\nimpresses his endeavour deep in the soil.\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I next saw Bimala I pitched my key high without further ado.\r\n\"Have we been able,\" I began, \"to believe with all our heart in\r\nthe god for whose worship we have been born all these millions of\r\nyears, until he actually made himself visible to us?\r\n\r\n\"How often have I told you,\" I continued, \"that had I not seen\r\nyou I never would have known all my country as One.  I know not\r\nyet whether you rightly understand me.  The gods are invisible\r\nonly in their heaven--on earth they show themselves to mortal\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nBimala looked at me in a strange kind of way as she gravely\r\nreplied: \"Indeed I understand you, Sandip.\"  This was the first\r\ntime she called me plain Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"Krishna,\" I continued, \"whom Arjuna ordinarily knew only as the\r\ndriver of his chariot, had also His universal aspect, of which,\r\ntoo, Arjuna had a vision one day, and that day he saw the Truth.\r\nI have seen your Universal Aspect in my country.  The Ganges and\r\nthe Brahmaputra are the chains of gold that wind round and round\r\nyour neck; in the woodland fringes on the distant banks of the\r\ndark waters of the river, I have seen your collyrium-darkened\r\neyelashes; the changeful sheen of your __sari__ moves for me\r\nin the play of light and shade amongst the swaying shoots of\r\ngreen corn; and the blazing summer heat, which makes the whole\r\nsky lie gasping like a red-tongued lion in the desert, is nothing\r\nbut your cruel radiance.\r\n\r\n\"Since the goddess has vouchsafed her presence to her votary in\r\nsuch wonderful guise, it is for me to proclaim her worship\r\nthroughout our land, and then shall the country gain new life.\r\n'Your image make we in temple after temple.' [20] But this our\r\npeople have not yet fully realized.  So I would call on them in\r\nyour name and offer for their worship an image from which none\r\nshall be able to withhold belief.  Oh give me this boon, this\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nBimala's eyelids drooped and she became rigid in her seat like a\r\nfigure of stone.  Had I continued she would have gone off into a\r\ntrance.  When I ceased speaking she opened wide her eyes, and\r\nmurmured with fixed gaze, as though still dazed: \"O Traveller in\r\nthe path of Destruction!  Who is there that can stay your\r\nprogress?  Do I not see that none shall stand in the way of your\r\ndesires?  Kings shall lay their crowns at your feet; the wealthy\r\nshall hasten to throw open their treasure for your acceptance;\r\nthose who have nothing else shall beg to be allowed to offer\r\ntheir lives.  O my king, my god!  What you have seen in me I know\r\nnot, but I have seen the immensity of your grandeur in my heart.\r\nWho am I, what am I, in its presence?  Ah, the awful power of\r\nDevastation!  Never shall I truly live till it kills me utterly!\r\nI can bear it no longer, my heart is breaking!\"\r\n\r\nBimala slid down from her seat and fell at my feet, which she\r\nclasped, and then she sobbed and sobbed and sobbed.\r\n\r\nThis is hypnotism indeed--the charm which can subdue the world!\r\nNo materials, no weapons--but just the delusion of irresistible\r\nsuggestion.  Who says \"Truth shall Triumph\"?  [21] Delusion\r\nshall win in the end.  The Bengali understood this when he\r\nconceived the image of the ten-handed goddess astride her lion,\r\nand spread her worship in the land.  Bengal must now create a new\r\nimage to enchant and conquer the world.  __Bande Mataram__!\r\n\r\nI gently lifted Bimala back into her chair, and lest reaction\r\nshould set in, I began again without losing time: \"Queen!  The\r\nDivine Mother has laid on me the duty of establishing her worship\r\nin the land.  But, alas, I am poor!\"\r\n\r\nBimala was still flushed, her eyes clouded, her accents thick, as\r\nshe replied: \"You poor?  Is not all that each one has yours?\r\nWhat are my caskets full of jewellery for?  Drag away from me all\r\nmy gold and gems for your worship.  I have no use for them!\"\r\n\r\nOnce before Bimala had offered up her ornaments.  I am not\r\nusually in the habit of drawing lines, but I felt I had to draw\r\nthe line there.  [22] I know why I feel this hesitation.  It is\r\nfor man to give ornaments to woman; to take them from her wounds\r\nhis manliness.\r\n\r\nBut I must forget myself.  Am I taking them?  They are for the\r\nDivine Mother, to be poured in worship at her feet.  Oh, but it\r\nmust be a grand ceremony of worship such as the country has never\r\nbeheld before.  It must be a landmark in our history.  It shall\r\nbe my supreme legacy to the Nation.  Ignorant men worship gods.\r\nI, Sandip, shall create them.\r\n\r\nBut all this is a far cry.  What about the urgent immediate?  At\r\nleast three thousand is indispensably necessary--five thousand\r\nwould do roundly and nicely.  But how on earth am I to mention\r\nmoney after the high flight we have just taken?  And yet time is\r\nprecious!\r\n\r\nI crushed all hesitation under foot as I jumped up and made my\r\nplunge: \"Queen!  Our purse is empty, our work about to stop!\"\r\n\r\nBimala winced.  I could see she was thinking of that impossible\r\nfifty thousand rupees.  What a load she must have been carrying\r\nwithin her bosom, struggling under it, perhaps, through sleepless\r\nnights!  What else had she with which to express her loving\r\nworship?  Debarred from offering her heart at my feet, she\r\nhankers to make this sum of money, so hopelessly large for her,\r\nthe bearer of her imprisoned feelings.  The thought of what she\r\nmust have gone through gives me a twinge of pain; for she is now\r\nwholly mine.  The wrench of plucking up the plant by the roots is\r\nover.  It is now only careful tending and nurture that is needed.\r\n\r\n\"Queen!\"  said I, \"that fifty thousand rupees is not particularly\r\nwanted just now.  I calculate that, for the present, five\r\nthousand or even three will serve.\"\r\n\r\nThe relief made her heart rebound.  \"I shall fetch you five\r\nthousand,\" she said in tones which seemed like an outburst of\r\nsong--the song which Radhika of the Vaishnava lyrics sang:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  For my lover will I bind in my hair\r\n  The flower which has no equal in the three worlds!\r\n*/\r\n\r\n--it is the same tune, the same song: five thousand will I bring!\r\nThat flower will I bind in my hair!\r\n\r\nThe narrow restraint of the flute brings out this quality of\r\nsong.  I must not allow the pressure of too much greed to flatten\r\nout the reed, for then, as I fear, music will give place to the\r\nquestions \"Why?\"  \"What is the use of so much?\"  \"How am I to get\r\nit?\"--not a word of which will rhyme with what Radhika sang!  So,\r\nas I was saying, illusion alone is real--it is the flute itself;\r\nwhile truth is but its empty hollow.  Nikhil has of late got a\r\ntaste of that pure emptiness--one can see it in his face, which\r\npains even me.  But it was Nikhil's boast that he wanted the\r\nTruth, while mine was that I would never let go illusion from my\r\ngrasp.  Each has been suited to his taste, so why complain?\r\n\r\nTo keep Bimala's heart in the rarefied air of idealism, I cut\r\nshort all further discussion over the five thousand rupees.  I\r\nreverted to the demon-destroying goddess and her worship.  When\r\nwas the ceremony to be held and where?  There is a great annual\r\nfair at Ruimari, within Nikhil's estates, where hundreds of\r\nthousands of pilgrims assemble.  That would be a grand place to\r\ninaugurate the worship of our goddess!\r\n\r\nBimala waxed intensely enthusiastic.  This was not the burning of\r\nforeign cloth or the people's granaries, so even Nikhil could\r\nhave no objection--so thought she.  But I smiled inwardly.  How\r\nlittle these two persons, who have been together, day and night,\r\nfor nine whole years, know of each other!  They know something\r\nperhaps of their home life, but when it comes to outside concerns\r\nthey are entirely at sea.  They had cherished the belief that the\r\nharmony of the home with the outside was perfect.  Today they\r\nrealize to their cost that it is too late to repair their neglect\r\nof years, and seek to harmonize them now.\r\n\r\nWhat does it matter?  Let those who have made the mistake learn\r\ntheir error by knocking against the world.  Why need I bother\r\nabout their plight?  For the present I find it wearisome to keep\r\nBimala soaring much longer, like a captive balloon, in regions\r\nethereal.  I had better get quite through with the matter in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhen Bimala rose to depart and had neared the door I remarked in\r\nmy most casual manner: \"So, about the money ...\"\r\n\r\nBimala halted and faced back as she said: \"On the expiry of the\r\nmonth, when our personal allowances become due ...\"\r\n\r\n\"That, I am afraid, would be much too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do you want it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow you shall have it.\"\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n20. A line from Bankim Chatterjee's national song __Bande\r\nMataram__.\r\n\r\n21. A quotation from the Upanishads.\r\n\r\n22. There is a world of sentiment attached to the ornaments worn\r\nby women in Bengal.\r\n\r\nThey are not merely indicative of the love and regard of the\r\ngiver, but the wearing of them symbolizes all that is held best\r\nin wifehood--the constant solicitude for her husband's welfare,\r\nthe successful performance of the material and spiritual duties\r\nof the household entrusted to her care.  When the husband dies,\r\nand the responsibility for the household changes hands, then are\r\nall ornaments cast aside as a sign of the widow's renunciation of\r\nworldly concerns.  At any other time the giving up of omaments is\r\nalways a sign of supreme distress and as such appeals acutely to\r\nthe sense of chivalry of any Bengali who may happen to witness it\r\n[Trans.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eight\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAGRAPHS and letters against me have begun to come out in the\r\nlocal papers; cartoons and lampoons are to follow, I am told.\r\nJets of wit and humour are being splashed about, and the lies\r\nthus scattered are convulsing the whole country.  They know that\r\nthe monopoly of mud-throwing is theirs, and the innocent passer-\r\nby cannot escape unsoiled.\r\n\r\nThey are saying that the residents in my estates, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest, are in favour of __Swadeshi__, but they\r\ndare not declare themselves, for fear of me.  The few who have\r\nbeen brave enough to defy me have felt the full rigour of my\r\npersecution.  I am in secret league with the police, and in\r\nprivate communication with the magistrate, and these frantic\r\nefforts of mine to add a foreign title of my own earning to the\r\none I have inherited, will not, it is opined, go in vain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the papers are full of praise for those\r\ndevoted sons of the motherland, the Kundu and the Chakravarti\r\n__zamindars__.  If only, say they, the country had a few more\r\nof such staunch patriots, the mills of Manchester would have, had\r\nto sound their own dirge to the tune of __Bande Mataram__.\r\n\r\nThen comes a letter in blood-red ink, giving a list of the\r\ntraitorous __zamindars__ whose treasuries have been burnt down\r\nbecause of their failing to support the Cause.  Holy Fire, it\r\ngoes on to say, has been aroused to its sacred function of\r\npurifying the country; and other agencies are also at work to see\r\nthat those who are not true sons of the motherland do cease to\r\nencumber her lap.  The signature is an obvious __nom-de-\r\nplume__.\r\n\r\nI could see that this was the doing of our local students.  So I\r\nsent for some of them and showed them the letter.\r\n\r\nThe B.A.  student gravely informed me that they also had heard\r\nthat a band of desperate patriots had been formed who would stick\r\nat nothing in order to clear away all obstacles to the success of\r\n__Swadeshi__.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said I, \"even one of our countrymen succumbs to these\r\noverbearing desperadoes, that will indeed be a defeat for the\r\ncountry!\"\r\n\r\n\"We fail to follow you, Maharaja,\" said the history student.\r\n\"'Our country,\" I tried to explain, \"has been brought to death's\r\ndoor through sheer fear--from fear of the gods down to fear of\r\nthe police; and if you set up, in the name of freedom, the fear\r\nof some other bogey, whatever it may be called; if you would\r\nraise your victorious standard on the cowardice of the country by\r\nmeans of downright oppression, then no true lover of the country\r\ncan bow to your decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any country, sir,\" pursued the history student, \"where\r\nsubmission to Government is not due to fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"The freedom that exists in any country,\" I replied, \"may be\r\nmeasured by the extent of this reign of fear.  Where its threat\r\nis confined to those who would hurt or plunder, there the\r\nGovernment may claim to have freed man from the violence of man.\r\nBut if fear is to regulate how people are to dress, where they\r\nshall trade, or what they must eat, then is man's freedom of will\r\nutterly ignored, and manhood destroyed at the root.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not such coercion of the individual will seen in other\r\ncountries too?\"  continued the history student.\r\n\r\n\"Who denies it?\"  I exclaimed.  \"But in every country man has\r\ndestroyed himself to the extent that he has permitted slavery to\r\nflourish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it not rather show,\" interposed a Master of Arts, \"that\r\ntrading in slavery is inherent in man--a fundamental fact of his\r\nnature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sandip Babu made the whole thing clear,\" said a graduate.  \"He\r\ngave us the example of Harish Kundu, your neighbouring\r\n__zamindar__.  From his estates you cannot ferret out a single\r\nounce of foreign salt.  Why?  Because he has always ruled with an\r\niron hand.  In the case of those who are slaves by nature, the\r\nlack of a strong master is the greatest of all calamities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir!\"  chimed in an undergraduate, \"have you not heard of\r\nthe obstreperous tenant of Chakravarti, the other __zamindar__\r\nclose by--how the law was set on him till he was reduced to utter\r\ndestitution?  When at last he was left with nothing to eat, he\r\nstarted out to sell his wife's silver ornaments, but no one dared\r\nbuy them.  Then Chakravarti's manager offered him five rupees for\r\nthe lot.  They were worth over thirty, but he had to accept or\r\nstarve.  After taking over the bundle from him the manager coolly\r\nsaid that those five rupees would be credited towards his rent!\r\nWe felt like having nothing more to do with Chakravarti or his\r\nmanager after that, but Sandip Babu told us that if we threw over\r\nall the live people, we should have only dead bodies from the\r\nburning-grounds to carry on the work with!  These live men, he\r\npointed out, know what they want and how to get it--they are born\r\nrulers.  Those who do not know how to desire for themselves, must\r\nlive in accordance with, or die by virtue of, the desires of such\r\nas these.  Sandip Babu contrasted them--Kundu and Chakravarti--\r\nwith you, Maharaja.  You, he said, for all your good intentions,\r\nwill never succeed in planting __Swadeshi__ within your\r\nterritory.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my desire,\" I said, \"to plant something greater than\r\n__Swadeshi__.  I am not after dead logs but living trees--and\r\nthese will take time to grow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, sir,\" sneered the history student, \"that you will\r\nget neither log nor tree.  Sandip Babu rightly teaches that in\r\norder to get, you must snatch.  This is taking all of us some\r\ntime to learn, because it runs counter to what we were taught at\r\nschool.  I have seen with my own eyes that when a rent-collector\r\nof Harish Kundu's found one of the tenants with nothing which\r\ncould be sold up to pay his rent, he was made to sell his young\r\nwife!  Buyers were not wanting, and the __zamindar's__ demand\r\nwas satisfied.  I tell you, sir, the sight of that man's distress\r\nprevented my getting sleep for nights together!  But, feel it as\r\nI did, this much I realized, that the man who knows how to get\r\nthe money he is out for, even by selling up his debtor's wife, is\r\na better man than I am.  I confess it is beyond me--I am a\r\nweakling, my eyes fill with tears.  If anybody can save our\r\ncountry it is these Kundus and these Chakravartis and their\r\nofficials!\"\r\n\r\nI was shocked beyond words.  \"If what you say be true,\" I cried,\r\n\"I clearly see that it must be the one endeavour of my life to\r\nsave the country from these same Kundus and Chakravartis and\r\nofficials.  The slavery that has entered into our very bones is\r\nbreaking out, at this opportunity, as ghastly tyranny.  You have\r\nbeen so used to submit to domination through fear, you have come\r\nto believe that to make others submit is a kind of religion.  My\r\nfight shall be against this weakness, this atrocious cruelty!\"\r\nThese things, which are so simple to ordinary folk, get so\r\ntwisted in the minds of our B.A.'s and M.A.'s, the only purpose\r\nof whose historical quibbles seems to be to torture the truth!\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am worried over Panchu's sham aunt.  It will be difficult to\r\ndisprove her, for though witnesses of a real event may be few or\r\neven wanting, innumerable proofs of a thing that has not happened\r\ncan always be marshalled.  The object of this move is, evidently,\r\nto get the sale of Panchu's holding to me set aside.  Being\r\nunable to find any other way out of it, I was thinking of\r\nallowing Panchu to hold a permanent tenure in my estates and\r\nbuilding him a cottage on it.  But my master would not have it.\r\nI should not give in to these nefarious tactics so easily, he\r\nobjected, and offered to attend to the matter himself.\r\n\r\n\"You, sir!\"  I cried, considerably surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nI could not see, at all clearly, what my master could do to\r\ncounteract these legal machinations.  That evening, at the time\r\nhe usually came to me, he did not turn up.  On my making\r\ninquiries, his servant said he had left home with a few things\r\npacked in a small trunk, and some bedding, saying he would be\r\nback in a few days.  I thought he might have sallied forth to\r\nhunt for witnesses in Panchu's uncle's village.  In that case,\r\nhowever, I was sure that his would be a hopeless quest ...\r\n\r\nDuring the day I forget myself in my work.  As the late autumn\r\nafternoon wears on, the colours of the sky become turbid, and so\r\ndo the feelings of my mind.  There are many in this world whose\r\nminds dwell in brick-built houses--they can afford to ignore the\r\nthing called the outside.  But my mind lives under the trees in\r\nthe open, directly receives upon itself the messages borne by the\r\nfree winds, and responds from the bottom of its heart to all the\r\nmusical cadences of light and darkness.\r\n\r\nWhile the day is bright and the world in the pursuit of its\r\nnumberless tasks crowds around, then it seems as if my life wants\r\nnothing else.  But when the colours of the sky fade away and the\r\nblinds are drawn down over the windows of heaven, then my heart\r\ntells me that evening falls just for the purpose of shutting out\r\nthe world, to mark the time when the darkness must be filled with\r\nthe One.  This is the end to which earth, sky, and waters\r\nconspire, and I cannot harden myself against accepting its\r\nmeaning.  So when the gloaming deepens over the world, like the\r\ngaze of the dark eyes of the beloved, then my whole being tells\r\nme that work alone cannot be the truth of life, that work is not\r\nthe be-all and the end-all of man, for man is not simply a serf--\r\neven though the serfdom be of the True and the Good.\r\n\r\nAlas, Nikhil, have you for ever parted company with that self of\r\nyours who used to be set free under the starlight, to plunge into\r\nthe infinite depths of the night's darkness after the day's work\r\nwas done?  How terribly alone is he, who misses companionship in\r\nthe midst of the multitudinousness of life.\r\n\r\nThe other day, when the afternoon had reached the meeting-point\r\nof day and night, I had no work, nor the mind for work, nor was\r\nmy master there to keep me company.  With my empty, drifting\r\nheart longing to anchor on to something, I traced my steps\r\ntowards the inner gardens.  I was very fond of chrysanthemums and\r\nhad rows of them, of all varieties, banked up in pots against one\r\nof the garden walls.  When they were in flower, it looked like a\r\nwave of green breaking into iridescent foam.  It was some time\r\nsince I had been to this part of the grounds, and I was beguiled\r\ninto a cheerful expectancy at the thought of meeting my\r\nchrysanthemums after our long separation.\r\n\r\nAs I went in, the full moon had just peeped over the wall, her\r\nslanting rays leaving its foot in deep shadow.  It seemed as if\r\nshe had come a-tiptoe from behind, and clasped the darkness over\r\nthe eyes, smiling mischievously.  When I came near the bank of\r\nchrysanthemums, I saw a figure stretched on the grass in front.\r\nMy heart gave a sudden thud.  The figure also sat up with a start\r\nat my footsteps.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done next?  I was wondering whether it would do to\r\nbeat a precipitate retreat.  Bimala, also, was doubtless casting\r\nabout for some way of escape.  But it was as awkward to go as to\r\nstay!  Before I could make up my mind, Bimala rose, pulled the\r\nend of her __sari__ over her head, and walked off towards the\r\ninner apartments.\r\n\r\nThis brief pause had been enough to make real to me the cruel\r\nload of Bimala's misery.  The plaint of my own life vanished from\r\nme in a moment.  I called out: \"Bimala!\"\r\n\r\nShe started and stayed her steps, but did not turn back.  I went\r\nround and stood before her.  Her face was in the shade, the\r\nmoonlight fell on mine.  Her eyes were downcast, her hands\r\nclenched.\r\n\r\n\"Bimala,\" said I, \"why should I seek to keep you fast in this\r\nclosed cage of mine?  Do I not know that thus you cannot but pine\r\nand droop?\"\r\n\r\nShe stood still, without raising her eyes or uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I continued, \"that if I insist on keeping you shackled\r\nmy whole life will be reduced to nothing but an iron chain.  What\r\npleasure can that be to me?\"\r\n\r\nShe was still silent.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I concluded, \"I tell you, truly, Bimala, you are free.\r\nWhatever I may or may not have been to you, I refuse to be your\r\nfetters.\"  With which I came away towards the outer apartments.\r\n\r\nNo, no, it was not a generous impulse, nor indifference.  I had\r\nsimply come to understand that never would I be free until I\r\ncould set free.  To try to keep Bimala as a garland round my\r\nneck, would have meant keeping a weight hanging over my heart.\r\nHave I not been praying with all my strength, that if happiness\r\nmay not be mine, let it go; if grief needs must be my lot, let it\r\ncome; but let me not be kept in bondage.  To clutch hold of that\r\nwhich is untrue as though it were true, is only to throttle\r\noneself.  May I be saved from such self-destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered my room, I found my master waiting there.  My\r\nagitated feelings were still heaving within me.  \"Freedom, sir,\"\r\nI began unceremoniously, without greeting or inquiry, \"freedom is\r\nthe biggest thing for man.  Nothing can be compared to it--\r\nnothing at all!\"\r\n\r\nSurprised at my outburst, my master looked up at me in silence.\r\n\r\n\"One can understand nothing from books,\" I went on.  \"We read in\r\nthe scriptures that our desires are bonds, fettering us as well\r\nas others.  But such words, by themselves, are so empty.  It is\r\nonly when we get to the point of letting the bird out of its cage\r\nthat we can realize how free the bird has set us.  Whatever we\r\ncage, shackles us with desire whose bonds are stronger than those\r\nof iron chains.  I tell you, sir, this is just what the world has\r\nfailed to understand.  They all seek to reform something outside\r\nthemselves.  But reform is wanted only in one's own desires,\r\nnowhere else, nowhere else!\"\r\n\r\n\"We think,\" he said, \"that we are our own masters when we get in\r\nour hands the object of our desire--but we are really our own\r\nmasters only when we are able to cast out our desires from our\r\nminds.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we put all this into words, sir,\" I went on, \"it sounds\r\nlike some bald-headed injunction, but when we realize even a\r\nlittle of it we find it to be __amrita__--which the gods have\r\ndrunk and become immortal.  We cannot see Beauty till we let go\r\nour hold of it.  It was Buddha who conquered the world, not\r\nAlexander--this is untrue when stated in dry prose--oh when shall\r\nwe be able to sing it?  When shall all these most intimate truths\r\nof the universe overflow the pages of printed books and leap out\r\nin a sacred stream like the Ganges from the Gangotrie?\"\r\n\r\nI was suddenly reminded of my master's absence during the last\r\nfew days and of my ignorance as to its reason.  I felt somewhat\r\nfoolish as I asked him: \"And where have you been all this while,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Staying with Panchu,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Have you been there all these days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I wanted to come to an understanding with the woman who\r\ncalls herself his aunt.  She could hardly be induced to believe\r\nthat there could be such an odd character among the gentlefolk as\r\nthe one who sought their hospitality.  When she found I really\r\nmeant to stay on, she began to feel rather ashamed of herself.\r\n'Mother,' said I, 'you are not going to get rid of me, even if\r\nyou abuse me!  And so long as I stay, Panchu stays also.  For you\r\nsee, do you not, that I cannot stand by and see his motherless\r\nlittle ones sent out into the streets?'\r\n\r\n\"She listened to my talks in this strain for a couple of days\r\nwithout saying yes or no.  This morning I found her tying up her\r\nbundles.  'We are going back to Brindaban,' she said.  'Let us\r\nhave our expenses for the journey.' I knew she was not going to\r\nBrindaban, and also that the cost of her journey would be\r\nsubstantial.  So I have come to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The required cost shall be paid,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"The old woman is not a bad sort,\" my master went on musingly.\r\n\"Panchu was not sure of her caste, and would not let her touch\r\nthe water-jar, or anything at all of his.  So they were\r\ncontinually bickering.  When she found I had no objection to her\r\ntouch, she looked after me devotedly.  She is a splendid cook!\r\n\r\n\"But all remnants of Panchu's respect for me vanished!  To the\r\nlast he had thought that I was at least a simple sort of person.\r\nBut here was I, risking my caste without a qualm to win over the\r\nold woman for my purpose.  Had I tried to steal a march on her by\r\ntutoring a witness for the trial, that would have been a\r\ndifferent matter.  Tactics must be met by tactics.  But stratagem\r\nat the expense of orthodoxy is more than he can tolerate!\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I must stay on a few days at Panchu's even after the\r\nwoman leaves, for Harish Kundu may be up to any kind of devilry.\r\nHe has been telling his satellites that he was content to have\r\nfurnished Panchu with an aunt, but I have gone the length of\r\nsupplying him with a father.  He would like to see, now, how many\r\nfathers of his can save him!\"\r\n\r\n\"We may or may not be able to save him,\" I said; \"but if we\r\nshould perish in the attempt to save the country from the\r\nthousand-and-one snares--of religion, custom and selfishness--\r\nwhich these people are busy spreading, we shall at least die\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could have thought that so much would happen in this one\r\nlife?  I feel as if I have passed through a whole series of\r\nbirths, time has been flying so fast, I did not feel it move at\r\nall, till the shock came the other day.\r\n\r\nI knew there would be words between us when I made up my mind to\r\nask my husband to banish foreign goods from our market.  But it\r\nwas my firm belief that I had no need to meet argument by\r\nargument, for there was magic in the very air about me.  Had not\r\nso tremendous a man as Sandip fallen helplessly at my feet, like\r\na wave of the mighty sea breaking on the shore?  Had I called\r\nhim?  No, it was the summons of that magic spell of mine.  And\r\nAmulya, poor dear boy, when he first came to me--how the current\r\nof his life flushed with colour, like the river at dawn!  Truly\r\nhave I realized how a goddess feels when she looks upon the\r\nradiant face of her devotee.\r\n\r\nWith the confidence begotten of these proofs of my power, I was\r\nready to meet my husband like a lightning-charged cloud.  But\r\nwhat was it that happened?  Never in all these nine years have I\r\nseen such a far-away, distraught look in his eyes--like the\r\ndesert sky--with no merciful moisture of its own, no colour\r\nreflected, even, from what it looked upon.  I should have been so\r\nrelieved if his anger had flashed out!  But I could find nothing\r\nin him which I could touch.  I felt as unreal as a dream--a dream\r\nwhich would leave only the blackness of night when it was over.\r\n\r\nIn the old days I used to be jealous of my sister-in-law for her\r\nbeauty.  Then I used to feel that Providence had given me no\r\npower of my own, that my whole strength lay in the love which my\r\nhusband had bestowed on me.  Now that I had drained to the dregs\r\nthe cup of power and could not do without its intoxication, I\r\nsuddenly found it dashed to pieces at my feet, leaving me nothing\r\nto live for.\r\n\r\nHow feverishly I had sat to do my hair that day.  Oh, shame,\r\nshame on me, the utter shame of it!  My sister-in-law, when\r\npassing by, had exclaimed: \"Aha, Chota Rani!  Your hair seems\r\nready to jump off.  Don't let it carry your head with it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, the other day in the garden, how easy my husband found\r\nit to tell me that he set me free!  But can freedom--empty\r\nfreedom--be given and taken so easily as all that?  It is like\r\nsetting a fish free in the sky--for how can I move or live\r\noutside the atmosphere of loving care which has always sustained\r\nme?\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my room today, I saw only furniture--only the\r\nbedstead, only the looking-glass, only the clothes-rack--not the\r\nall-pervading heart which used to be there, over all.  Instead of\r\nit there was freedom, only freedom, mere emptiness!  A dried-up\r\nwatercourse with all its rocks and pebbles laid bare.  No\r\nfeeling, only furniture!\r\n\r\nWhen I had arrived at a state of utter bewilderment, wondering\r\nwhether anything true was left in my life, and whereabouts it\r\ncould be, I happened to meet Sandip again.  Then life struck\r\nagainst life, and the sparks flew in the same old way.  Here was\r\ntruth--impetuous truth--which rushed in and overflowed all\r\nbounds, truth which was a thousand times truer than the Bara Rani\r\nwith her maid, Thako and her silly songs, and all the rest of\r\nthem who talked and laughed and wandered about ...\r\n\r\n\"Fifty thousand!\"  Sandip had demanded.\r\n\r\n\"What is fifty thousand?\"  cried my intoxicated heart.  \"You\r\nshall have it!\"\r\n\r\nHow to get it, where to get it, were minor points not worth\r\ntroubling over.  Look at me.  Had I not risen, all in one moment,\r\nfrom my nothingness to a height above everything?  So shall all\r\nthings come at my beck and call.  I shall get it, get it, get it\r\n--there cannot be any doubt.\r\n\r\nThus had I come away from Sandip the other day.  Then as I looked\r\nabout me, where was it--the tree of plenty?  Oh, why does this\r\nouter world insult the heart so?\r\n\r\nAnd yet get it I must; how, I do not care; for sin there cannot\r\nbe.  Sin taints only the weak; I with my __Shakti__ am beyond\r\nits reach.  Only a commoner can be a thief, the king conquers and\r\ntakes his rightful spoil ...  I must find out where the treasury\r\nis; who takes the money in; who guards it.\r\n\r\nI spent half the night standing in the outer verandah peering at\r\nthe row of office buildings.  But how to get that fifty thousand\r\nrupees out of the clutches of those iron bars?  If by some\r\n__mantram__ I could have made all those guards fall dead in\r\ntheir places, I would not have hesitated--so pitiless did I feel!\r\n\r\nBut while a whole gang of robbers seemed dancing a war-dance\r\nwithin the whirling brain of its Rani, the great house of the\r\nRajas slept in peace.  The gong of the watch sounded hour after\r\nhour, and the sky overhead placidly looked on.\r\n\r\nAt last I sent for Amulya.\r\n\r\n\"Money is wanted for the Cause,\" I told him.  \"Can you not get it\r\nout of the treasury?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"  said he, with his chest thrown out.\r\n\r\nAlas!  had I not said \"Why not?\"  to Sandip just in the same way?\r\nThe poor lad's confidence could rouse no hopes in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"How will you do it?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\nThe wild plans he began to unfold would hardly bear repetition\r\noutside the pages of a penny dreadful.\r\n\r\n\"No, Amulya,\" I said severely, \"you must not be childish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" he said, \"let me bribe those watchmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the money to come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can loot the bazar,\" he burst out, without blenching.\r\n\r\n\"Leave all that alone.  I have my ornaments, they will serve.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Amulya, \"it strikes me that the cashier cannot be\r\nbribed.  Never mind, there is another and simpler way.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why need you hear it?  It is quite simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I should like to know.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya fumbled in the pocket of his tunic and pulled out, first a\r\nsmall edition of the __Gita__, which he placed on the table--\r\nand then a little pistol, which he showed me, but said nothing\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nHorror!  It did not take him a moment to make up his mind to kill\r\nour good old cashier!  [23] To look at his frank, open face one\r\nwould not have thought him capable of hurting a fly, but how\r\ndifferent were the words which came from his mouth.  It was clear\r\nthat the cashier's place in the world meant nothing real to him;\r\nit was a mere vacancy, lifeless, feelingless, with only stock\r\nphrases from the __Gita--Who kills the body kills naught! __\r\n\r\n\"Whatever do you mean, Amulya?\"  I exclaimed at length.  \"Don't\r\nyou know that the dear old man has got a wife and children and\r\nthat he is ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we to find men who have no wives and children?\"  he\r\ninterrupted.  \"Look here, Maharani, the thing we call pity is, at\r\nbottom, only pity for ourselves.  We cannot bear to wound our own\r\ntender instincts, and so we do not strike at all--pity indeed!\r\nThe height of cowardice!\"\r\n\r\nTo hear Sandip's phrases in the mouth of this mere boy staggered\r\nme.  So delightfully, lovably immature was he--of that age when\r\nthe good may still be believed in as good, of that age when one\r\nreally lives and grows.  The Mother in me awoke.\r\n\r\nFor myself there was no longer good or bad--only death, beautiful\r\nalluring death.  But to hear this stripling calmly talk of\r\nmurdering an inoffensive old man as the right thing to do, made\r\nme shudder all over.  The more clearly I saw that there was no\r\nsin in his heart, the more horrible appeared to me the sin of his\r\nwords.  I seemed to see the sin of the parents visited on the\r\ninnocent child.\r\n\r\nThe sight of his great big eyes shining with faith and enthusiasm\r\ntouched me to the quick.  He was going, in his fascination,\r\nstraight to the jaws of the python, from which, once in, there\r\nwas no return.  How was he to be saved?  Why does not my country\r\nbecome, for once, a real Mother--clasp him to her bosom and cry\r\nout: \"Oh, my child, my child, what profits it that you should\r\nsave me, if so it be that I should fail to save you?\"\r\n\r\nI know, I know, that all Power on earth waxes great under compact\r\nwith Satan.  But the Mother is there, alone though she be, to\r\ncontemn and stand against this devil's progress.  The Mother\r\ncares not for mere success, however great--she wants to give\r\nlife, to save life.  My very soul, today, stretches out its hands\r\nin yearning to save this child.\r\n\r\nA while ago I suggested robbery to him.  Whatever I may now say\r\nagainst it will be put down to a woman's weakness.  They only\r\nlove our weakness when it drags the world in its toils!\r\n\r\n\"You need do nothing at all, Amulya, I will see to the money,\" I\r\ntold him finally.  When he had almost reached the door, I called\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n\"Amulya,\" said I, \"I am your elder sister.  Today is not the\r\nBrothers' Day [24] according to the calendar, but all the days in\r\nthe year are really Brothers' Days.  My blessing be with you: may\r\nGod keep you always.\"\r\n\r\nThese unexpected words from my lips took Amulya by surprise.  He\r\nstood stock-still for a time.  Then, coming to himself, he\r\nprostrated himself at my feet in acceptance of the relationship\r\nand did me reverence.  When he rose his eyes were full of tears\r\n...  O little brother mine!  I am fast going to my death--let me\r\ntake all your sin away with me.  May no taint from me ever\r\ntarnish your innocence!\r\n\r\nI said to him: \"Let your offering of reverence be that pistol!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with it, sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will practise death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, sister.  Our women, also, must know how to die, to deal\r\ndeath!\"  with which Amulya handed me the pistol.  The radiance of\r\nhis youthful countenance seemed to tinge my life with the touch\r\nof a new dawn.  I put away the pistol within my clothes.  May\r\nthis reverence-offering be the last resource in my extremity ...\r\n\r\nThe door to the mother's chamber in my woman's heart once opened,\r\nI thought it would always remain open.  But this pathway to the\r\nsupreme good was closed when the mistress took the place of the\r\nmother and locked it again.  The very next day I saw Sandip; and\r\nmadness, naked and rampant, danced upon my heart.\r\n\r\nWhat was this?  Was this, then, my truer self?  Never!  I had\r\nnever before known this shameless, this cruel one within me.  The\r\nsnake-charmer had come, pretending to draw this snake from within\r\nthe fold of my garment--but it was never there, it was his all\r\nthe time.  Some demon has gained possession of me, and what I am\r\ndoing today is the play of his activity--it has nothing to do\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nThis demon, in the guise of a god, had come with his ruddy torch\r\nto call me that day, saying: \"I am your Country.  I am your\r\nSandip.  I am more to you than anything else of yours.  __Bande\r\nMataram__!\"  And with folded hands I had responded: \"You are my\r\nreligion.  You are my heaven.  Whatever else is mine shall be\r\nswept away before my love for you.  __Bande Mataram__!\"\r\n\r\nFive thousand is it?  Five thousand it shall be!  You want it\r\ntomorrow?  Tomorrow you shall have it!  In this desperate orgy,\r\nthat gift of five thousand shall be as the foam of wine--and then\r\nfor the riotous revel!  The immovable world shall sway under our\r\nfeet, fire shall flash from our eyes, a storm shall roar in our\r\nears, what is or is not in front shall become equally dim.  And\r\nthen with tottering footsteps we shall plunge to our death--in a\r\nmoment all fire will be extinguished, the ashes will be\r\nscattered, and nothing will remain behind.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n23. The cashier is the official who is most in touch with the\r\nladies of a __zamindar's__ household, directly taking their\r\nrequisitions for household stores and doing their shopping for\r\nthem, and so he becomes more a member of the family than the\r\nothers.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\n24. The daughter of the house occupies a place of specially\r\ntender affection in a Bengali household (perhaps in Hindu\r\nhouseholds all over India) because, by dictate of custom, she\r\nmust be given away in marriage so early.  She thus takes\r\ncorresponding memories with her to her husband's home, where she\r\nhas to begin as a stranger before she can get into her place.\r\nThe resulting feeling, of the mistress of her new home for the\r\none she has left, has taken ceremonial form as the Brothers' Day,\r\non which the brothers are invited to the married sisters' houses.\r\nWhere the sister is the elder, she offers her blessing and\r\nreceives the brother's reverence, and vice versa.  Presents,\r\ncalled the offerings of reverence (or blessing), are exchanged.\r\n[Trans.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Nine\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR a time I was utterly at a loss to think of any way of getting\r\nthat money.  Then, the other day, in the light of intense\r\nexcitement, suddenly the whole picture stood out clear before me.\r\n\r\nEvery year my husband makes a reverence-offering of six thousand\r\nrupees to my sister-in-law at the time of the Durga Puja.  Every\r\nyear it is deposited in her account at the bank in Calcutta.\r\nThis year the offering was made as usual, but it has not yet been\r\nsent to the bank, being kept meanwhile in an iron safe, in a\r\ncorner of the little dressing-room attached to our bedroom.\r\n\r\nEvery year my husband takes the money to the bank himself.  This\r\nyear he has not yet had an opportunity of going to town.  How\r\ncould I fail to see the hand of Providence in this?  The money\r\nhas been held up because the country wants it--who could have the\r\npower to take it away from her to the bank?  And how can I have\r\nthe power to refuse to take the money?  The goddess revelling in\r\ndestruction holds out her blood-cup crying: \"Give me drink.  I am\r\nthirsty.\"  I will give her my own heart's blood with that five\r\nthousand rupees.  Mother, the loser of that money will scarcely\r\nfeel the loss, but me you will utterly ruin!\r\n\r\nMany a time, in the old days, have I inwardly called the Senior\r\nRani a thief, for I charged her with wheedling money out of my\r\ntrusting husband.  After her husband's death, she often used to\r\nmake away with things belonging to the estate for her own use.\r\nThis I used to point out to my husband, but he remained silent.\r\nI would get angry and say: \"If you feel generous, make gifts by\r\nall means, but why allow yourself to be robbed?\"  Providence must\r\nhave smiled, then, at these complaints of mine, for tonight I am\r\non the way to rob my husband's safe of my sister-in-law's money.\r\nMy husband's custom was to let his keys remain in his pockets\r\nwhen he took off his clothes for the night, leaving them in the\r\ndressing-room.  I picked out the key of the safe and opened it.\r\nThe slight sound it made seemed to wake the whole world!  A\r\nsudden chill turned my hands and feet icy cold, and I shivered\r\nall over.\r\n\r\nThere was a drawer inside the safe.  On opening this I found the\r\nmoney, not in currency notes, but in gold rolled up in paper.  I\r\nhad no time to count out what I wanted.  There were twenty rolls,\r\nall of which I took and tied up in a corner of my __sari__.\r\n\r\nWhat a weight it was.  The burden of the theft crushed my heart\r\nto the dust.  Perhaps notes would have made it seem less like\r\nthieving, but this was all gold.\r\n\r\nAfter I had stolen into my room like a thief, it felt like my own\r\nroom no longer.  All the most precious rights which I had over it\r\nvanished at the touch of my theft.  I began to mutter to myself,\r\nas though telling __mantrams: Bande Mataram, Bande Mataram__,\r\nmy Country, my golden Country, all this gold is for you, for none\r\nelse!\r\n\r\nBut in the night the mind is weak.  I came back into the bedroom\r\nwhere my husband was asleep, closing my eyes as I passed through,\r\nand went off to the open terrace beyond, on which I lay prone,\r\nclasping to my breast the end of the __sari__ tied over the\r\ngold.  And each one of the rolls gave me a shock of pain.\r\n\r\nThe silent night stood there with forefinger upraised.  I could\r\nnot think of my house as separate from my country: I had robbed\r\nmy house, I had robbed my country.  For this sin my house had\r\nceased to be mine, my country also was estranged from me.  Had I\r\ndied begging for my country, even unsuccessfully, that would have\r\nbeen worship, acceptable to the gods.  But theft is never\r\nworship--how then can I offer this gold?  Ah me!  I am doomed to\r\ndeath myself, must I desecrate my country with my impious touch?\r\nThe way to put the money back is closed to me.  I have not\r\nthe strength to return to the room, take again that key, open\r\nonce more that safe--I should swoon on the threshold of my\r\nhusband's door.  The only road left now is the road in front.\r\nNeither have I the strength deliberately to sit down and count\r\nthe coins.  Let them remain behind their coverings: I cannot\r\ncalculate.\r\n\r\nThere was no mist in the winter sky.  The stars were shining\r\nbrightly.  If, thought I to myself, as I lay out there, I had to\r\nsteal these stars one by one, like golden coins, for my country--\r\nthese stars so carefully stored up in the bosom of the darkness--\r\nthen the sky would be blinded, the night widowed for ever, and my\r\ntheft would rob the whole world.  But was not also this very\r\nthing I had done a robbing of the whole world--not only of money,\r\nbut of trust, of righteousness?\r\n\r\nI spent the night lying on the terrace.  When at last it was\r\nmorning, and I was sure that my husband had risen and left the\r\nroom, then only with my shawl pulled over my head, could I\r\nretrace my steps towards the bedroom.\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law was about, with her brass pot, watering her\r\nplants.  When she saw me passing in the distance she cried: \"Have\r\nyou heard the news, Chota Rani?\"\r\n\r\nI stopped in silence, all in a tremor.  It seemed to me that the\r\nrolls of sovereigns were bulging through the shawl.  I feared\r\nthey would burst and scatter in a ringing shower, exposing to all\r\nthe servants of the house the thief who had made herself\r\ndestitute by robbing her own wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Your band of robbers,\" she went on, \"have sent an anonymous\r\nmessage threatening to loot the treasury.\"\r\n\r\nI remained as silent as a thief.\r\n\r\n\"I was advising Brother Nikhil to seek your protection,\" she\r\ncontinued banteringly.  \"Call off your minions, Robber Queen!  We\r\nwill offer sacrifices to your __Bande Mataram__ if you will\r\nbut save us.  What doings there are these days!--but for the\r\nLord's sake, spare our house at least from burglary.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened into my room without reply.  I had put my foot on\r\nquicksand, and could not now withdraw it.  Struggling would only\r\nsend me down deeper.\r\n\r\nIf only the time would arrive when I could hand over the money to\r\nSandip!  I could bear it no longer, its weight was breaking\r\nthrough my very ribs.\r\n\r\nIt was still early when I got word that Sandip was awaiting me.\r\nToday I had no thought of adornment.  Wrapped as I was in my\r\nshawl, I went off to the outer apartments.  As I entered the\r\nsitting-room I saw Sandip and Amulya there, together.  All my\r\ndignity, all my honour, seemed to run tingling through my body\r\nfrom head to foot and vanish into the ground.  I should have to\r\nlay bare a woman's uttermost shame in sight of this boy!  Could\r\nthey have been discussing my deed in their meeting place?  Had\r\nany vestige of a veil of decency been left for me?\r\n\r\nWe women shall never understand men.  When they are bent on\r\nmaking a road for some achievement, they think nothing of\r\nbreaking the heart of the world into pieces to pave it for the\r\nprogress of their chariot.  When they are mad with the\r\nintoxication of creating, they rejoice in destroying the creation\r\nof the Creator.  This heart-breaking shame of mine will not\r\nattract even a glance from their eyes.  They have no feeling for\r\nlife itself--all their eagerness is for their object.  What am I\r\nto them but a meadow flower in the path of a torrent in flood?\r\n\r\nWhat good will this extinction of me be to Sandip?  Only five\r\nthousand rupees?  Was not I good for something more than only\r\nfive thousand rupees?  Yes, indeed!  Did I not learn that from\r\nSandip himself, and was I not able in the light of this knowledge\r\nto despise all else in my world?  I was the giver of light, of\r\nlife, of __Shakti__, of immortality--in that belief, in that\r\njoy, I had burst all my bounds and come into the open.  Had\r\nanyone then fulfilled for me that joy, I should have lived in my\r\ndeath.  I should have lost nothing in the loss of my all.\r\nDo they want to tell me now that all this was false?  The psalm\r\nof my praise which was sung so devotedly, did it bring me down\r\nfrom my heaven, not to make heaven of earth, but only to level\r\nheaven itself with the dust?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The money, Queen?\"  said Sandip with his keen glance full on my\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAmulya also fixed his gaze on me.  Though not my own mother's\r\nchild, yet the dear lad is brother to me; for mother is mother\r\nall the world over.  With his guileless face, his gentle eyes,\r\nhis innocent youth, he looked at me.  And I, a woman--of his\r\nmother's sex--how could I hand him poison, just because he asked\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\n\"The money, Queen!\"  Sandip's insolent demand rang in my ears.\r\nFor very shame and vexation I felt I wanted to fling that gold at\r\nSandip's head.  I could hardly undo the knot of my __sari__,\r\nmy fingers trembled so.  At last the paper rolls dropped on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nSandip's face grew black ...  He must have thought that the rolls\r\nwere of silver ...  What contempt was in his looks.  What utter\r\ndisgust at incapacity.  It was almost as if he could have struck\r\nme!  He must have suspected that I had come to parley with him,\r\nto offer to compound his claim for five thousand rupees with a\r\nfew hundreds.  There was a moment when I thought he would snatch\r\nup the rolls and throw them out of the window, declaring that he\r\nwas no beggar, but a king claiming tribute.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"  asked Amulya with such pity welling up in his\r\nvoice that I wanted to sob out aloud.  I kept my heart tightly\r\npressed down, and merely nodded my head.  Sandip was speechless.\r\nHe neither touched the rolls, nor uttered a sound.\r\n\r\nMy humiliation went straight to the boy's heart.  With a sudden,\r\nfeigned enthusiasm he exclaimed: \"It's plenty.  It will do\r\nsplendidly.  You have saved us.\"  With which he tore open the\r\ncovering of one of the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns shone out.  And in a moment the black covering\r\nseemed to be lifted from Sandip's countenance also.  His delight\r\nbeamed forth from his features.  Unable to control his sudden\r\nrevulsion of feeling, he sprang up from his seat towards me.\r\nWhat he intended I know not.  I flashed a lightning glance\r\ntowards Amulya--the colour had left the boy's face as at the\r\nstroke of a whip.  Then with all my strength I thrust Sandip from\r\nme.  As he reeled back his head struck the edge of the marble\r\ntable and he dropped on the floor.  There he lay awhile,\r\nmotionless.  Exhausted with my effort, I sank back on my seat.\r\n\r\nAmulya's face lightened with a joyful radiance.  He did not even\r\nturn towards Sandip, but came straight up, took the dust of my\r\nfeet, and then remained there, sitting on the floor in front of\r\nme.  O my little brother, my child!  This reverence of yours is\r\nthe last touch of heaven left in my empty world!  I could contain\r\nmyself no longer, and my tears flowed fast.  I covered my eyes\r\nwith the end of my __sari__, which I pressed to my face with\r\nboth my hands, and sobbed and sobbed.  And every time that I felt\r\non my feet his tender touch trying to comfort me my tears broke\r\nout afresh.\r\n\r\nAfter a little, when I had recovered myself and taken my hands\r\nfrom my face, I saw Sandip back at the table, gathering up the\r\nsovereigns in his handkerchief, as if nothing had happened.\r\nAmulya rose to his seat, from his place near my feet, his wet\r\neyes shining.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandip coolly looked up at my face as he remarked: \"It is six\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do we want with so much, Sandip Babu?\"  cried Amulya.\r\n\"Three thousand five hundred is all we need for our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our wants are not for this one place only,\" Sandip replied.  \"We\r\nshall want all we can get.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" said Amulya.  \"But in future I undertake to get\r\nyou all you want.  Out of this, Sandip Babu, please return the\r\nextra two thousand five hundred to the Maharani.\"\r\n\r\nSandip glanced enquiringly at me.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.  \"I shall never touch that money again.\r\nDo with it as you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can man ever give as woman can?\"  said Sandip, looking towards\r\nAmulya.\r\n\r\n\"They are goddesses!\"  agreed Amulya with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"We men can at best give of our power,\" continued Sandip.  \"But\r\nwomen give themselves.  Out of their own life they give birth,\r\nout of their own life they give sustenance.  Such gifts are the\r\nonly true gifts.\"  Then turning to me, \"Queen!\"  said he, \"if\r\nwhat you have given us had been only money I would not have\r\ntouched it.  But you have given that which is more to you than\r\nlife itself!\"\r\n\r\nThere must be two different persons inside men.  One of these in\r\nme can understand that Sandip is trying to delude me; the other\r\nis content to be deluded.  Sandip has power, but no strength of\r\nrighteousness.  The weapon of his which rouses up life smites it\r\nagain to death.  He has the unfailing quiver of the gods, but the\r\nshafts in them are of the demons.\r\n\r\nSandip's handkerchief was not large enough to hold all the coins.\r\n\"Queen,\" he asked, \"can you give me another?\"  When I gave him\r\nmine, he reverently touched his forehead with it, and then\r\nsuddenly kneeling on the floor he made me an obeisance.\r\n\"Goddess!\"  he said, \"it was to offer my reverence that I had\r\napproached you, but you repulsed me, and rolled me in the dust.\r\nBe it so, I accept your repulse as your boon to me, I raise it to\r\nmy head in salutation!\"  with which he pointed to the place where\r\nhe had been hurt.\r\n\r\nHad I then misunderstood him?  Could it be that his outstretched\r\nhands had really been directed towards my feet?  Yet, surely,\r\neven Amulya had seen the passion that flamed out of his eyes, his\r\nface.  But Sandip is such an adept in setting music to his chant\r\nof praise that I cannot argue; I lose my power of seeing truth;\r\nmy sight is clouded over like an opium-eater's eyes.  And so,\r\nafter all, he gave me back twice as much in return for the blow I\r\nhad dealt him--the wound on his head ended by making me bleed at\r\nheart.  When I had received Sandip's obeisance my theft seemed to\r\ngain a dignity, and the gold glittering on the table to smile\r\naway all fear of disgrace, all stings of conscience.\r\n\r\nLike me Amulya also was won back.  His devotion to Sandip, which\r\nhad suffered a momentary check, blazed up anew.  The flower-vase\r\nof his mind filled once more with offerings for the worship of\r\nSandip and me.  His simple faith shone out of his eyes with the\r\npure light of the morning star at dawn.\r\n\r\nAfter I had offered worship and received worship my sin became\r\nradiant.  And as Amulya looked on my face he raised his folded\r\nhands in salutation and cried __Bande Mataram__!  I cannot\r\nexpect to have this adoration surrounding me for ever; and yet\r\nthis has come to be the only means of keeping alive my self-\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nI can no longer enter my bedroom.  The bedstead seems to thrust\r\nout a forbidding hand, the iron safe frowns at me.  I want to get\r\naway from this continual insult to myself which is rankling\r\nwithin me.  I want to keep running to Sandip to hear him sing my\r\npraises.  There is just this one little altar of worship which\r\nhas kept its head above the all-pervading depths of my dishonour,\r\nand so I want to cleave to it night and day; for on whichever\r\nside I step away from it, there is only emptiness.\r\n\r\nPraise, praise, I want unceasing praise.  I cannot live if my\r\nwine-cup be left empty for a single moment.  So, as the very\r\nprice of my life, I want Sandip of all the world, today.\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my husband nowadays comes in for his meals I feel I cannot\r\nsit before him; and yet it is such a shame not to be near him\r\nthat I feel I cannot do that either.  So I seat myself where we\r\ncannot look at each other's face.  That was how I was sitting the\r\nother day when the Bara Rani came and joined us.\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well for you, brother,\" said she, \"to laugh away\r\nthese threatening letters.  But they do frighten me so.  Have you\r\nsent off that money you gave me to the Calcutta bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not yet had the time to get it away,\" my husband\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"You are so careless, brother dear, you had better look out...\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is in the iron safe right inside the inner dressing-\r\nroom,\" said my husband with a reassuring smile.\r\n\r\n\"What if they get in there?  You can never tell!\"\r\n\r\n\"If they go so far, they might as well carry you off too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you fear, no one will come for poor me.  The real\r\nattraction is in your room!  But joking apart, don't run the risk\r\nof keeping money in the room like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be taking along the Government revenue to Calcutta in\r\na few days now; I will send this money to the bank under the same\r\nescort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.  But see you don't forget all about it, you are so\r\nabsent-minded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if that money gets lost, while in my room, the loss cannot\r\nbe yours, Sister Rani.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, brother, you will make me very angry if you talk in\r\nthat way.  Was I making any difference between yours and mine?\r\nWhat if your money is lost, does not that hurt me?  If Providence\r\nhas thought fit to take away my all, it has not left me\r\ninsensible to the value of the most devoted brother known since\r\nthe days of Lakshman.\"  [25]\r\n\r\n\"Well, Junior Rani, are you turned into a wooden doll?  You have\r\nnot spoken a word yet.  Do you know, brother, our Junior Rani\r\nthinks I try to flatter you.  If things came to that pass I\r\nshould not hesitate to do so, but I know my dear old brother does\r\nnot need it!\"\r\n\r\nThus the Senior Rani chattered on, not forgetting now and then to\r\ndraw her brother's attention to this or that special delicacy\r\namongst the dishes that were being served.  My head was all the\r\ntime in a whirl.  The crisis was fast coming.  Something must be\r\ndone about replacing that money.  And as I kept asking myself\r\nwhat could be done, and how it was to be done, the unceasing\r\npatter of my sister-in-law's words seemed more and more\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nWhat made it all the worse was, that nothing could escape my\r\nsister-in-law's keen eyes.  Every now and then she was casting\r\nside glances towards me.  What she could read in my face I do not\r\nknow, but to me it seemed that everything was written there only\r\ntoo plainly.\r\n\r\nThen I did an infinitely rash thing.  Affecting an easy, amused\r\nlaugh I said: \"All the Senior Rani's suspicions, I see, are\r\nreserved for me--her fears of thieves and robbers are only a\r\nfeint.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senior Rani smiled mischievously.  \"You are right, sister\r\nmine.  A woman's theft is the most fatal of all thefts.  But how\r\ncan you elude my watchfulness?  Am I a man, that you should\r\nhoodwink me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you fear me so,\" I retorted, \"let me keep in your hands all I\r\nhave, as security.  If I cause you loss, you can then repay\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just listen to her, our simple little Junior Rani!\"  she laughed\r\nback, turning to my husband.  \"Does she not know that there are\r\nlosses which no security can make good, either in this world or\r\nin the next?\"\r\n\r\nMy husband did not join in our exchange of words.  When he had\r\nfinished, he went off to the outer apartments, for nowadays he\r\ndoes not take his mid-day rest in our room.\r\n\r\nAll my more valuable jewels were in deposit in the treasury in\r\ncharge of the cashier.  Still what I kept with me must have been\r\nworth thirty or forty thousand.  I took my jewel-box to the Bara\r\nRani's room and opened it out before her, saying: \"I leave these\r\nwith you, sister.  They will keep you quite safe from all worry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bara Rani made a gesture of mock despair.  \"You positively\r\nastound me, Chota Rani!\"  she said.  \"Do you really suppose I\r\nspend sleepless nights for fear of being robbed by you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What harm if you did have a wholesome fear of me?  Does anybody\r\nknow anybody else in this world?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to teach me a lesson by trusting me?  No, no!  I am\r\nbothered enough to know what to do with my own jewels, without\r\nkeeping watch over yours.  Take them away, there's a dear, so\r\nmany prying servants are about.\"\r\n\r\nI went straight from my sister-in-law's room to the sitting-room\r\noutside, and sent for Amulya.  With him Sandip came along too.  I\r\nwas in a great hurry, and said to Sandip: \"If you don't mind, I\r\nwant to have a word or two with Amulya.  Would you...\"\r\n\r\nSandip smiled a wry smile.  \"So Amulya and I are separate in your\r\neyes?  If you have set about to wean him from me, I must confess\r\nI have no power to retain him.\"\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but stood waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" Sandip went on.  \"Finish your special talk with\r\nAmulya.  But then you must give me a special talk all to myself\r\ntoo, or it will mean a defeat for me.  I can stand everything,\r\nbut not defeat.  My share must always be the lion's share.  This\r\nhas been my constant quarrel with Providence.  I will defeat the\r\nDispenser of my fate, but not take defeat at his hands.\"  With a\r\ncrushing look at Amulya, Sandip walked out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Amulya, my own little brother, you must do one thing for me,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I will stake my life for whatever duty you may lay on me,\r\nsister.\"\r\n\r\nI brought out my jewel-box from the folds of my shawl and placed\r\nit before him.  \"Sell or pawn these,\" I said, \"and get me six\r\nthousand rupees as fast as ever you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Sister Rani,\" said Amulya, touched to the quick.  \"Let\r\nthese jewels be.  I will get you six thousand all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly,\" I said impatiently.  \"There is no time for\r\nany nonsense.  Take this box.  Get away to Calcutta by the night\r\ntrain.  And bring me the money by the day after tomorrow\r\npositively.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya took a diamond necklace out of the box, held it up to the\r\nlight and put it back gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I told him, \"that you will never get the proper price\r\nfor these diamonds, so I am giving you jewels worth about thirty\r\nthousand.  I don't care if they all go, but I must have that six\r\nthousand without fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Sister Rani,\" said Amulya, \"I have had a quarrel\r\nwith Sandip Babu over that six thousand rupees he took from you?\r\nI cannot tell you how ashamed I felt.  But Sandip Babu would have\r\nit that we must give up even our shame for the country.  That may\r\nbe so.  But this is somehow different.  I do not fear to die for\r\nthe country, to kill for the country--that much __Shakti__ has\r\nbeen given me.  But I cannot forget the shame of having taken\r\nmoney from you.  There Sandip Babu is ahead of me.  He has no\r\nregrets or compunctions.  He says we must get rid of the idea\r\nthat the money belongs to the one in whose box it happens to be--\r\nif we cannot, where is the magic of __Bande Mataram__?\"\r\n\r\nAmulya gathered enthusiasm as he talked on.  He always warms up\r\nwhen he has me for a listener.  \"The Gita tells us,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"that no one can kill the soul.  Killing is a mere\r\nword.  So also is the taking away of money.  Whose is the money?\r\nNo one has created it.  No one can take it away with him when he\r\ndeparts this life, for it is no part of his soul.  Today it is\r\nmine, tomorrow my son's, the next day his creditor's.  Since, in\r\nfact, money belongs to no one, why should any blame attach to our\r\npatriots if, instead of leaving it for some worthless son, they\r\ntake it for their own use?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I hear Sandip's words uttered by this boy, I tremble all\r\nover.  Let those who are snake-charmers play with snakes; if harm\r\ncomes to them, they are prepared for it.  But these boys are so\r\ninnocent, all the world is ready with its blessing to protect\r\nthem.  They play with a snake not knowing its nature, and when we\r\nsee them smilingly, trustfully, putting their hands within reach\r\nof its fangs, then we understand how terribly dangerous the snake\r\nis.  Sandip is right when he suspects that though I, for myself,\r\nmay be ready to die at his hands, this boy I shall wean from him\r\nand save.\r\n\r\n\"So the money is wanted for the use of your patriots?\"  I\r\nquestioned with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is!\"  said Amulya proudly.  \"Are they not our\r\nkings?  Poverty takes away from their regal power.  Do you know,\r\nwe always insist on Sandip Babu travelling First Class?  He never\r\nshirks kingly honours--he accepts them not for himself, but for\r\nthe glory of us all.  The greatest weapon of those who rule the\r\nworld, Sandip Babu has told us, is the hypnotism of their\r\ndisplay.  To take the vow of poverty would be for them not merely\r\na penance--it would mean suicide.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Sandip noiselessly entered the room.  I threw my\r\nshawl over the jewel-case with a rapid movement.\r\n\r\n\"The special-talk business not yet over?\"  he asked with a sneer\r\nin his tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we've quite finished,\" said Amulya apologetically.  \"It was\r\nnothing much.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Amulya,\" I said, \"we have not quite finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"So exit Sandip for the second time, I suppose?\"  said Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"If you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as to Sandip's re-entry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not today.  I have no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see!\"  said Sandip as his eyes flashed.  \"No time to waste,\r\nonly for special talks!\"\r\n\r\nJealousy!  Where the strong man shows weakness, there the weaker\r\nsex cannot help beating her drums of victory.  So I repeated\r\nfirmly: \"I really have no time.\"\r\n\r\nSandip went away looking black.  Amulya was greatly perturbed.\r\n\"Sister Rani,\" he pleaded, \"Sandip Babu is annoyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has neither cause nor right to be annoyed,\" I said with some\r\nvehemence.  \"Let me caution you about one thing, Amulya.  Say\r\nnothing to Sandip Babu about the sale of my jewels--on your\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you had better not delay any more.  You must get away by\r\ntonight's train.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya and I left the room together.  As we came out on the\r\nverandah Sandip was standing there.  I could see he was waiting\r\nto waylay Amulya.  To prevent that I had to engage him.  \"What is\r\nit you wanted to tell me, Sandip Babu?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing special to say--mere small talk.  And since you\r\nhave not the time .  .  \"\r\n\r\n\"I can give you just a little.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Amulya had left.  As we entered the room Sandip\r\nasked: \"What was that box Amulya carried away?\"\r\n\r\nThe box had not escaped his eyes.  I remained firm.  \"If I could\r\nhave told you, it would have been made over to him in your\r\npresence!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you think Amulya will not tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not.\"\r\n\r\nSandip could not conceal his anger any longer.  \"You think you\r\nwill gain the mastery over me?\"  he blazed out.  \"That shall\r\nnever be.  Amulya, there, would die a happy death if I deigned to\r\ntrample him under foot.  I will never, so long as I live, allow\r\nyou to bring him to your feet!\"\r\n\r\nOh, the weak!  the weak!  At last Sandip has realized that he is\r\nweak before me!  That is why there is this sudden outburst of\r\nanger.  He has understood that he cannot meet the power that I\r\nwield, with mere strength.  With a glance I can crumble his\r\nstrongest fortifications.  So he must needs resort to bluster.  I\r\nsimply smiled in contemptuous silence.  At last have I come to a\r\nlevel above him.  I must never lose this vantage ground; never\r\ndescend lower again.  Amidst all my degradation this bit of\r\ndignity must remain to me!\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Sandip, after a pause, \"it was your jewel-case.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may guess as you please,\" said I, \"but you will get nothing\r\nout of me.\r\n\r\n\"So you trust Amulya more than you trust me?  Do you know that\r\nthe boy is the shadow of my shadow, the echo of my echo--that he\r\nis nothing if I am not at his side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where he is not your echo, he is himself, Amulya.  And that is\r\nwhere I trust him more than I can trust your echo!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not forget that you are under a promise to render up\r\nall your ornaments to me for the worship of the Divine Mother.\r\nIn fact your offering has already been made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever ornaments the gods leave to me will be offered up to\r\nthe gods.  But how can I offer those which have been stolen away\r\nfrom me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, it is no use your trying to give me the slip in that\r\nfashion.  Now is the time for grim work.  Let that work be\r\nfinished, then you can make a display of your woman's wiles to\r\nyour heart's content--and I will help you in your game.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment I had stolen my husband's money and paid it to Sandip,\r\nthe music that was in our relations stopped.  Not only did I\r\ndestroy all my own value by making myself cheap, but Sandip's\r\npowers, too, lost scope for their full play.  You cannot employ\r\nyour marksmanship against a thing which is right in your grasp.\r\nSo Sandip has lost his aspect of the hero; a tone of low\r\nquarrelsomeness has come into his words.\r\n\r\nSandip kept his brilliant eyes fixed full on my face till they\r\nseemed to blaze with all the thirst of the mid-day sky.  Once or\r\ntwice he fidgeted with his feet, as though to leave his seat, as\r\nif to spring right on me.  My whole body seemed to swim, my veins\r\nthrobbed, the hot blood surged up to my ears; I felt that if I\r\nremained there, I should never get up at all.  With a supreme\r\neffort I tore myself off the chair, and hastened towards the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nFrom Sandip's dry throat there came a muffled cry: \"Whither would\r\nyou flee, Queen?\"  The next moment he left his seat with a bound\r\nto seize hold of me.  At the sound of footsteps outside the door,\r\nhowever, he rapidly retreated and fell back into his chair.  I\r\nchecked my steps near the bookshelf, where I stood staring at the\r\nnames of the books.\r\n\r\nAs my husband entered the room, Sandip exclaimed: \"I say, Nikhil,\r\ndon't you keep Browning among your books here?  I was just\r\ntelling Queen Bee of our college club.  Do you remember that\r\ncontest of ours over the translation of those lines from\r\nBrowning?  You don't?\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"She should never have looked at me,\r\n  If she meant I should not love her,\r\n  There are plenty ...  men you call such,\r\n  I suppose ...  she may discover\r\n  All her soul to, if she pleases,\r\n  And yet leave much as she found them:\r\n  But I'm not so, and she knew it\r\n  When she fixed me, glancing round them.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\"I managed to get together the words to render it into Bengali,\r\nsomehow, but the result was hardly likely to be a 'joy forever'\r\nto the people of Bengal.  I really did think at one time that I\r\nwas on the verge of becoming a poet, but Providence was kind\r\nenough to save me from that disaster.  Do you remember old\r\nDakshina?  If he had not become a Salt Inspector, he would have\r\nbeen a poet.  I remember his rendering to this day ...\r\n\r\n\"No, Queen Bee, it is no use rummaging those bookshelves.  Nikhil\r\nhas ceased to read poetry since his marriage--perhaps he has no\r\nfurther need for it.  But I suppose 'the fever fit of poesy', as\r\nthe Sanskrit has it, is about to attack me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to give you a warning, Sandip,\" said my husband.\r\n\r\n\"About the fever fit of poesy?\"\r\n\r\nMy husband took no notice of this attempt at humour.  \"For some\r\ntime,\" he continued, \"Mahomedan preachers have been about\r\nstirring up the local Mussulmans.  They are all wild with you,\r\nand may attack you any moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you come to advise flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to give you information, not to offer advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had these estates been mine, such a warning would have been\r\nnecessary for the preachers, not for me.  If, instead of trying\r\nto frighten me, you give them a taste of your intimidation, that\r\nwould be worthier both of you and me.  Do you know that your\r\nweakness is weakening your neighbouring __zamindars__ also?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not offer you my advice, Sandip.  I wish you, too, would\r\nrefrain from giving me yours.  Besides, it is useless.  And there\r\nis another thing I want to tell you.  You and your followers have\r\nbeen secretly worrying and oppressing my tenantry.  I cannot\r\nallow that any longer.  So I must ask you to leave my territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"For fear of the Mussulmans, or is there any other fear you have\r\nto threaten me with?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are fears the want of which is cowardice.  In the name of\r\nthose fears, I tell you, Sandip, you must go.  In five days I\r\nshall be starting for Calcutta.  I want you to accompany me.  You\r\nmay of course stay in my house there--to that there is no\r\nobjection.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I have still five day's time then.  Meanwhile, Queen\r\nBee, let me hum to you my song of parting from your honey-hive.\r\nAh!  you poet of modern Bengal!  Throw open your doors and let me\r\nplunder your words.  The theft is really yours, for it is my song\r\nwhich you have made your own--let the name be yours by all means,\r\nbut the song is mine.\"  With this Sandip struck up in a deep,\r\nhusky voice, which threatened to be out of tune, a song in the\r\nBhairavi mode:\r\n\r\n/*\r\n  \"In the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,\r\n  Meetings and partings chase each other in their endless hide\r\n    and seek,\r\n  And flowers blossom in the wake of those that droop and die in\r\n    the shade.\r\n  In the springtime of your kingdom, my Queen,\r\n  My meeting with you had its own songs,\r\n  But has not also my leave-taking any gift to offer you?\r\n  That gift is my secret hope, which I keep hidden in the shadows\r\n    of your flower garden,\r\n  That the rains of July may sweetly temper your fiery June.\"\r\n*/\r\n\r\nHis boldness was immense--boldness which had no veil, but was naked\r\nas fire.  One finds no time to stop it: it is like trying\r\nto resist a thunderbolt: the lightning flashes: it laughs at all\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nI left the room.  As I was passing along the verandah towards the\r\ninner apartments, Amulya suddenly made his appearance and came\r\nand stood before me.\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing, Sister Rani,\" he said.  \"I am off tonight and\r\nshall not return unsuccessful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amulya,\" said I, looking straight into his earnest, youthful\r\nface, \"I fear nothing for myself, but may I never cease to fear\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya turned to go, but before he was out of sight I called him\r\nback and asked: \"Have you a mother, Amulya?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am the only child of my mother.  My father died when I was\r\nquite little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go back to your mother, Amulya.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Sister Rani, I have now both mother and sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Amulya, before you leave tonight, come and have your\r\ndinner here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be time for that.  Let me take some food for the\r\njourney, consecrated with your touch.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you specially like, Amulya?\"\r\n\"If I had been with my mother I should have had lots of Poush\r\ncakes.  Make some for me with your own hands, Sister Rani!\"\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n25. Of the __Ramayana__.  The story of his devotion to his\r\nelder brother Rama and his brother's wife Sita, has become a\r\nbyword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Ten\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI LEARNT from my master that Sandip had joined forces with Harish\r\nKundu, and there was to be a grand celebration of the worship of\r\nthe demon-destroying Goddess.  Harish Kundu was extorting the\r\nexpenses from his tenantry.  Pandits Kaviratna and Vidyavagish\r\nhad been commissioned to compose a hymn with a double meaning.\r\n\r\nMy master has just had a passage at arms with Sandip over this.\r\n\"Evolution is at work amongst the gods as well,\" says Sandip.\r\n\"The grandson has to remodel the gods created by the grandfather\r\nto suit his own taste, or else he is left an atheist.  It is my\r\nmission to modernize the ancient deities.  I am born the saviour\r\nof the gods, to emancipate them from the thraldom of the past.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen from our boyhood what a juggler with ideas is Sandip.\r\nHe has no interest in discovering truth, but to make a quizzical\r\ndisplay of it rejoices his heart.  Had he been born in the wilds\r\nof Africa he would have spent a glorious time inventing argument\r\nafter argument to prove that cannibalism is the best means of\r\npromoting true communion between man and man.  But those who deal\r\nin delusion end by deluding themselves, and I fully believe that,\r\neach time Sandip creates a new fallacy, he persuades himself that\r\nhe has found the truth, however contradictory his creations may\r\nbe to one another.\r\n\r\nHowever, I shall not give a helping hand to establish a liquor\r\ndistillery in my country.  The young men, who are ready to offer\r\ntheir services for their country's cause, must not fall into this\r\nhabit of getting intoxicated.  The people who want to exact work\r\nby drugging methods set more value on the excitement than on the\r\nminds they intoxicate.\r\n\r\nI had to tell Sandip, in Bimala's presence, that he must go.\r\nPerhaps both will impute to me the wrong motive.  But I must free\r\nmyself also from all fear of being misunderstood.  Let even\r\nBimala misunderstand me ...\r\n\r\nA number of Mahomedan preachers are being sent over from Dacca.\r\nThe Mussulmans in my territory had come to have almost as much of\r\nan aversion to the killing of cows as the Hindus.  But now cases\r\nof cow-killing are cropping up here and there.  I had the news\r\nfirst from some of my Mussulman tenants with expressions of their\r\ndisapproval.  Here was a situation which I could see would be\r\ndifficult to meet.  At the bottom was a pretence of fanaticism,\r\nwhich would cease to be a pretence if obstructed.  That is just\r\nwhere the ingenuity of the move came in!\r\n\r\nI sent for some of my principal Hindu tenants and tried to get\r\nthem to see the matter in its proper light.  \"We can be staunch\r\nin our own convictions,\" I said, \"but we have no control over\r\nthose of others.  For all that many of us are Vaishnavas, those\r\nof us who are Shaktas go on with their animal sacrifices just the\r\nsame.  That cannot be helped.  We must, in the same way, let the\r\nMussulmans do as they think best.  So please refrain from all\r\ndisturbance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maharaja,\" they replied, \"these outrages have been unknown for\r\nso long.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was so,\" I said, \"because such was their spontaneous\r\ndesire.  Let us behave in such a way that the same may become\r\ntrue, over again.  But a breach of the peace is not the way to\r\nbring this about.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Maharaja,\" they insisted, \"those good old days are gone.\r\nThis will never stop unless you put it down with a strong hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oppression,\" I replied, \"will not only not prevent cow-killing,\r\nit may lead to the killing of men as well.\"\r\n\r\nOne of them had had an English education.  He had learnt to\r\nrepeat the phrases of the day.  \"It is not only a question of\r\northodoxy,\" he argued.  \"Our country is mainly agricultural, and\r\ncows are ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Buffaloes in this country,\" I interrupted, \"likewise give milk\r\nand are used for ploughing.  And therefore, so long as we dance\r\nfrantic dances on our temple pavements, smeared with their blood,\r\ntheir severed heads carried on our shoulders, religion will only\r\nlaugh at us if we quarrel with Mussulmans in her name, and\r\nnothing but the quarrel itself will remain true.  If the cow\r\nalone is to be held sacred from slaughter, and not the buffalo,\r\nthen that is bigotry, not religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you not aware, sir, of what is behind all this?\"\r\npursued the English-knowing tenant.  \"This has only become\r\npossible because the Mussulman is assured of safety, even if he\r\nbreaks the law.  Have you not heard of the Pachur case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is it possible,\" I asked, \"to use the Mussulmans thus, as\r\ntools against us?  Is it not because we have fashioned them into\r\nsuch with our own intolerance?  That is how Providence punishes\r\nus.  Our accumulated sins are being visited on our own heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, if that be so, let them be visited on us.  But we\r\nshall have our revenge.  We have undermined what was the greatest\r\nstrength of the authorities, their devotion to their own laws.\r\nOnce they were truly kings, dispensing justice; now they\r\nthemselves will become law-breakers, and so no better than\r\nrobbers.  This may not go down to history, but we shall carry it\r\nin our hearts for all time ...\"\r\n\r\nThe evil reports about me which are spreading from paper to paper\r\nare making me notorious.  News comes that my effigy has been\r\nburnt at the river-side burning-ground of the Chakravartis, with\r\ndue ceremony and enthusiasm; and other insults are in\r\ncontemplation.  The trouble was that they had come to ask me to\r\ntake shares in a Cotton Mill they wanted to start.  I had to tell\r\nthem that I did not so much mind the loss of my own money, but I\r\nwould not be a party to causing a loss to so many poor\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n\"Are we to understand, Maharaja,\" said my visitors, \"that the\r\nprosperity of the country does not interest you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Industry may lead to the country's prosperity,\" I explained,\r\n\"but a mere desire for its prosperity will not make for success\r\nin industry.  Even when our heads were cool, our industries did\r\nnot flourish.  Why should we suppose that they will do so just\r\nbecause we have become frantic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not say plainly that you will not risk your money?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will put in my money when I see that it is industry which\r\nprompts you.  But, because you have lighted a fire, it does not\r\nfollow that you have the food to cook over it.\"\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is this?  Our Chakua sub-treasury looted!  A remittance of\r\nseven thousand five hundred rupees was due from there to\r\nheadquarters.  The local cashier had changed the cash at the\r\nGovernment Treasury into small currency notes for convenience in\r\ncarrying, and had kept them ready in bundles.  In the middle of\r\nthe night an armed band had raided the room, and wounded Kasim,\r\nthe man on guard.  The curious part of it was that they had taken\r\nonly six thousand rupees and left the rest scattered on the\r\nfloor, though it would have been as easy to carry that away also.\r\nAnyhow, the raid of the dacoits was over; now the police raid\r\nwould begin.  Peace was out of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen I went inside, I found the news had travelled before me.\r\n\"What a terrible thing, brother,\" exclaimed the Bara Rani.\r\n\"Whatever shall we do?\"\r\n\r\nI made light of the matter to reassure her.  \"We still have\r\nsomething left,\" I said with a smile.  \"We shall manage to get\r\nalong somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't joke about it, brother dear.  Why are they all so angry\r\nwith you?  Can't you humour them?  Why put everybody out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot let the country go to rack and ruin, even if that would\r\nplease everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a shocking thing they did at the burning-grounds.  It's\r\na horrid shame to treat you so.  The Chota Rani has got rid of\r\nall her fears by dint of the Englishwoman's teaching, but as for\r\nme, I had to send for the priest to avert the omen before I could\r\nget any peace of mind.  For my sake, dear, do get away to\r\nCalcutta.  I tremble to think what they may do, if you stay on\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nMy sister-in-law's genuine anxiety touched me deeply.\r\n\r\n\"And, brother,\" she went on, \"did I not warn you, it was not well\r\nto keep so much money in your room?  They might get wind of it\r\nany day.  It is not the money--but who knows...\"\r\n\r\nTo calm her I promised to remove the money to the treasury at\r\nonce, and then get it away to Calcutta with the first escort\r\ngoing.  We went together to my bedroom.  The dressing-room door\r\nwas shut.  When I knocked, Bimala called out: \"I am dressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder at the Chota Rani,\" exclaimed my sister-in-law,\r\n\"dressing so early in the day!  One of their __Bande Mataram__\r\nmeetings, I suppose.  Robber Queen!\"  she called out in jest to\r\nBimala.  \"Are you counting your spoils inside?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will attend to the money a little later,\" I said, as I came\r\naway to my office room outside.\r\n\r\nI found the Police Inspector waiting for me.  \"Any trace of the\r\ndacoits?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have my suspicions.\"\r\n\r\n\"On whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kasim, the guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kasim?  But was he not wounded?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mere nothing.  A flesh wound on the leg.  Probably self-\r\ninflicted.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot bring myself to believe it.  He is such a trusted\r\nservant.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may have trusted him, but that does not prevent his being a\r\nthief.  Have I not seen men trusted for twenty years together,\r\nsuddenly developing...\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if it were so, I could not send him to gaol.  But why\r\nshould he have left the rest of the money lying about?\"\r\n\r\n\"To put us off the scent.  Whatever you may say, Maharaja, he\r\nmust be an old hand at the game.  He mounts guard during his\r\nwatch, right enough, but I feel sure he has a finger in all the\r\ndacoities going on in the neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nWith this the Inspector proceeded to recount the various methods\r\nby which it was possible to be concerned in a dacoity twenty or\r\nthirty miles away, and yet be back in time for duty.\r\n\r\n\"Have you brought Kasim here?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply, \"he is in the lock-up.  The Magistrate is\r\ndue for the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see him,\" I said.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to his cell he fell at my feet, weeping.  \"In God's\r\nname,\" he said, \"I swear I did not do this thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt you, Kasim,\" I assured him.  \"Fear nothing.  They\r\ncan do nothing to you, if you are innocent.\"\r\n\r\nKasim, however, was unable to give a coherent account of the\r\nincident.  He was obviously exaggerating.  Four or five hundred\r\nmen, big guns, numberless swords, figured in his narrative.  It\r\nmust have been either his disturbed state of mind or a desire to\r\naccount for his easy defeat.  He would have it that this was\r\nHarish Kundu's doing; he was even sure he had heard the voice of\r\nEkram, the head retainer of the Kundus.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Kasim,\" I had to warn him, \"don't you be dragging\r\nother people in with your stories.  You are not called upon to\r\nmake out a case against Harish Kundu, or anybody else.\"\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning home I asked my master to come over.  He shook his\r\nhead gravely.  \"I see no good in this,\" said he--\"this setting\r\naside of conscience and putting the country in its place.  All\r\nthe sins of the country will now break out, hideous and\r\nunashamed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who do you think could have ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me.  But sin is rampant.  Send them all away, right\r\naway from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given them one more day.  They will be leaving the day\r\nafter tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And another thing.  Take Bimala away to Calcutta.  She is\r\ngetting too narrow a view of the outside world from here, she\r\ncannot see men and things in their true proportions.  Let her see\r\nthe world--men and their work--give her abroad vision.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I was thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't make any delay about it.  I tell you, Nikhil, man's\r\nhistory has to be built by the united effort of all the races in\r\nthe world, and therefore this selling of conscience for political\r\nreasons--this making a fetish of one's country, won't do.  I know\r\nthat Europe does not at heart admit this, but there she has not\r\nthe right to pose as our teacher.  Men who die for the truth\r\nbecome immortal: and, if a whole people can die for the truth, it\r\nwill also achieve immortality in the history of humanity.  Here,\r\nin this land of India, amid the mocking laughter of Satan\r\npiercing the sky, may the feeling for this truth become real!\r\nWhat a terrible epidemic of sin has been brought into our country\r\nfrom foreign lands...\"\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed in the turmoil of investigation.  I was\r\ntired out when I retired for the night.  I left over sending my\r\nsister-in-law's money to the treasury till next morning.\r\n\r\nI woke up from my sleep at dead of night.  The room was dark.  I\r\nthought I heard a moaning somewhere.  Somebody must have been\r\ncrying.  Sounds of sobbing came heavy with tears like fitful\r\ngusts of wind in the rainy night.  It seemed to me that the cry\r\nrose from the heart of my room itself.  I was alone.  For some\r\ndays Bimala had her bed in another room adjoining mine.  I rose\r\nup and when I went out I found her in the balcony lying prone\r\nupon her face on the bare floor.\r\n\r\nThis is something that cannot be written in words.  He only knows\r\nit who sits in the bosom of the world and receives all its pangs\r\nin His own heart.  The sky is dumb, the stars are mute, the night\r\nis still, and in the midst of it all that one sleepless cry!\r\n\r\nWe give these sufferings names, bad or good, according to the\r\nclassifications of the books, but this agony which is welling up\r\nfrom a torn heart, pouring into the fathomless dark, has it any\r\nname?  When in that midnight, standing under the silent stars, I\r\nlooked upon that figure, my mind was struck with awe, and I said\r\nto myself: \"Who am Ito judge her?\"  O life, O death, O God of the\r\ninfinite existence, I bow my head in silence to the mystery which\r\nis in you.\r\n\r\nOnce I thought I should turn back.  But I could not.  I sat down\r\non the ground near Bimala and placed my hand on her head.  At the\r\nfirst touch her whole body seemed to stiffen, but the next moment\r\nthe hardness gave way, and the tears burst out.  I gently passed\r\nmy fingers over her forehead.  Suddenly her hands groping for my\r\nfeet grasped them and drew them to herself, pressing them against\r\nher breast with such force that I thought her heart would break.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmulya is due to return from Calcutta this morning.  I told the\r\nservants to let me know as soon as he arrived, but could not keep\r\nstill.  At last I went outside to await him in the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nWhen I sent him off to sell the jewels I must have been thinking\r\nonly of myself.  It never even crossed my mind that so young a\r\nboy, trying to sell such valuable jewellery, would at once be\r\nsuspected.  So helpless are we women, we needs must place on\r\nothers the burden of our danger.  When we go to our death we drag\r\ndown those who are about us.\r\n\r\nI had said with pride that I would save Amulya--as if she who was\r\ndrowning could save others.  But instead of saving him, I have\r\nsent him to his doom.  My little brother, such a sister have I\r\nbeen to you that Death must have smiled on that Brothers' Day\r\nwhen I gave you my blessing--I, who wander distracted with the\r\nburden of my own evil-doing.\r\n\r\nI feel today that man is at times attacked with evil as with the\r\nplague.  Some germ finds its way in from somewhere, and then in\r\nthe space of one night Death stalks in.  Why cannot the stricken\r\none be kept far away from the rest of the world?  I, at least,\r\nhave realized how terrible is the contagion--like a fiery torch\r\nwhich burns that it may set the world on fire.\r\n\r\nIt struck nine.  I could not get rid of the idea that Amulya was\r\nin trouble, that he had fallen into the clutches of the police.\r\nThere must be great excitement in the Police Office--whose are\r\nthe jewels?--where did he get them?  And in the end I shall have\r\nto furnish the answer, in public, before all the world.\r\n\r\nWhat is that answer to be?  Your day has come at last, Bara Rani,\r\nyou whom I have so long despised.  You, in the shape of the\r\npublic, the world, will have your revenge.  O God, save me this\r\ntime, and I will cast all my pride at my sister-in-law's feet.\r\n\r\nI could bear it no longer.  I went straight to the Bara Rani.\r\nShe was in the verandah, spicing her betel leaves, Thako at her\r\nside.  The sight of Thako made me shrink back for a moment, but I\r\novercame all hesitation, and making a low obeisance I took the\r\ndust of my elder sister-in-law's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my soul, Chota Rani,\" she exclaimed, \"what has come upon\r\nyou?  Why this sudden reverence?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my birthday, sister,\" said I.  \"I have caused you pain.\r\nGive me your blessing today that I may never do so again.  My\r\nmind is so small.\"  I repeated my obeisance and left her\r\nhurriedly, but she called me back.\r\n\r\n\"You never before told me that this was your birthday, Chotie\r\ndarling!  Be sure to come and have lunch with me this afternoon.\r\nYou positively must.\"\r\n\r\nO God, let it really be my birthday today.  Can I not be born\r\nover again?  Cleanse me, my God, and purify me and give me one\r\nmore trial!\r\n\r\nI went again to the sitting-room to find Sandip there.  A feeling\r\nof disgust seemed to poison my very blood.  The face of his,\r\nwhich I saw in the morning light, had nothing of the magic\r\nradiance of genius.\r\n\r\n\"Will you leave the room,\" I blurted out.\r\n\r\nSandip smiled.  \"Since Amulya is not here,\" he remarked, \"I\r\nshould think my turn had come for a special talk.\"\r\n\r\nMy fate was coming back upon me.  How was Ito take away the right\r\nI myself had given.  \"I would be alone,\" I repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Queen,\" he said, \"the presence of another person does not\r\nprevent your being alone.  Do not mistake me for one of the\r\ncrowd.  I, Sandip, am always alone, even when surrounded by\r\nthousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please come some other time.  This morning I am ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Waiting for Amulya?\"\r\n\r\nI turned to leave the room for sheer vexation, when Sandip drew\r\nout from the folds of his cloak that jewel-casket of mine and\r\nbanged it down on the marble table.  I was thoroughly startled.\r\n\"Has not Amulya gone, then?\"  I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Gone where?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Calcutta?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" chuckled Sandip.\r\n\r\nAh, then my blessing had come true, in spite of all.  He was\r\nsaved.  Let God's punishment fall on me, the thief, if only\r\nAmulya be safe.\r\n\r\nThe change in my countenance roused Sandip's scorn.  \"So pleased,\r\nQueen!\"  sneered he.  \"Are these jewels so very precious?  How\r\nthen did you bring yourself to offer them to the Goddess?  Your\r\ngift was actually made.  Would you now take it back?\"\r\n\r\nPride dies hard and raises its fangs to the last.  It was clear\r\nto me I must show Sandip I did not care a rap about these jewels.\r\n\"If they have excited your greed,\" I said, \"you may have them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My greed today embraces the wealth of all Bengal,\" replied\r\nSandip.  \"Is there a greater force than greed?  It is the steed\r\nof the great ones of the earth, as is the elephant, Airauat, the\r\nsteed of Indra.  So then these jewels are mine?\"\r\n\r\nAs Sandip took up and replaced the casket under his cloak, Amulya\r\nrushed in.  There were dark rings under his eyes, his lips were\r\ndry, his hair tumbled: the freshness of his youth seemed to have\r\nwithered in a single day.  Pangs gripped my heart as I looked on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"My box!\"  he cried, as he went straight up to Sandip without a\r\nglance at me.  \"Have you taken that jewel-box from my trunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your jewel-box?\"  mocked Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"It was my trunk!\"\r\nSandip burst out into a laugh.  \"Your distinctions between mine\r\nand yours are getting rather thin, Amulya,\" he cried.  \"You will\r\ndie a religious preacher yet, I see.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya sank on a chair with his face in his hands.  I went up to\r\nhim and placing my hand on his head asked him: \"What is your\r\ntrouble, Amulya?\"\r\n\r\nHe stood straight up as he replied: \"I had set my heart, Sister\r\nRani, on returning your jewels to you with my own hand.  Sandip\r\nBabu knew this, but he forestalled me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I care for my jewels?\"  I said.  \"Let them go.  No harm\r\nis done.\r\n\r\n\"Go?  Where?\"  asked the mystified boy.\r\n\r\n\"The jewels are mine,\" said Sandip.  \"Insignia bestowed on me by\r\nmy Queen!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" broke out Amulya wildly.  \"Never, Sister Rani!  I\r\nbrought them back for you.  You shall not give them away to\r\nanybody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your gift, my little brother,\" said I.  \"But let him,\r\nwho hankers after them, satisfy his greed.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya glared at Sandip like a beast of prey, as he growled:\r\n\"Look here, Sandip Babu, you know that even hanging has no\r\nterrors for me.  If you dare take away that box of jewels ...\"\r\n\r\nWith an attempt at a sarcastic laugh Sandip said: \"You also ought\r\nto know by this time, Amulya, that I am not the man to be afraid\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Queen Bee,\" he went on, turning to me, \"I did not come here\r\ntoday to take these jewels, I came to give them to you.  You\r\nwould have done wrong to take my gift at Amulya's hands.  In\r\norder to prevent it, I had first to make them clearly mine.  Now\r\nthese my jewels are my gift to you.  Here they are!  Patch up any\r\nunderstanding with this boy you like.  I must go.  You have been\r\nat your special talks all these days together, leaving me out of\r\nthem.  If special happenings now come to pass, don't blame me.\r\n\r\n\"Amulya,\" he continued, \"I have sent on your trunks and things to\r\nyour lodgings.  Don't you be keeping any belongings of yours in\r\nmy room any longer.\"  With this parting shot, Sandip flung out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have had no peace of mind, Amulya,\" I said to him, \"ever since\r\nI sent you off to sell my jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sister Rani?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid lest you should get into trouble with them, lest\r\nthey should suspect you for a thief.  I would rather go without\r\nthat six thousand.  You must now do another thing for me--go home\r\nat once, home to your mother.\"\r\n\r\nAmulya produced a small bundle and said: \"But, sister, I have got\r\nthe six thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where from?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tried hard to get gold,\" he went on, without replying to my\r\nquestion, \"but could not.  So I had to bring it in notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me truly, Amulya, swear by me, where did you get this\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will not tell you.\"\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to grow dark before my eyes.  \"What terrible\r\nthing have you done, Amulya?\"  I cried.  \"Is it then ...\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you will say I got this money wrongly.  Very well, I\r\nadmit it.  But I have paid the full price for my wrong-doing.  So\r\nnow the money is mine.\"\r\n\r\nI no longer had any desire to learn more about it.  My very\r\nblood-vessels contracted, making my whole body shrink within\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Take it away, Amulya,\" I implored.  \"Put it back where you got\r\nit from.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be hard indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not hard, brother dear.  It was an evil moment when you\r\nfirst came to me.  Even Sandip has not been able to harm you as I\r\nhave done.\"\r\n\r\nSandip's name seemed to stab him.\r\n\r\n\"Sandip!\"  he cried.  \"It was you alone who made me come to know\r\nthat man for what he is.  Do you know, sister, he has not spent a\r\npice out of those sovereigns he took from you?  He shut himself\r\ninto his room, after he left you, and gloated over the gold,\r\npouring it out in a heap on the floor.  'This is not money,' he\r\nexclaimed, 'but the petals of the divine lotus of power;\r\ncrystallized strains of music from the pipes that play in the\r\nparadise of wealth!  I cannot find it in my heart to change them,\r\nfor they seem longing to fulfil their destiny of adorning the\r\nneck of Beauty.  Amulya, my boy, don't you look at these with\r\nyour fleshly eye, they are Lakshmi's smile, the gracious radiance\r\nof Indra's queen.  No, no, I can't give them up to that boor of a\r\nmanager.  I am sure, Amulya, he was telling us lies.  The police\r\nhaven't traced the man who sank that boat.  It's the manager who\r\nwants to make something out of it.  We must get those letters\r\nback from him.'\r\n\r\n\"I asked him how we were to do this; he told me to use force or\r\nthreats.  I offered to do so if he would return the gold.  That,\r\nhe said, we could consider later.  I will not trouble you,\r\nsister, with all I did to frighten the man into giving up those\r\nletters and burn them--it is a long story.  That very night I\r\ncame to Sandip and said: 'We are now safe.  Let me have the\r\nsovereigns to return them tomorrow to my sister, the Maharani.'\r\nBut he cried, 'What infatuation is this of yours?  Your precious\r\nsister's skirt bids fair to hide the whole country from you.  Say\r\n__Bande Mataram__ and exorcize the evil spirit.'\r\n\r\n\"You know, Sister Rani, the power of Sandip's magic.  The gold\r\nremained with him.  And I spent the whole dark night on the\r\nbathing-steps of the lake muttering __Bande Mataram__.\r\n\r\n\"Then when you gave me your jewels to sell, I went again to\r\nSandip.  I could see he was angry with me.  But he tried not to\r\nshow it.  'If I still have them hoarded up in any box of mine you\r\nmay take them,' said he, as he flung me his keys.  They were\r\nnowhere to be seen.  'Tell me where they are,' I said.  'I will\r\ndo so,' he replied, 'when I find your infatuation has left you.\r\nNot now.'\r\n\r\n\"When I found I could not move him, I had to employ other\r\nmethods.  Then I tried to get the sovereigns from him in exchange\r\nfor my currency notes for six thousand rupees.  'You shall have\r\nthem,' he said, and disappeared into his bedroom, leaving me\r\nwaiting outside.  There he broke open my trunk and came straight\r\nto you with your casket through some other passage.  He would not\r\nlet me bring it, and now he dares call it his gift.  How can I\r\ntell how much he has deprived me of?  I shall never forgive him.\r\n\r\n\"But, oh sister, his power over me has been utterly broken.  And\r\nit is you who have broken it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother dear,\" said I, \"if that is so, then my life is\r\njustified.  But more remains to be done, Amulya.  It is not\r\nenough that the spell has been destroyed.  Its stains must be\r\nwashed away.  Don't delay any longer, go at once and put back the\r\nmoney where you took it from.  Can you not do it, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"With your blessing everything is possible, Sister Rani.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember, it will not be your expiation alone, but mine also.  I\r\nam a woman; the outside world is closed to me, else I would have\r\ngone myself.  My hardest punishment is that I must put on you the\r\nburden of my sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that, sister.  The path I was treading was not your\r\npath.  It attracted me because of its dangers and difficulties.\r\nNow that your path calls me, let it be a thousand times more\r\ndifficult and dangerous, the dust of your feet will help me to\r\nwin through.  Is it then your command that this money be\r\nreplaced?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not my command, brother mine, but a command from above.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that I know nothing.  It is enough for me that this command\r\nfrom above comes from your lips.  And, sister, I thought I had an\r\ninvitation here.  I must not lose that.  You must give me your\r\n__prasad__ [26] before I go.  Then, if I can possibly manage\r\nit, I will finish my duty in the evening.\"\r\n\r\nTears came to my eyes when I tried to smile as I said: \"So be\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n26. Food consecrated by the touch of a revered person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Eleven\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH Amulya's departure my heart sank within me.  On what\r\nperilous adventure had I sent this only son of his mother?  O\r\nGod, why need my expiation have such pomp and circumstance?\r\nCould I not be allowed to suffer alone without inviting all this\r\nmultitude to share my punishment?  Oh, let not this innocent\r\nchild fall victim to Your wrath.\r\n\r\nI called him back--\"Amulya!\"\r\n\r\nMy voice sounded so feebly, it failed to reach him.\r\n\r\nI went up to the door and called again: \"Amulya!\"\r\n\r\nHe had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rani Mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and tell Amulya Babu that I want him.\"\r\n\r\nWhat exactly happened I could not make out--the man, perhaps, was\r\nnot familiar with Amulya's name--but he returned almost at once\r\nfollowed by Sandip.\r\n\r\n\"The very moment you sent me away,\" he said as he came in, \"I had\r\na presentiment that you would call me back.  The attraction of\r\nthe same moon causes both ebb and flow.  I was so sure of being\r\nsent for, that I was actually waiting out in the passage.  As\r\nsoon as I caught sight of your man, coming from your room, I\r\nsaid: 'Yes, yes, I am coming, I am coming at once!'--before he\r\ncould utter a word.  That up-country lout was surprised, I can\r\ntell you!  He stared at me, open-mouthed, as if he thought I knew\r\nmagic.\r\n\r\n\"All the fights in the world, Queen Bee,\" Sandip rambled on, \"are\r\nreally fights between hypnotic forces.  Spell cast against spell\r\n--noiseless weapons which reach even invisible targets.  At last I\r\nhave met in you my match.  Your quiver is full, I know, you\r\nartful warrior Queen!  You are the only one in the world who has\r\nbeen able to turn Sandip out and call Sandip back, at your sweet\r\nwill.  Well, your quarry is at your feet.  What will you do with\r\nhim now?  Will you give him the coup de grâce, or keep him in\r\nyour cage?  Let me warn you beforehand, Queen, you will find the\r\nbeast as difficult to kill outright as to keep in bondage.\r\nAnyway, why lose time in trying your magic weapons?\"\r\n\r\nSandip must have felt the shadow of approaching defeat, and this\r\nmade him try to gain time by chattering away without waiting for\r\na reply.  I believe he knew that I had sent the messenger for\r\nAmulya, whose name the man must have mentioned.  In spite of that\r\nhe had deliberately played this trick.  He was now trying to\r\navoid giving me any opening to tell him that it was Amulya I\r\nwanted, not him.  But his stratagem was futile, for I could see\r\nhis weakness through it.  I must not yield up a pin's point of\r\nthe ground I had gained.\r\n\r\n\"Sandip Babu,\" I said, \"I wonder how you can go on making these\r\nendless speeches, without a stop.  Do you get them up by heart,\r\nbeforehand?\"\r\n\r\nSandip's face flushed instantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" I continued, \"that our professional reciters keep\r\na book full of all kinds of ready-made discourses, which can be\r\nfitted into any subject.  Have you also a book?\"\r\n\r\nSandip ground out his reply through his teeth.  \"God has given\r\nyou women a plentiful supply of coquetry to start with, and on\r\nthe top of that you have the milliner and the jeweller to help\r\nyou; but do not think we men are so helpless ...\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better go back and look up your book, Sandip Babu.  You\r\nare getting your words all wrong.  That's just the trouble with\r\ntrying to repeat things by rote.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\"  shouted Sandip, losing all control over himself.  \"You to\r\ninsult me thus!  What is there left of you that I do not know to\r\nthe very bottom?  What ...\"  He became speechless.\r\n\r\nSandip, the wielder of magic spells, is reduced to utter\r\npowerlessness, whenever his spell refuses to work.  From a king\r\nhe fell to the level of a boor.  Oh, the joy of witnessing his\r\nweakness!  The harsher he became in his rudeness, the more did\r\nthis joy well up within me.  His snaky coils, with which he used\r\nto snare me, are exhausted--I am free.  I am saved, saved.  Be\r\nrude to me, insult me, for that shows you in your truth; but\r\nspare me your songs of praise, which were false.\r\n\r\nMy husband came in at this juncture.  Sandip had not the\r\nelasticity to recover himself in a moment, as he used to do\r\nbefore.  My husband looked at him for a while in surprise.  Had\r\nthis happened some days ago I should have felt ashamed.  But\r\ntoday I was pleased--whatever my husband might think.  I wanted\r\nto have it out to the finish with my weakening adversary.\r\n\r\nFinding us both silent and constrained, my husband hesitated a\r\nlittle, and then took a chair.  \"Sandip,\" he said, \"I have been\r\nlooking for you, and was told you were here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here,\" said Sandip with some emphasis.  \"Queen Bee sent for\r\nme early this morning.  And I, the humble worker of the hive,\r\nleft all else to attend her summons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to Calcutta tomorrow.  You will come with me.\r\n\r\n\"And why, pray?  Do you take me for one of your retinue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well, take it that you are going to Calcutta, and that\r\nI am your follower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no business there.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the more reason for going.  You have too much business\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't propose to stir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I propose to shift you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forcibly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forcibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I will make a move.  But the world is not\r\ndivided between Calcutta and your estates.  There are other\r\nplaces on the map.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the way you have been going on, one would hardly have\r\nthought that there was any other place in the world except my\r\nestates.\"\r\n\r\nSandip stood up.  \"It does happen at times,\" he said, \"that a\r\nman's whole world is reduced to a single spot.  I have realized\r\nmy universe in this sitting-room of yours, that is why I have\r\nbeen a fixture here.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to me.  \"None but you, Queen Bee,\" he said, \"will\r\nunderstand my words--perhaps not even you.  I salute you.  With\r\nworship in my heart I leave you.  My watchword has changed since\r\nyou have come across my vision.  It is no longer __Bande\r\nMataram__ (Hail Mother), but Hail Beloved, Hail Enchantress.\r\nThe mother protects, the mistress leads to destruction--but sweet\r\nis that destruction.  You have made the anklet sounds of the\r\ndance of death tinkle in my heart.  You have changed for me, your\r\ndevotee, the picture I had of this Bengal of ours--'the soft\r\nbreeze-cooled land of pure water and sweet fruit.' [27] You have\r\nno pity, my beloved.  You have come to me with your poison cup\r\nand I shall drain it, either to die in agony or live triumphing\r\nover death.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he continued.  \"The mother's day is past.  O love, my\r\nlove, you have made as naught for me the truth and right and\r\nheaven itself.  All duties have become as shadows: all rules and\r\nrestraints have snapped their bonds.  O love, my love, I could\r\nset fire to all the world outside this land on which you have set\r\nyour dainty feet, and dance in mad revel over the ashes ...\r\nThese are mild men.  These are good men.  They would do good to\r\nall--as if this all were a reality!  No, no!  There is no reality\r\nin the world save this one real love of mine.  I do you\r\nreverence.  My devotion to you has made me cruel; my worship of\r\nyou has lighted the raging flame of destruction within me.  I am\r\nnot righteous.  I have no beliefs, I only believe in her whom,\r\nabove all else in the world, I have been able to realize.\"\r\n\r\nWonderful!  It was wonderful, indeed.  Only a minute ago I had\r\ndespised this man with all my heart.  But what I had thought to\r\nbe dead ashes now glowed with living fire.  The fire in him is\r\ntrue, that is beyond doubt.  Oh why has God made man such a mixed\r\ncreature?  Was it only to show his supernatural sleight of hand?\r\nOnly a few minutes ago I had thought that Sandip, whom I had once\r\ntaken to be a hero, was only the stage hero of melodrama.  But\r\nthat is not so, not so.  Even behind the trappings of the\r\ntheatre, a true hero may sometimes be lurking.\r\n\r\nThere is much in Sandip that is coarse, that is sensuous, that is\r\nfalse, much that is overlaid with layer after layer of fleshly\r\ncovering.  Yet--yet it is best to confess that there is a great\r\ndeal in the depths of him which we do not, cannot understand--\r\nmuch in ourselves too.  A wonderful thing is man.  What great\r\nmysterious purpose he is working out only the Terrible One [28]\r\nknows--meanwhile we groan under the brunt of it.  Shiva is the\r\nLord of Chaos.  He is all Joy.  He will destroy our bonds.\r\n\r\nI cannot but feel, again and again, that there are two persons in\r\nme.  One recoils from Sandip in his terrible aspect of Chaos--the\r\nother feels that very vision to be sweetly alluring.  The sinking\r\nship drags down all who are swimming round it.  Sandip is just\r\nsuch a force of destruction.  His immense attraction gets hold of\r\none before fear can come to the rescue, and then, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, one is drawn away, irresistibly, from all\r\nlight, all good, all freedom of the sky, all air that can be\r\nbreathed--from lifelong accumulations, from everyday cares--right\r\nto the bottom of dissolution.\r\n\r\nFrom some realm of calamity has Sandip come as its messenger; and\r\nas he stalks the land, muttering unholy incantations, to him\r\nflock all the boys and youths.  The mother, seated in the lotus-\r\nheart of the Country, is wailing her heart out; for they have\r\nbroken open her store-room, there to hold their drunken revelry.\r\nHer vintage of the draught for the immortals they would pour out\r\non the dust; her time-honoured vessels they would smash to\r\npieces.  True, I feel with her; but, at the same time, I cannot\r\nhelp being infected with their excitement.\r\n\r\nTruth itself has sent us this temptation to test our trustiness\r\nin upholding its commandments.  Intoxication masquerades in\r\nheavenly garb, and dances before the pilgrims saying: \"Fools you\r\nare that pursue the fruitless path of renunciation.  Its way is\r\nlong, its time passing slow.  So the Wielder of the Thunderbolt\r\nhas sent me to you.  Behold, I the beautiful, the passionate, I\r\nwill accept you--in my embrace you shall find fulfilment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a pause Sandip addressed me again: \"Goddess, the time has\r\ncome for me to leave you.  It is well.  The work of your nearness\r\nhas been done.  By lingering longer it would only become undone\r\nagain, little by little.  All is lost, if in our greed we try to\r\ncheapen that which is the greatest thing on earth.  That which is\r\neternal within the moment only becomes shallow if spread out in\r\ntime.  We were about to spoil our infinite moment, when it was\r\nyour uplifted thunderbolt which came to the rescue.  You\r\nintervened to save the purity of your own worship--and in so\r\ndoing you also saved your worshipper.  In my leave-taking today\r\nyour worship stands out the biggest thing.  Goddess, I, also, set\r\nyou free today.  My earthen temple could hold you no longer--\r\nevery moment it was on the point of breaking apart.  Today I\r\ndepart to worship your larger image in a larger temple.  I can\r\ngain you more truly only at a distance from yourself.  Here I had\r\nonly your favour, there I shall be vouchsafed your boon.\"\r\n\r\nMy jewel-casket was lying on the table.  I held it up aloft as I\r\nsaid: \"I charge you to convey these my jewels to the object of my\r\nworship--to whom I have dedicated them through you.\"\r\n\r\nMy husband remained silent.  Sandip left the room.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n27. Quotation from the National song--__Bande Mataram__.\r\n\r\n28. Rudra, the Terrible, a name of Shiva.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had just sat down to make some cakes for Amulya when the Bara\r\nRani came upon the scene.  \"Oh dear,\" she exclaimed, \"has it come\r\nto this that you must make cakes for your own birthday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no one else for whom I could be making them?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not the day when you should think of feasting\r\nothers.  It is for us to feast you.  I was just thinking of\r\nmaking something up [29] when I heard the staggering news which\r\ncompletely upset me.  A gang of five or six hundred men, they\r\nsay, has raided one of our treasuries and made off with six\r\nthousand rupees.  Our house will be looted next, they expect.\"\r\n\r\nI felt greatly relieved.  So it was our own money after all.  I\r\nwanted to send for Amulya at once and tell him that he need only\r\nhand over those notes to my husband and leave the explanations to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"You are a wonderful creature!\"  my sister-in-law broke out, at\r\nthe change in my countenance.  \"Have you then really no such\r\nthing as fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe it,\" I said.  \"Why should they loot our house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not believe it, indeed!  Who could have believed that they would\r\nattack our treasury, either?\"\r\n\r\nI made no reply, but bent over my cakes, putting in the cocoa-nut\r\nstuffing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm off,\" said the Bara Rani after a prolonged stare at\r\nme.  \"I must see Brother Nikhil and get something done about\r\nsending off my money to Calcutta, before it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nShe was no sooner gone than I left the cakes to take care of\r\nthemselves and rushed to my dressing-room, shutting myself\r\ninside.  My husband's tunic with the keys in its pocket was still\r\nhanging there--so forgetful was he.  I took the key of the iron\r\nsafe off the ring and kept it by me, hidden in the folds of my\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nThen there came a knocking at the door.  \"I am dressing,\" I\r\ncalled out.  I could hear the Bara Rani saying: \"Only a minute\r\nago I saw her making cakes and now she is busy dressing up.  What\r\nnext, I wonder!  One of their __Bande Mataram__ meetings is\r\non, I suppose.  I say, Robber Queen,\" she called out to me, \"are\r\nyou taking stock of your loot?\"\r\n\r\nWhen they went away I hardly know what made me open the safe.\r\nPerhaps there was a lurking hope that it might all be a dream.\r\nWhat if, on pulling out the inside drawer, I should find the\r\nrolls of gold there, just as before?  ...  Alas, everything was\r\nempty as the trust which had been betrayed.\r\n\r\nI had to go through the farce of dressing.  I had to do my hair\r\nup all over again, quite unnecessarily.  When I came out my\r\nsister-in-law railed at me: \"How many times are you going to\r\ndress today?\"\r\n\r\n\"My birthday!\"  I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, any pretext seems good enough,\" she went on.  \"Many vain\r\npeople have I seen in my day, but you beat them all hollow.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to summon a servant to send after Amulya, when one of\r\nthe men came up with a little note, which he handed to me.  It\r\nwas from Amulya.  \"Sister,\" he wrote, \"you invited me this\r\nafternoon, but I thought I should not wait.  Let me first execute\r\nyour bidding and then come for my __prasad__.  I may be a\r\nlittle late.\"\r\n\r\nTo whom could he be going to return that money?  into what fresh\r\nentanglement was the poor boy rushing?  O miserable woman, you\r\ncan only send him off like an arrow, but not recall him if you\r\nmiss your aim.\r\n\r\nI should have declared at once that I was at the bottom of this\r\nrobbery.  But women live on the trust of their surroundings--this\r\nis their whole world.  If once it is out that this trust has been\r\nsecretly betrayed, their place in their world is lost.  They have\r\nthen to stand upon the fragments of the thing they have broken,\r\nand its jagged edges keep on wounding them at every turn.  To sin\r\nis easy enough, but to make up for it is above all difficult for\r\na woman.\r\n\r\nFor some time past all easy approaches for communion with my\r\nhusband have been closed to me.  How then could I burst on him\r\nwith this stupendous news?  He was very late in coming for his\r\nmeal today--nearly two o'clock.  He was absent-minded and hardly\r\ntouched any food.  I had lost even the right to press him to take\r\na little more.  I had to avert my face to wipe away my tears.\r\n\r\nI wanted so badly to say to him: \"Do come into our room and rest\r\nawhile; you look so tired.\"  I had just cleared my throat with a\r\nlittle cough, when a servant hurried in to say that the Police\r\nInspector had brought Panchu up to the palace.  My husband, with\r\nthe shadow on his face deepened, left his meal unfinished and\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\nA little later the Bara Rani appeared.  \"Why did you not send me\r\nword when Brother Nikhil came in?\"  she complained.  \"As he was\r\nlate I thought I might as well finish my bath in the meantime.\r\nHowever did he manage to get through his meal so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, did you want him for anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this about both of you going off to Calcutta tomorrow?\r\nAll I can say is, I am not going to be left here alone.  I should\r\nget startled out of my life at every sound, with all these\r\ndacoits about.  Is it quite settled about your going tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, though I had only just now heard it; and though,\r\nmoreover, I was not at all sure that before tomorrow our history\r\nmight not take such a turn as to make it all one whether we went\r\nor stayed.  After that, what our home, our life would be like,\r\nwas utterly beyond my ken--it seemed so misty and phantom-like.\r\n\r\nIn a very few hours now my unseen fate would become visible.  Was\r\nthere no one who could keep on postponing the flight of these\r\nhours, from day to day, and so make them long enough for me to\r\nset things right, so far as lay in my power?  The time during\r\nwhich the seed lies underground is long--so long indeed that one\r\nforgets that there is any danger of its sprouting.  But once its\r\nshoot shows up above the surface, it grows and grows so fast,\r\nthere is no time to cover it up, neither with skirt, nor body,\r\nnor even life itself.\r\n\r\nI will try to think of it no more, but sit quiet--passive and\r\ncallous--let the crash come when it may.  By the day after\r\ntomorrow all will be over--publicity, laughter, bewailing,\r\nquestions, explanations--everything.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot forget the face of Amulya--beautiful, radiant with\r\ndevotion.  He did not wait, despairing, for the blow of fate to\r\nfall, but rushed into the thick of danger.  In my misery I do him\r\nreverence.  He is my boy-god.  Under the pretext of his\r\nplayfulness he took from me the weight of my burden.  He would\r\nsave me by taking the punishment meant for me on his own head.\r\nBut how am Ito bear this terrible mercy of my God?\r\n\r\nOh, my child, my child, I do you reverence.  Little brother mine,\r\nI do you reverence.  Pure are you, beautiful are you, I do you\r\nreverence.  May you come to my arms, in the next birth, as my own\r\nchild--that is my prayer.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n29. Any dainties to be offered ceremonially should be made by the\r\nlady of the house herself.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRumour became busy on every side.  The police were continually in\r\nand out.  The servants of the house were in a great flurry.\r\n\r\nKhema, my maid, came up to me and said: \"Oh, Rani Mother! for\r\ngoodness\" sake put away my gold necklace and armlets in your iron\r\nsafe.\"  To whom was I to explain that the Rani herself had been\r\nweaving all this network of trouble, and had got caught in it,\r\ntoo?  I had to play the benign protector and take charge of\r\nKhema's ornaments and Thako's savings.  The milk-woman, in her\r\nturn, brought along and kept in my room a box in which were a\r\nBenares __sari__ and some other of her valued possessions.  \"I\r\ngot these at your wedding,\" she told me.\r\n\r\nWhen, tomorrow, my iron safe will be opened in the presence of\r\nthese--Khema, Thako, the milk-woman and all the rest ...  Let me\r\nnot think of it!  Let me rather try to think what it will be like\r\nwhen this third day of Magh comes round again after a year has\r\npassed.  Will all the wounds of my home life then be still as\r\nfresh as ever?  ...\r\n\r\nAmulya writes that he will come later in the evening.  I cannot\r\nremain alone with my thoughts, doing nothing.  So I sit down\r\nagain to make cakes for him.  I have finished making quite a\r\nquantity, but still I must go on.  Who will eat them?  I shall\r\ndistribute them amongst the servants.  I must do so this very\r\nnight.  Tonight is my limit.  Tomorrow will not be in my hands.\r\n\r\nI went on untiringly, frying cake after cake.  Every now and then\r\nit seemed to me that there was some noise in the direction of my\r\nrooms, upstairs.  Could it be that my husband had missed the key\r\nof the safe, and the Bara Rani had assembled all the servants to\r\nhelp him to hunt for it?  No, I must not pay heed to these\r\nsounds.  Let me shut the door.\r\n\r\nI rose to do so, when Thako came panting in: \"Rani Mother, oh,\r\nRani Mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh get away!\"  I snapped out, cutting her short.  \"Don't come\r\nbothering me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bara Rani Mother wants you,\" she went on.  \"Her nephew has\r\nbrought such a wonderful machine from Calcutta.  It talks like a\r\nman.  Do come and hear it!\"\r\n\r\nI did not know whether to laugh or to cry.  So, of all things, a\r\ngramophone needs must come on the scene at such a time, repeating\r\nat every winding the nasal twang of its theatrical songs!  What a\r\nfearsome thing results when a machine apes a man.\r\n\r\nThe shades of evening began to fall.  I knew that Amulya would\r\nnot delay to announce himself--yet I could not wait.  I summone\r\nd a servant and said: \"Go and tell Amulya Babu to come straight\r\nin here.\"  The man came back after a while to say that Amulya was\r\nnot in--he had not come back since he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\"  The last word struck my ears like a wail in the\r\ngathering darkness.  Amulya gone!  Had he then come like a streak\r\nof light from the setting sun, only to be gone for ever?  All\r\nkinds of possible and impossible dangers flitted through my mind.\r\nIt was I who had sent him to his death.  What if he was fearless?\r\nThat only showed his own greatness of heart.  But after this how\r\nwas Ito go on living all by myself?\r\n\r\nI had no memento of Amulya save that pistol--his reverence-\r\noffering.  It seemed to me that this was a sign given by\r\nProvidence.  This guilt which had contaminated my life at its\r\nvery root--my God in the form of a child had left with me the\r\nmeans of wiping it away, and then vanished.  Oh the loving gift--\r\nthe saving grave that lay hidden within it!\r\n\r\nI opened my box and took out the pistol, lifting it reverently to\r\nmy forehead.  At that moment the gongs clanged out from the\r\ntemple attached to our house.  I prostrated myself in salutation.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I feasted the whole household with my cakes.  \"You\r\nhave managed a wonderful birthday feast--and all by yourself\r\ntoo!\"  exclaimed my sister-in-law.  \"But you must leave something\r\nfor us to do.\"  With this she turned on her gramophone and let\r\nloose the shrill treble of the Calcutta actresses all over the\r\nplace.  It seemed like a stable full of neighing fillies.\r\n\r\nIt got quite late before the feasting was over.  I had a sudden\r\nlonging to end my birthday celebration by taking the dust of my\r\nhusband's feet.  I went up to the bedroom and found him fast\r\nasleep.  He had had such a worrying, trying day.  I raised the\r\nedge of the mosquito curtain very very gently, and laid my head\r\nnear his feet.  My hair must have touched him, for he moved his\r\nlegs in his sleep and pushed my head away.\r\n\r\nI then went out and sat in the west verandah.  A silk-cotton\r\ntree, which had shed all its leaves, stood there in the distance,\r\nlike a skeleton.  Behind it the crescent moon was setting.  All\r\nof a sudden I had the feeling that the very stars in the sky were\r\nafraid of me--that the whole of the night world was looking\r\naskance at me.  Why?  Because I was alone.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so strange in creation as the man who is alone.\r\nEven he whose near ones have all died, one by one, is not alone--\r\ncompanionship comes for him from behind the screen of death.  But\r\nhe, whose kin are there, yet no longer near, who has dropped out\r\nof all the varied companionship of a full home--the starry\r\nuniverse itself seems to bristle to look on him in his darkness.\r\n\r\nWhere I am, I am not.  I am far away from those who are around\r\nme.  I live and move upon a world-wide chasm of separation,\r\nunstable as the dew-drop upon the lotus leaf.\r\n\r\nWhy do not men change wholly when they change?  When I look into\r\nmy heart, I find everything that was there, still there--only\r\nthey are topsy-turvy.  Things that were well-ordered have become\r\njumbled up.  The gems that were strung into a necklace are now\r\nrolling in the dust.  And so my heart is breaking.\r\n\r\nI feel I want to die.  Yet in my heart everything still lives--\r\nnor even in death can I see the end of it all: rather, in death\r\nthere seems to be ever so much more of repining.  What is to be\r\nended must be ended in this life--there is no other way out.\r\n\r\nOh forgive me just once, only this time, Lord!  All that you gave\r\ninto my hands as the wealth of my life, I have made into my\r\nburden.  I can neither bear it longer, nor give it up.  O Lord,\r\nsound once again those flute strains which you played for me,\r\nlong ago, standing at the rosy edge of my morning sky--and let\r\nall my complexities become simple and easy.  Nothing save the\r\nmusic of your flute can make whole that which has been broken,\r\nand pure that which has been sullied.  Create my home anew with\r\nyour music.  No other way can I see.\r\n\r\nI threw myself prone on the ground and sobbed aloud.  It was for\r\nmercy that I prayed--some little mercy from somewhere, some\r\nshelter, some sign of forgiveness, some hope that might bring\r\nabout the end.  \"Lord,\" I vowed to myself, \"I will lie here,\r\nwaiting and waiting, touching neither food nor drink, so long as\r\nyour blessing does not reach me.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the sound of footsteps.  Who says that the gods do not\r\nshow themselves to mortal men?  I did not raise my face to look\r\nup, lest the sight of it should break the spell.  Come, oh come,\r\ncome and let your feet touch my head.  Come, Lord, and set your\r\nfoot upon my throbbing heart, and at that moment let me die.\r\n\r\nHe came and sat near my head.  Who?  My husband!  At the first\r\ntouch of his presence I felt that I should swoon.  And then the\r\npain at my heart burst its way out in an overwhelming flood of\r\ntears, tearing through all my obstructing veins and nerves.  I\r\nstrained his feet to my bosom--oh, why could not their impress\r\nremain there for ever?\r\n\r\nHe tenderly stroked my head.  I received his blessing.  Now I\r\nshall be able to take up the penalty of public humiliation which\r\nwill be mine tomorrow, and offer it, in all sincerity, at the\r\nfeet of my God.\r\n\r\nBut what keeps crushing my heart is the thought that the festive\r\nflutes which were played at my wedding, nine years ago, welcoming\r\nme to this house, will never sound for me again in this life.\r\nWhat rigour of penance is there which can serve to bring me once\r\nmore, as a bride adorned for her husband, to my place upon that\r\nsame bridal seat?  How many years, how many ages, aeons, must\r\npass before I can find my way back to that day of nine years ago?\r\n\r\nGod can create new things, but has even He the power to create\r\nafresh that which has been destroyed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter Twelve\r\n\r\nNikhil's Story\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTODAY we are going to Calcutta.  Our joys and sorrows lie heavy\r\non us if we merely go on accumulating them.  Keeping them and\r\naccumulating them alike are false.  As master of the house I am\r\nin an artificial position--in reality I am a wayfarer on the path\r\nof life.  That is why the true Master of the House gets hurt at\r\nevery step and at last there comes the supreme hurt of death.\r\n\r\nMy union with you, my love, was only of the wayside; it was well\r\nenough so long as we followed the same road; it will only hamper\r\nus if we try to preserve it further.  We are now leaving its\r\nbonds behind.  We are started on our journey beyond, and it will\r\nbe enough if we can throw each other a glance, or feel the touch\r\nof each other's hands in passing.  After that?  After that there\r\nis the larger world-path, the endless current of universal life.\r\n\r\nHow little can you deprive me of, my love, after all?  Whenever I\r\nset my ear to it, I can hear the flute which is playing, its\r\nfountain of melody gushing forth from the flute-stops of\r\nseparation.  The immortal draught of the goddess is never\r\nexhausted.  She sometimes breaks the bowl from which we drink it,\r\nonly to smile at seeing us so disconsolate over the trifling\r\nloss.  I will not stop to pick up my broken bowl.  I will march\r\nforward, albeit with unsatisfied heart.\r\n\r\nThe Bara Rani came and asked me: \"What is the meaning, brother,\r\nof all these books being packed up and sent off in box-loads?\"\r\n\r\n\"It only means,\" I replied, \"that I have not yet been able to get\r\nover my fondness for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish you would keep your fondness for some other things\r\nas well!  Do you mean you are never coming back home?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be coming and going, but shall not immure myself here\r\nany more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh indeed!  Then just come along to my room and see how many\r\nthings __I__ have been unable to shake off __my__ fondness\r\nfor.\"  With this she took me by the hand and marched me off.\r\n\r\nIn my sister-in-law's rooms I found numberless boxes and bundles\r\nready packed.  She opened one of the boxes and said: \"See,\r\nbrother, look at all my __pan__-making things.  In this bottle\r\nI have catechu powder scented with the pollen of screw-pine\r\nblossoms.  These little tin boxes are all for different kinds of\r\nspices.  I have not forgotten my playing cards and draught-board\r\neither.  If you two are over-busy, I shall manage to make other\r\nfriends there, who will give me a game.  Do you remember this\r\ncomb?  It was one of the __Swadeshi__ combs you brought for\r\nme...\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is all this for, Sister Rani?  Why have you been\r\npacking up all these things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I am not going with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What an extraordinary idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be afraid!  I am not going there to flirt with you,\r\nnor to quarrel with the Chota Rani!  One must die sooner or\r\nlater, and it is just as well to be on the bank of the holy\r\nGanges before it is too late.  It is too horrible to think of\r\nbeing cremated in your wretched burning-ground here, under that\r\nstumpy banian tree--that is why I have been refusing to die, and\r\nhave plagued you all this time.\"\r\n\r\nAt last I could hear the true voice of home.  The Bara Rani came\r\ninto our house as its bride, when I was only six years old.  We\r\nhave played together, through the drowsy afternoons, in a corner\r\nof the roof-terrace.  I have thrown down to her green amras from\r\nthe tree-top, to be made into deliciously indigestible chutnies\r\nby slicing them up with mustard, salt and fragrant herbs.  It was\r\nmy part to gather for her all the forbidden things from the\r\nstore-room to be used in the marriage celebration of her doll;\r\nfor, in the penal code of my grandmother, I alone was exempt from\r\npunishment.  And I used to be appointed her messenger to my\r\nbrother, whenever she wanted to coax something special out of\r\nhim, because he could not resist my importunity.  I also remember\r\nhow, when I suffered under the rigorous régime of the doctors of\r\nthose days--who would not allow anything except warm water and\r\nsugared cardamom seeds during feverish attacks--my sister-in-law\r\ncould not bear my privation and used to bring me delicacies on\r\nthe sly.  What a scolding she got one day when she was caught!\r\n\r\nAnd then, as we grew up, our mutual joys and sorrows took on\r\ndeeper tones of intimacy.  How we quarrelled!  Sometimes\r\nconflicts of worldly interests roused suspicions and jealousies,\r\nmaking breaches in our love; and when the Chota Rani came in\r\nbetween us, these breaches seemed as if they would never be\r\nmended, but it always turned out that the healing forces at\r\nbottom proved more powerful than the wounds on the surface.\r\n\r\nSo has a true relationship grown up between us, from our\r\nchildhood up till now, and its branching foliage has spread and\r\nbroadened over every room and verandah and terrace of this great\r\nhouse.  When I saw the Bara Rani make ready, with all her\r\nbelongings, to depart from this house of ours, all the ties that\r\nbound us, to their wide-spreading ends, felt the shock.\r\n\r\nThe reason was clear to me, why she had made up her mind to drift\r\naway towards the unknown, cutting asunder all her lifelong bonds\r\nof daily habit, and of the house itself, which she had never left\r\nfor a day since she first entered it at the age of nine.  And yet\r\nit was this real reason which she could not allow to escape her\r\nlips, preferring rather to put forward any other paltry excuse.\r\n\r\nShe had only this one relationship left in all the world, and the\r\npoor, unfortunate, widowed and childless woman had cherished it\r\nwith all the tenderness hoarded in her heart.  How deeply she had\r\nfelt our proposed separation I never realized so keenly as when I\r\nstood amongst her scattered boxes and bundles.\r\n\r\nI could see at once that the little differences she used to have\r\nwith Bimala, about money matters, did not proceed from any sordid\r\nworldliness, but because she felt that her claims in regard to\r\nthis one relationship of her life had been overridden and its\r\nties weakened for her by the coming in between of this other\r\nwoman from goodness knows where!  She had been hurt at every turn\r\nand yet had not the right to complain.\r\n\r\nAnd Bimala?  She also had felt that the Senior Rani's claim over\r\nme was not based merely on our social connection, but went much\r\ndeeper; and she was jealous of these ties between us, reaching\r\nback to our childhood.\r\n\r\nToday my heart knocked heavily against the doors of my breast.  I\r\nsank down upon one of the boxes as I said: \"How I should love,\r\nSister Rani, to go back to the days when we first met in this old\r\nhouse of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, brother dear,\" she replied with a sigh, \"I would not live my\r\nlife again--not as a woman!  Let what I have had to bear end with\r\nthis one birth.  I could not bear it over again.\"\r\n\r\nI said to her: \"The freedom to which we pass through sorrow is\r\ngreater than the sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be so for you men.  Freedom is for you.  But we women\r\nwould keep others bound.  We would rather be put into bondage\r\nourselves.  No, no, brother, you will never get free from our\r\ntoils.  If you needs must spread your wings, you will have to\r\ntake us with you; we refuse to be left behind.  That is why I\r\nhave gathered together all this weight of luggage.  It would\r\nnever do to allow men to run too light.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can feel the weight of your words,\" I said laughing, \"and if\r\nwe men do not complain of your burdens, it is because women pay\r\nus so handsomely for what they make us carry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You carry it,\" she said, \"because it is made up of many small\r\nthings.  Whichever one you think of rejecting pleads that it is\r\nso light.  And so with much lightness we weigh you down ...  When\r\ndo we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"The train leaves at half past eleven tonight.  There will be\r\nlots of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, do be good for once and listen to just one word of\r\nmine.  Take a good nap this afternoon.  You know you never get\r\nany sleep in the train.  You look so pulled down, you might go to\r\npieces any moment.  Come along, get through your bath first.\"\r\n\r\nAs we went towards my room, Khema, the maid, came up and with an\r\nultra-modest pull at her veil told us, in deprecatingly low\r\ntones, that the Police Inspector had arrived with a prisoner and\r\nwanted to see the Maharaja.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Maharaja a thief, or a robber,\" the Bara Rani flared up,\r\n\"that he should be set upon so by the police?  Go and tell the\r\nInspector that the Maharaja is at his bath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me just go and see what is the matter,\" I pleaded.  \"It may\r\nbe something urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" my sister-in-law insisted.  \"Our Chota Rani was making\r\na heap of cakes last night.  I'll send some to the Inspector, to\r\nkeep him quiet till you're ready.\"  With this she pushed me into\r\nmy room and shut the door on me.\r\n\r\nI had not the power to resist such tyranny--so rare is it in this\r\nworld.  Let the Inspector while away the time eating cakes.  What\r\nif business is a bit neglected?\r\n\r\nThe police had been in great form these last few days arresting\r\nnow this one, now that.  Each day some innocent person or other\r\nwould be brought along to enliven the assembly in my office-room.\r\nOne more such unfortunate, I supposed, must have been brought in\r\nthat day.  But why should the Inspector alone be regaled with\r\ncakes?  That would not do at all.  I thumped vigorously on the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"If you are going mad, be quick and pour some water over your\r\nhead--that will keep you cool,\" said my sister-in-law from the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\"Send down cakes for two,\" I shouted.  \"The person who has been\r\nbrought in as the thief probably deserves them better.  Tell the\r\nman to give him a good big helping.\"\r\n\r\nI hurried through my bath.  When I came out, I found Bimal\r\nsitting on the floor outside.  [30] Could this be my Bimal of\r\nold, my proud, sensitive Bimal?\r\n\r\nWhat favour could she be wanting to beg, seated like this at my\r\ndoor?\r\n\r\nAs I stopped short, she stood up and said gently with downcast\r\neyes: \"I would have a word with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come inside then,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"But are you going out on any particular business?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, but let that be.  I want to hear ...\"\r\n\r\n\"No, finish your business first.  We will have our talk after you\r\nhave had your dinner.\"\r\n\r\nI went off to my sitting-room, to find the Police Inspector's\r\nplate quite empty.  The person he had brought with him, however,\r\nwas still busy eating.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\"  I ejaculated in surprise.  \"You, Amulya?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I, sir,\" said Amulya with his mouth full of cake.  \"I've\r\nhad quite a feast.  And if you don't mind, I'll take the rest\r\nwith me.\"  With this he proceeded to tie up the remaining cakes\r\nin his handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\"  I asked, staring at the Inspector.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed.  \"We are no nearer, sir,\" he said, \"to solving\r\nthe problem of the thief: meanwhile the mystery of the theft\r\ndeepens.\"  He then produced something tied up in a rag, which\r\nwhen untied disclosed a bundle of currency notes.  \"This,\r\nMaharaja,\" said the Inspector, \"is your six thousand rupees!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was it found?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Amulya Babu's hands.  He went last evening to the manager of\r\nyour Chakna sub-office to tell him that the money had been found.\r\nThe manager seemed to be in a greater state of trepidation at the\r\nrecovery than he had been at the robbery.  He was afraid he would\r\nbe suspected of having made away with the notes and of now making\r\nup a cock-and-bull story for fear of being found out.  He asked\r\nAmulya to wait, on the pretext of getting him some refreshment,\r\nand came straight over to the Police Office.  I rode off at once,\r\nkept Amulya with me, and have been busy with him the whole\r\nmorning.  He refuses to tell us where he got the money from.  I\r\nwarned him he would be kept under restraint till he did so.  In\r\nthat case, he informed me he would have to lie.  Very well, I\r\nsaid, he might do so if he pleased.  Then he stated that he had\r\nfound the money under a bush.  I pointed out to him that it was\r\nnot quite so easy to lie as all that.  Under what bush?  Where\r\nwas the place?  Why was he there?--All this would have to be\r\nstated as well.  'Don't you worry,' he said, 'there is plenty of\r\ntime to invent all that.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Inspector,\" I said, \"why are you badgering a respectable\r\nyoung gentleman like Amulya Babu?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to harass him,\" said the Inspector.  \"He is not\r\nonly a gentleman, but the son of Nibaran Babu, my school-fellow.\r\nLet me tell you, Maharaja, exactly what must have happened.\r\nAmulya knows the thief, but wants to shield him by drawing\r\nsuspicion on himself.  That is just the sort of bravado he loves\r\nto indulge in.\"  The Inspector turned to Amulya.  \"Look here,\r\nyoung man,\" he continued, \"I also was eighteen once upon a time,\r\nand a student in the Ripon College.  I nearly got into gaol\r\ntrying to rescue a hack driver from a police constable.  It was a\r\nnear shave.\"  Then he turned again to me and said: \"Maharaja, the\r\nreal thief will now probably escape, but I think I can tell you\r\nwho is at the bottom of it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is it, then?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The manager, in collusion with the guard, Kasim.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Inspector, having argued out his theory to his own\r\nsatisfaction, at last departed, I said to Amulya: \"If you will\r\ntell me who took the money, I promise you no one shall be hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But how can that be?  What about the gang of armed men?...\"\r\n\r\n\"It was I, by myself, alone!\"\r\n\r\nWhat Amulya then told me was indeed extraordinary.  The manager\r\nhad just finished his supper and was on the verandah rinsing out\r\nhis mouth.  The place was somewhat dark.  Amulya had a revolver\r\nin each pocket, one loaded with blank cartridges, the other with\r\nball.  He had a mask over his face.  He flashed a bull's-eye\r\nlantern in the manager's face and fired a blank shot.  The man\r\nswooned away.  Some of the guards, who were off duty, came\r\nrunning up, but when Amulya fired another blank shot at them they\r\nlost no time in taking cover.  Then Kasim, who was on duty, came\r\nup whirling a quarterstaff.  This time Amulya aimed a bullet at\r\nhis legs, and finding himself hit, Kasim collapsed on the floor.\r\nAmulya then made the trembling manager, who had come to his\r\nsenses, open the safe and deliver up six thousand rupees.\r\nFinally, he took one of the estate horses and galloped off a few\r\nmiles, there let the animal loose, and quietly walked up here, to\r\nour place.\r\n\r\n\"What made you do all this, Amulya?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"There was a grave reason, Maharaja,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But why, then, did you try to return the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her come, at whose command I did so.  In her presence I\r\nshall make a clean breast of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who may 'she' be?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister, the Chota Rani!\"\r\n\r\nI sent for Bimala.  She came hesitatingly, barefoot, with a white\r\nshawl over her head.  I had never seen my Bimal like this before.\r\nShe seemed to have wrapped herself in a morning light.\r\n\r\nAmulya prostrated himself in salutation and took the dust of her\r\nfeet.  Then, as he rose, he said: \"Your command has been\r\nexecuted, sister.  The money is returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have saved me, my little brother,\" said Bimal.\r\n\r\n\"With your image in my mind, I have not uttered a single lie,\"\r\nAmulya continued.  \"My watchword __Bande Mataram__ has been\r\ncast away at your feet for good.  I have also received my reward,\r\nyour __prasad__, as soon as I came to the palace.\"\r\n\r\nBimal looked at him blankly, unable to follow his last words.\r\nAmulya brought out his handkerchief, and untying it showed her\r\nthe cakes put away inside.  \"I did not eat them all,\" he said.\r\n\"I have kept these to eat after you have helped me with your own\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nI could see that I was not wanted here.  I went out of the room.\r\nI could only preach and preach, so I mused, and get my effigy\r\nburnt for my pains.  I had not yet been able to bring back a\r\nsingle soul from the path of death.  They who have the power, can\r\ndo so by a mere sign.  My words have not that ineffable meaning.\r\nI am not a flame, only a black coal, which has gone out.  I can\r\nlight no lamp.  That is what the story of my life shows--my row\r\nof lamps has remained unlit.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n30. Sitting on the bare floor is a sign of mourning, and so, by\r\nassociation of ideas, of an abject attitude of mind.  [Trans.].\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI returned slowly towards the inner apartments.  The Bara Rani's\r\nroom must have been drawing me again.  It had become an absolute\r\nnecessity for me, that day, to feel that this life of mine had\r\nbeen able to strike some real, some responsive chord in some\r\nother harp of life.  One cannot realize one's own existence by\r\nremaining within oneself--it has to be sought outside.\r\n\r\nAs I passed in front of my sister-in-law's room, she came out\r\nsaying: \"I was afraid you would be late again this afternoon.\r\nHowever.  I ordered your dinner as soon as I heard you coming.\r\nIt will be served in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" I said; \"let me take out that money of yours and\r\nhave it kept ready to take with us.\"\r\n\r\nAs we walked on towards my room she asked me if the Police\r\nInspector had made any report about the robbery.  I somehow did\r\nnot feel inclined to tell her all the details of how that six\r\nthousand had come back.  \"That's just what all the fuss is\r\nabout,\" I said evasively.\r\n\r\nWhen I went into my dressing-room and took out my bunch of keys,\r\nI did not find the key of the iron safe on the ring.  What an\r\nabsurdly absent-minded fellow I was, to be sure!  Only this\r\nmorning I had been opening so many boxes and things, and never\r\nnoticed that this key was not there.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened to your key?\"  she asked me.\r\n\r\nI went on fumbling in this pocket and that, but could give her no\r\nanswer.  I hunted in the same place over and over again.  It\r\ndawned on both of us that it could not be a case of the key being\r\nmislaid.  Someone must have taken it off the ring.  Who could it\r\nbe?  Who else could have come into this room?\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about it,\" she said to me.  \"Get through your\r\ndinner first.  The Chota Rani must have kept it herself, seeing\r\nhow absent-minded you are getting.\"\r\n\r\nI was, however, greatly disturbed.  It was never Bimal's habit to\r\ntake any key of mine without telling me about it.  Bimal was not\r\npresent at my meal-time that day: she was busy feasting Amulya in\r\nher own room.  My sister-in-law wanted to send for her, but I\r\nasked her not to do so.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my dinner when Bimal came in.  I would have\r\npreferred not to discuss the matter of the key in the Bara Rani's\r\npresence, but as soon as she saw Bimal, she asked her: \"Do you\r\nknow, dear, where the key of the safe is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I say so!\"  exclaimed my sister-in-law triumphantly.\r\n\"Our Chota Rani pretends not to care about these robberies, but\r\nshe takes precautions on the sly, all the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe look on Bimal's face made my mind misgive me.  \"Let the key\r\nbe, now,\" I said.  \"I will take out that money in the evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go again, putting it off,\" said the Bara Rani.  \"Why\r\nnot take it out and send it to the treasury while you have it in\r\nmind?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have taken it out already,\" said Bimal.\r\n\r\nI was startled.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you kept it, then?\"  asked my sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just listen to her!  Whatever did you spend all that money on?\"\r\n\r\nBimal made no reply.  I asked her nothing further.  The Bara Rani\r\nseemed about to make some further remark to Bimala, but checked\r\nherself.  \"Well, that is all right, anyway,\" she said at length,\r\nas she looked towards me.  \"Just what I used to do with my\r\nhusband's loose cash.  I knew it was no use leaving it with him--\r\nhis hundred and one hangers-on would be sure to get hold of it.\r\nYou are much the same, dear!  What a number of ways you men know\r\nof getting through money.  We can only save it from you by\r\nstealing it ourselves!  Come along now.  Off with you to bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bara Rani led me to my room, but I hardly knew where I was\r\ngoing.  She sat by my bed after I was stretched on it, and smiled\r\nat Bimal as she said: \"Give me one of your pans, Chotie darling--\r\nwhat?  You have none!  You have become a regular mem-sahib.  Then\r\nsend for some from my room.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you had your dinner yet?\"  I anxiously enquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh long ago,\" she replied--clearly a fib.\r\n\r\nShe kept on chattering away there at my bedside, on all manner of\r\nthings.  The maid came and told Bimal that her dinner had been\r\nserved and was getting cold, but she gave no sign of having heard\r\nit.  \"Not had your dinner yet?  What nonsense!  It's fearfully\r\nlate.\"  With this the Bara Rani took Bimal away with her.\r\n\r\nI could divine that there was some connection between the taking\r\nout of this six thousand and the robbing of the other.  But I\r\nhave no curiosity to learn the nature of it.  I shall never ask.\r\n\r\nProvidence leaves our life moulded in the rough--its object being\r\nthat we ourselves should put the finishing touches, shaping it\r\ninto its final form to our taste.  There has always been the\r\nhankering within me to express some great idea in the process of\r\ngiving shape to my life on the lines suggested by the Creator.\r\nIn this endeavour I have spent all my days.  How severely I have\r\ncurbed my desires, repressed myself at every step, only the\r\nSearcher of the Heart knows.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulty is, that one's life is not solely one's own.\r\nHe who would create it must do so with the help of his\r\nsurroundings, or he will fail.  So it was my constant dream to\r\ndraw Bimal to join me in this work of creating myself.  I loved\r\nher with all my soul; on the strength of that, I could not but\r\nsucceed in winning her to my purpose--that was my firm belief.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered that those who could simply and naturally draw\r\ntheir environment into the process of their self-creation\r\nbelonged to one species of the genus \"man\",--and I to another.  I\r\nhad received the vital spark, but could not impart it.  Those to\r\nwhom I have surrendered my all have taken my all, but not myself\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nMy trial is hard indeed.  Just when I want a helpmate most, I am\r\nthrown back on myself alone.  Nevertheless, I record my vow that\r\neven in this trial I shall win through.  Alone, then, shall I\r\ntread my thorny path to the end of this life's journey ...\r\n\r\nI have begun to suspect that there has all along been a vein of\r\ntyranny in me.  There was a despotism in my desire to mould my\r\nrelations with Bimala in a hard, clear-cut, perfect form.  But\r\nman's life was not meant to be cast in a mould.  And if we try to\r\nshape the good, as so much mere material, it takes a terrible\r\nrevenge by losing its life.\r\n\r\nI did not realize all this while that it must have been this\r\nunconscious tyranny of mine which made us gradually drift apart.\r\nBimala's life, not finding its true level by reason of my\r\npressure from above, has had to find an outlet by undermining its\r\nbanks at the bottom.  She has had to steal this six thousand\r\nrupees because she could not be open with me, because she felt\r\nthat, in certain things, I despotically differed from her.\r\n\r\nMen, such as I, possessed with one idea, are indeed at one with\r\nthose who can manage to agree with us; but those who do not, can\r\nonly get on with us by cheating us.  It is our unyielding\r\nobstinacy, which drives even the simplest to tortuous ways.  In\r\ntrying to manufacture a helpmate, we spoil a wife.\r\n\r\nCould I not go back to the beginning?  Then, indeed, I should\r\nfollow the path of the simple.  I should not try to fetter my\r\nlife's companion with my ideas, but play the joyous pipes of my\r\nlove and say: \"Do you love me?  Then may you grow true to\r\nyourself in the light of your love.  Let my suggestions be\r\nsuppressed, let God's design, which is in you, triumph, and my\r\nideas retire abashed.\"\r\n\r\nBut can even Nature's nursing heal the open wound, into which our\r\naccumulated differences have broken out?  The covering veil,\r\nbeneath the privacy of which Nature's silent forces alone can\r\nwork, has been torn asunder.  Wounds must be bandaged--can we not\r\nbandage our wound with our love, so that the day may come when\r\nits scar will no longer be visible?  It is not too late?  So much\r\ntime has been lost in misunderstanding; it has taken right up to\r\nnow to come to an understanding; how much more time will it take\r\nfor the correcting?  What if the wound does eventually heal?--can\r\nthe devastation it has wrought ever be made good?\r\n\r\nThere was a slight sound near the door.  As I turned over I saw\r\nBimala's retreating figure through the open doorway.  She must\r\nhave been waiting by the door, hesitating whether to come in or\r\nnot, and at last have decided to go back.  I jumped up and\r\nbounded to the door, calling: \"Bimal.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped on her way.  She had her back to me.  I went and took\r\nher by the hand and led her into our room.  She threw herself\r\nface downwards on a pillow, and sobbed and sobbed.  I said\r\nnothing, but held her hand as I sat by her head.\r\n\r\nWhen her storm of grief had abated she sat up.  I tried to draw\r\nher to my breast, but she pushed my arms away and knelt at my\r\nfeet, touching them repeatedly with her head, in obeisance.  I\r\nhastily drew my feet back, but she clasped them in her arms,\r\nsaying in a choking voice: \"No, no, no, you must not take away\r\nyour feet.  Let me do my worship.\"\r\n\r\nI kept still.  Who was I to stop her?  Was I the god of her\r\nworship that I should have any qualms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBimala's Story\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, come!  Now is the time to set sail towards that great\r\nconfluence, where the river of love meets the sea of worship.  In\r\nthat pure blue all the weight of its muddiness sinks and\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nI now fear nothing--neither myself, nor anybody else.  I have\r\npassed through fire.  What was inflammable has been burnt to\r\nashes; what is left is deathless.  I have dedicated myself to the\r\nfeet of him, who has received all my sin into the depths of his\r\nown pain.\r\n\r\nTonight we go to Calcutta.  My inward troubles have so long\r\nprevented my looking after my things.  Now let me arrange and\r\npack them.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I found my husband had come in and was taking a\r\nhand in the packing.\r\n\r\n\"This won't do,\" I said.  \"Did you not promise me you would have\r\na sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have made the promise,\" he replied, \"but my sleep did\r\nnot, and it was nowhere to be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" I repeated, \"this will never do.  Lie down for a while,\r\nat least.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can you get through all this alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you may boast of being able to do without me.  But frankly\r\nI can't do without you.  Even sleep refused to come to me, alone,\r\nin that room.\"  Then he set to work again.\r\n\r\nBut there was an interruption, in the shape of a servant, who\r\ncame and said that Sandip Babu had called and had asked to be\r\nannounced.  I did not dare to ask whom he wanted.  The light of\r\nthe sky seemed suddenly to be shut down, like the leaves of a\r\nsensitive plant.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Bimal,\" said my husband.  \"Let us go and hear what Sandip\r\nhas to tell us.  Since he has come back again, after taking his\r\nleave, he must have something special to say.\"\r\n\r\nI went, simply because it would have been still more embarrassing\r\nto stay.  Sandip was staring at a picture on the wall.  As we\r\nentered he said: \"You must be wondering why the fellow has\r\nreturned.  But you know the ghost is never laid till all the\r\nrites are complete.\"  With these words he brought out of his\r\npocket something tied in his handkerchief, and laying it on the\r\ntable, undid the knot.  It was those sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you mistake me, Nikhil,\" he said.  \"You must not imagine\r\nthat the contagion of your company has suddenly turned me honest;\r\nI am not the man to come back in slobbering repentance to return\r\nill-gotten money.  But...\"\r\n\r\nHe left his speech unfinished.  After a pause he turned towards\r\nNikhil, but said to me: \"After all these days, Queen Bee, the\r\nghost of compunction has found an entry into my hitherto\r\nuntroubled conscience.  As I have to wrestle with it every night,\r\nafter my first sleep is over, I cannot call it a phantom of my\r\nimagination.  There is no escape even for me till its debt is\r\npaid.  Into the hands of that spirit, therefore, let me make\r\nrestitution.  Goddess!  From you, alone, of all the world, I\r\nshall not be able to take away anything.  I shall not be rid of\r\nyou till I am destitute.  Take these back!\"\r\n\r\nHe took out at the same time the jewel-casket from under his\r\ntunic and put it down, and then left us with hasty steps.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Sandip,\" my husband called after him.\r\n\r\n\"I have not the time, Nikhil,\" said Sandip as he paused near the\r\ndoor.  \"The Mussulmans, I am told, have taken me for an\r\ninvaluable gem, and are conspiring to loot me and hide me away in\r\ntheir graveyard.  But I feel that it is necessary that I should\r\nlive.  I have just twenty-five minutes to catch the North-bound\r\ntrain.  So, for the present, I must be gone.  We shall have our\r\ntalk out at the next convenient opportunity.  If you take my\r\nadvice, don't you delay in getting away either.  I salute you,\r\nQueen Bee, Queen of the bleeding hearts, Queen of desolation!\"\r\n\r\nSandip then left almost at a run.  I stood stock-still; I had\r\nnever realized in such a manner before, how trivial, how paltry,\r\nthis gold and these jewels were.  Only a short while ago I was so\r\nbusy thinking what I should take with me, and how I should pack\r\nit.  Now I felt that there was no need to take anything at all.\r\nTo set out and go forth was the important thing.\r\n\r\nMy husband left his seat and came up and took me by the hand.\r\n\"It is getting late,\" he said.  \"There is not much time left to\r\ncomplete our preparations for the journey.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Chandranath Babu suddenly came in.  Finding us both\r\ntogether, he fell back for a moment.  Then he said, \"Forgive me,\r\nmy little mother, if I intrude.  Nikhil, the Mussulmans are out\r\nof hand.  They are looting Harish Kundu's treasury.  That does\r\nnot so much matter.  But what is intolerable is the violence that\r\nis being done to the women of their house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am off,\" said my husband.\r\n\r\n\"What can you do there?\"  I pleaded, as I held him by the hand.\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" I appealed to his master.  \"Will you not tell him not\r\nto go?\"\r\n\r\n\"My little mother,\" he replied, \"there is no time to do anything\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed, Bimal,\" said my husband, as he left us.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the window I saw my husband galloping away on\r\nhorseback, with not a weapon in his hands.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the Bara Rani came running in.  \"What have you\r\ndone, Chotie darling,\" she cried.  \"How could you let him go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Call the Dewan at once,\" she said, turning to a servant.\r\n\r\nThe Ranis never appeared before the Dewan, but the Bara Rani had\r\nno thought that day for appearances.\r\n\r\n\"Send a mounted man to bring back the Maharaja at once,\" she\r\nsaid, as soon as the Dewan came up.\r\n\r\n\"We have all entreated him to stay, Rani Mother,\" said the Dewan,\r\n\"but he refused to turn back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send word to him that the Bara Rani is ill, that she is on her\r\ndeath-bed,\" cried my sister-in-law wildly.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dewan had left she turned on me with a furious outburst.\r\n\"Oh, you witch, you ogress, you could not die yourself, but needs\r\nmust send him to his death!  ...\"\r\n\r\nThe light of the day began to fade.  The sun set behind the\r\nfeathery foliage of the blossoming __Sajna__ tree.  I can see\r\nevery different shade of that sunset even today.  Two masses of\r\ncloud on either side of the sinking orb made it look like a great\r\nbird with fiery-feathered wings outspread.  It seemed to me that\r\nthis fateful day was taking its flight, to cross the ocean of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt became darker and darker.  Like the flames of a distant\r\nvillage on fire, leaping up every now and then above the horizon,\r\na distant din swelled up in recurring waves into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe bells of the evening worship rang out from our temple.  I\r\nknew the Bara Rani was sitting there, with palms joined in silent\r\nprayer.  But I could not move a step from the window.\r\n\r\nThe roads, the village beyond, and the still more distant fringe\r\nof trees, grew more and more vague.  The lake in our grounds\r\nlooked up into the sky with a dull lustre, like a blind man's\r\neye.  On the left the tower seemed to be craning its neck to\r\ncatch sight of something that was happening.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of night take on all manner of disguises.  A twig\r\nsnaps, and one thinks that somebody is running for his life.  A\r\ndoor slams, and one feels it to be the sudden heart-thump of a\r\nstartled world.\r\n\r\nLights would suddenly flicker under the shade of the distant\r\ntrees, and then go out again.  Horses' hoofs would clatter, now\r\nand again, only to turn out to be riders leaving the palace\r\ngates.\r\n\r\nI continually had the feeling that, if only I could die, all this\r\nturmoil would come to an end.  So long as I was alive my sins\r\nwould remain rampant, scattering destruction on every side.  I\r\nremembered the pistol in my box.  But my feet refused to leave\r\nthe window in quest of it.  Was I not awaiting my fate?\r\n\r\nThe gong of the watch solemnly struck ten.  A little later,\r\ngroups of lights appeared in the distance and a great crowd wound\r\nits way, like some great serpent, along the roads in the\r\ndarkness, towards the palace gates.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan rushed to the gate at the sound.  Just then a rider\r\ncame galloping in.  \"What's the news, Jata?\"  asked the Dewan.\r\n\r\n\"Not good,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nI could hear these words distinctly from my window.  But\r\nsomething was next whispered which I could not catch.\r\n\r\nThen came a palanquin, followed by a litter.  The doctor was\r\nwalking alongside the palanquin.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, doctor?\"  asked the Dewan.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say yet,\" the doctor replied.  \"The wound in the head is a\r\nserious one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Amulya Babu?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a bullet through the heart.  He is done for.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Home and the World by Rabindranath Tagore.\r\nTranslated [from Bengali to English] by Surendranath Tagore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Home and the World, by Rabindranath Tagore",

These have offered us problems and claimed their solutions\r\nfrom us, the penalty of non-fulfilment being death or degradation.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties have been different in different peoples of the\r\nearth, and in the manner of our overcoming them lies our distinction.\r\n\r\nThe Scythians of the earlier period of Asiatic history had to struggle\r\nwith the scarcity of their natural resources. The easiest solution that\r\nthey could think of was to organize their whole population, men, women,\r\nand children, into bands of robbers. And they were irresistible to those\r\nwho were chiefly engaged in the constructive work of social\r\nco-operation.\r\n\r\nBut fortunately for man the easiest path is not his truest path. If his\r\nnature were not as complex as it is, if it were as simple as that of a\r\npack of hungry wolves, then, by this time, those hordes of marauders\r\nwould have overrun the whole earth. But man, when confronted with\r\ndifficulties, has to acknowledge that he is man, that he has his\r\nresponsibilities to the higher faculties of his nature, by ignoring\r\nwhich he may achieve success that is immediate, perhaps, but that will\r\nbecome a death-trap to him. For what are obstacles to the lower\r\ncreatures are opportunities to the higher life of man.\r\n\r\nTo India has been given her problem from the beginning of history--it is\r\nthe race problem. Races ethnologically different have in this country\r\ncome into close contact. This fact has been and still continues to be\r\nthe most important one in our history. It is our mission to face it and\r\nprove our humanity by dealing with it in the fullest truth. Until we\r\nfulfil our mission all other benefits will be denied us.\r\n\r\nThere are other peoples in the world who have to overcome obstacles in\r\ntheir physical surroundings, or the menace of their powerful neighbours.\r\nThey have organized their power till they are not only reasonably free\r\nfrom the tyranny of Nature and human neighbours, but have a surplus of\r\nit left in their hands to employ against others. But in India, our\r\ndifficulties being internal, our history has been the history of\r\ncontinual social adjustment and not that of organized power for defence\r\nand aggression.\r\n\r\nNeither the colourless vagueness of cosmopolitanism, nor the fierce\r\nself-idolatry of nation-worship, is the goal of human history. And India\r\nhas been trying to accomplish her task through social regulation of\r\ndifferences, on the one hand, and the spiritual recognition of unity on\r\nthe other. She has made grave errors in setting up the boundary walls\r\ntoo rigidly between races, in perpetuating in her classifications the\r\nresults of inferiority; often she has crippled her children's minds and\r\nnarrowed their lives in order to fit them into her social forms; but for\r\ncenturies new experiments have been made and adjustments carried out.\r\n\r\nHer mission has been like that of a hostess who has to provide proper\r\naccommodation for numerous guests, whose habits and requirements are\r\ndifferent from one another. This gives rise to infinite complexities\r\nwhose solution depends not merely upon tactfulness but upon sympathy and\r\ntrue realization of the unity of man. Towards this realization have\r\nworked, from the early time of the Upanishads up to the present moment,\r\na series of great spiritual teachers, whose one object has been to set\r\nat naught all differences of man by the overflow of our consciousness of\r\nGod. In fact, our history has not been of the rise and fall of kingdoms,\r\nof fights for political supremacy. In our country records of these days\r\nhave been despised and forgotten, for they in no way represent the true\r\nhistory of our people. Our history is that of our social life and\r\nattainment of spiritual ideals.\r\n\r\nBut we feel that our task is not yet done. The world-flood has swept\r\nover our country, new elements have been introduced, and wider\r\nadjustments are waiting to be made.\r\n\r\nWe feel this all the more, because the teaching and example of the West\r\nhave entirely run counter to what we think was given to India to\r\naccomplish. In the West the national machinery of commerce and politics\r\nturns out neatly compressed bales of humanity which have their use and\r\nhigh market value; but they are bound in iron hoops, labelled and\r\nseparated off with scientific care and precision. Obviously God made man\r\nto be human; but this modern product has such marvellous square-cut\r\nfinish, savouring of gigantic manufacture, that the Creator will find it\r\ndifficult to recognize it as a thing of spirit and a creature made in\r\nHis own divine image.\r\n\r\nBut I am anticipating. What I was about to say is this. Take it in\r\nwhatever spirit you like, here is India, of about fifty centuries at\r\nleast, who tried to live peacefully and think deeply, the India devoid\r\nof all politics, the India of no nations, whose one ambition has been to\r\nknow this world as of soul, to live here every moment of her life in the\r\nmeek spirit of adoration, in the glad consciousness of an eternal and\r\npersonal relationship with it. It was upon this remote portion of\r\nhumanity, childlike in its manner, with the wisdom of the old, that the\r\nNation of the West burst in.\r\n\r\nThrough all the fights and intrigues and deceptions of her earlier\r\nhistory India had remained aloof. Because her homes, her fields, her\r\ntemples of worship, her schools, where her teachers and students lived\r\ntogether in the atmosphere of simplicity and devotion and learning, her\r\nvillage self-government with its simple laws and peaceful\r\nadministration--all these truly belonged to her. But her thrones were\r\nnot her concern. They passed over her head like clouds, now tinged with\r\npurple gorgeousness, now black with the threat of thunder. Often they\r\nbrought devastations in their wake, but they were like catastrophes of\r\nnature whose traces are soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut this time it was different. It was not a mere drift over her\r\nsurface of life,--drift of cavalry and foot soldiers, richly caparisoned\r\nelephants, white tents and canopies, strings of patient camels bearing\r\nthe loads of royalty, bands of kettle-drums and flutes, marble domes of\r\nmosques, palaces and tombs, like the bubbles of the foaming wine of\r\nextravagance; stories of treachery and loyal devotion, of changes of\r\nfortune, of dramatic surprises of fate. This time it was the Nation of\r\nthe West driving its tentacles of machinery deep down into the soil.\r\n\r\nTherefore I say to you, it is we who are called as witnesses to give\r\nevidence as to what our Nation has been to humanity. We had known the\r\nhordes of Moghals and Pathans who invaded India, but we had known them\r\nas human races, with their own religions and customs, likes and\r\ndislikes,--we had never known them as a nation. We loved and hated them\r\nas occasions arose; we fought for them and against them, talked with\r\nthem in a language which was theirs as well as our own, and guided the\r\ndestiny of the Empire in which we had our active share. But this time we\r\nhad to deal, not with kings, not with human races, but with a\r\nnation--we, who are no nation ourselves.\r\n\r\nNow let us from our own experience answer the question, What is this\r\nNation?\r\n\r\nA nation, in the sense of the political and economic union of a people,\r\nis that aspect which a whole population assumes when organized for a\r\nmechanical purpose. Society as such has no ulterior purpose. It is an\r\nend in itself. It is a spontaneous self-expression of man as a social\r\nbeing. It is a natural regulation of human relationships, so that men\r\ncan develop ideals of life in co-operation with one another. It has also\r\na political side, but this is only for a special purpose. It is for\r\nself-preservation. It is merely the side of power, not of human ideals.\r\nAnd in the early days it had its separate place in society, restricted\r\nto the professionals. But when with the help of science and the\r\nperfecting of organization this power begins to grow and brings in\r\nharvests of wealth, then it crosses its boundaries with amazing\r\nrapidity. For then it goads all its neighbouring societies with greed of\r\nmaterial prosperity, and consequent mutual jealousy, and by the fear of\r\neach other's growth into powerfulness. The time comes when it can stop\r\nno longer, for the competition grows keener, organization grows vaster,\r\nand selfishness attains supremacy. Trading upon the greed and fear of\r\nman, it occupies more and more space in society, and at last becomes its\r\nruling force.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that you have lost through habit consciousness that\r\nthe living bonds of society are breaking up, and giving place to merely\r\nmechanical organization. But you see signs of it everywhere. It is owing\r\nto this that war has been declared between man and woman, because the\r\nnatural thread is snapping which holds them together in harmony; because\r\nman is driven to professionalism, producing wealth for himself and\r\nothers, continually turning the wheel of power for his own sake or for\r\nthe sake of the universal officialdom, leaving woman alone to wither and\r\nto die or to fight her own battle unaided. And thus there where\r\nco-operation is natural has intruded competition. The very psychology of\r\nmen and women about their mutual relation is changing and becoming the\r\npsychology of the primitive fighting elements, rather than of humanity\r\nseeking its completeness through the union based upon mutual\r\nself-surrender. For the elements which have lost their living bond of\r\nreality have lost the meaning of their existence. Like gaseous particles\r\nforced into a too narrow space, they come in continual conflict with\r\neach other till they burst the very arrangement which holds them in\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nThen look at those who call themselves anarchists, who resent the\r\nimposition of power, in any form whatever, upon the individual. The only\r\nreason for this is that power has become too abstract--it is a\r\nscientific product made in the political laboratory of the Nation,\r\nthrough the dissolution of personal humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the meaning of these strikes in the economic world, which\r\nlike the prickly shrubs in a barren soil shoot up with renewed vigour\r\neach time they are cut down? What, but that the wealth-producing\r\nmechanism is incessantly growing into vast stature, out of proportion to\r\nall other needs of society,--and the full reality of man is more and\r\nmore crushed under its weight? This state of things inevitably gives\r\nrise to eternal feuds among the elements freed from the wholeness and\r\nwholesomeness of human ideals, and interminable economic war is waged\r\nbetween capital and labour. For greed of wealth and power can never have\r\na limit, and compromise of self-interest can never attain the final\r\nspirit of reconciliation. They must go on breeding jealousy and\r\nsuspicion to the end--the end which only comes through some sudden\r\ncatastrophe or a spiritual re-birth.\r\n\r\nWhen this organization of politics and commerce, whose other name is the\r\nNation, becomes all-powerful at the cost of the harmony of the higher\r\nsocial life, then it is an evil day for humanity. When a father becomes\r\na gambler and his obligations to his family take the secondary place in\r\nhis mind, then he is no longer a man, but an automaton led by the power\r\nof greed. Then he can do things which, in his normal state of mind, he\r\nwould be ashamed to do. It is the same thing with society. When it\r\nallows itself to be turned into a perfect organization of power, then\r\nthere are few crimes which it is unable to perpetrate. Because success\r\nis the object and justification of a machine, while goodness only is the\r\nend and purpose of man. When this engine of organization begins to\r\nattain a vast size, and those who are mechanics are made into parts of\r\nthe machine, then the personal man is eliminated to a phantom,\r\neverything becomes a revolution of policy carried out by the human parts\r\nof the machine, with no twinge of pity or moral responsibility. It may\r\nhappen that even through this apparatus the moral nature of man tries\r\nto assert itself, but the whole series of ropes and pullies creak and\r\ncry, the forces of the human heart become entangled among the forces of\r\nthe human automaton, and only with difficulty can the moral purpose\r\ntransmit itself into some tortured shape of result.\r\n\r\nThis abstract being, the Nation, is ruling India. We have seen in our\r\ncountry some brand of tinned food advertised as entirely made and packed\r\nwithout being touched by hand. This description applies to the governing\r\nof India, which is as little touched by the human hand as possible. The\r\ngovernors need not know our language, need not come into personal touch\r\nwith us except as officials; they can aid or hinder our aspirations from\r\na disdainful distance, they can lead us on a certain path of policy and\r\nthen pull us back again with the manipulation of office red tape; the\r\nnewspapers of England, in whose columns London street accidents are\r\nrecorded with some decency of pathos, need but take the scantiest notice\r\nof calamities which happen in India over areas of land sometimes larger\r\nthan the British Isles.\r\n\r\nBut we, who are governed, are not a mere abstraction. We, on our side,\r\nare individuals with living sensibilities. What comes to us in the\r\nshape of a mere bloodless policy may pierce into the very core of our\r\nlife, may threaten the whole future of our people with a perpetual\r\nhelplessness of emasculation, and yet may never touch the chord of\r\nhumanity on the other side, or touch it in the most inadequately feeble\r\nmanner. Such wholesale and universal acts of fearful responsibility man\r\ncan never perform, with such a degree of systematic unawareness, where\r\nhe is an individual human being. These only become possible, where the\r\nman is represented by an octopus of abstractions, sending out its\r\nwriggling arms in all directions of space, and fixing its innumerable\r\nsuckers even into the far-away future. In this reign of the nation, the\r\ngoverned are pursued by suspicions; and these are the suspicions of a\r\ntremendous mass of organized brain and muscle. Punishments are meted\r\nout, which leave a trail of miseries across a large bleeding tract of\r\nthe human heart; but these punishments are dealt by a mere abstract\r\nforce, in which a whole population of a distant country has lost its\r\nhuman personality.\r\n\r\nI have not come here, however, to discuss the question as it affects my\r\nown country, but as it affects the future of all humanity. It is not a\r\nquestion of the British Government, but of government by the Nation--the\r\nNation which is the organized self-interest of a whole people, where it\r\nis least human and least spiritual. Our only intimate experience of the\r\nNation is with the British Nation, and as far as the government by the\r\nNation goes there are reasons to believe that it is one of the best.\r\nThen, again, we have to consider that the West is necessary to the East.\r\nWe are complementary to each other because of our different outlooks\r\nupon life which have given us different aspects of truth. Therefore if\r\nit be true that the spirit of the West has come upon our fields in the\r\nguise of a storm it is nevertheless scattering living seeds that are\r\nimmortal. And when in India we become able to assimilate in our life\r\nwhat is permanent in Western civilization we shall be in the position to\r\nbring about a reconciliation of these two great worlds. Then will come\r\nto an end the one-sided dominance which is galling. What is more, we\r\nhave to recognize that the history of India does not belong to one\r\nparticular race but to a process of creation to which various races of\r\nthe world contributed--the Dravidians and the Aryans, the ancient Greeks\r\nand the Persians, the Mohammedans of the West and those of central\r\nAsia. Now at last has come the turn of the English to become true to\r\nthis history and bring to it the tribute of their life, and we neither\r\nhave the right nor the power to exclude this people from the building of\r\nthe destiny of India. Therefore what I say about the Nation has more to\r\ndo with the history of Man than specially with that of India.\r\n\r\nThis history has come to a stage when the moral man, the complete man,\r\nis more and more giving way, almost without knowing it, to make room for\r\nthe political and the commercial man, the man of the limited purpose.\r\nThis process, aided by the wonderful progress in science, is assuming\r\ngigantic proportion and power, causing the upset of man's moral balance,\r\nobscuring his human side under the shadow of soul-less organization. We\r\nhave felt its iron grip at the root of our life, and for the sake of\r\nhumanity we must stand up and give warning to all, that this nationalism\r\nis a cruel epidemic of evil that is sweeping over the human world of the\r\npresent age, and eating into its moral vitality.\r\n\r\nI have a deep love and a great respect for the British race as human\r\nbeings. It has produced great-hearted men, thinkers of great thoughts,\r\ndoers of great deeds. It has given rise to a great literature. I know\r\nthat these people love justice and freedom, and hate lies. They are\r\nclean in their minds, frank in their manners, true in their friendships;\r\nin their behaviour they are honest and reliable. The personal experience\r\nwhich I have had of their literary men has roused my admiration not\r\nmerely for their power of thought or expression but for their chivalrous\r\nhumanity. We have felt the greatness of this people as we feel the sun;\r\nbut as for the Nation, it is for us a thick mist of a stifling nature\r\ncovering the sun itself.\r\n\r\nThis government by the Nation is neither British nor anything else; it\r\nis an applied science and therefore more or less similar in its\r\nprinciples wherever it is used. It is like a hydraulic press, whose\r\npressure is impersonal, and on that account completely effective. The\r\namount of its power may vary in different engines. Some may even be\r\ndriven by hand, thus leaving a margin of comfortable looseness in their\r\ntension, but in spirit and in method their differences are small. Our\r\ngovernment might have been Dutch, or French, or Portuguese, and its\r\nessential features would have remained much the same as they are now.\r\nOnly perhaps, in some cases, the organization might not have been so\r\ndensely perfect, and, therefore, some shreds of the human might still\r\nhave been clinging to the wreck, allowing us to deal with something\r\nwhich resembles our own throbbing heart.\r\n\r\nBefore the Nation came to rule over us we had other governments which\r\nwere foreign, and these, like all governments, had some element of the\r\nmachine in them. But the difference between them and the government by\r\nthe Nation is like the difference between the hand-loom and the\r\npower-loom. In the products of the hand-loom the magic of man's living\r\nfingers finds its expression, and its hum harmonizes with the music of\r\nlife. But the power-loom is relentlessly lifeless and accurate and\r\nmonotonous in its production.\r\n\r\nWe must admit that during the personal government of the former days\r\nthere have been instances of tyranny, injustice and extortion. They\r\ncaused sufferings and unrest from which we are glad to be rescued. The\r\nprotection of law is not only a boon, but it is a valuable lesson to us.\r\nIt is teaching us the discipline which is necessary for the stability of\r\ncivilization and for continuity of progress. We are realizing through it\r\nthat there is a universal standard of justice to which all men,\r\nirrespective of their caste and colour, have their equal claim.\r\n\r\nThis reign of law in our present Government in India has established\r\norder in this vast land inhabited by peoples different in their races\r\nand customs. It has made it possible for these peoples to come in closer\r\ntouch with one another and cultivate a communion of aspiration.\r\n\r\nBut this desire for a common bond of comradeship among the different\r\nraces of India has been the work of the spirit of the West, not that of\r\nthe Nation of the West. Wherever in Asia the people have received the\r\ntrue lesson of the West it is in spite of the Western Nation. Only\r\nbecause Japan had been able to resist the dominance of this Western\r\nNation could she acquire the benefit of the Western Civilization in\r\nfullest measure. Though China has been poisoned at the very spring of\r\nher moral and physical life by this Nation, her struggle to receive the\r\nbest lessons of the West may yet be successful if not hindered by the\r\nNation. It was only the other day that Persia woke up from her age-long\r\nsleep at the call of the West to be instantly trampled into stillness by\r\nthe Nation. The same phenomenon prevails in this country also, where the\r\npeople are hospitable, but the Nation has proved itself to be\r\notherwise, making an Eastern guest feel humiliated to stand before you\r\nas a member of the humanity of his own motherland.\r\n\r\nIn India we are suffering from this conflict between the spirit of the\r\nWest and the Nation of the West. The benefit of the Western civilization\r\nis doled out to us in a miserly measure by the Nation, which tries to\r\nregulate the degree of nutrition as near the zero-point of vitality as\r\npossible. The portion of education allotted to us is so raggedly\r\ninsufficient that it ought to outrage the sense of decency of a Western\r\nhumanity. We have seen in these countries how the people are encouraged\r\nand trained and given every facility to fit themselves for the great\r\nmovements of commerce and industry spreading over the world, while in\r\nIndia the only assistance we get is merely to be jeered at by the Nation\r\nfor lagging behind. While depriving us of our opportunities and reducing\r\nour education to the minimum required for conducting a foreign\r\ngovernment, this Nation pacifies its conscience by calling us names, by\r\nsedulously giving currency to the arrogant cynicism that the East is\r\neast and the West is west and never the twain shall meet. If we must\r\nbelieve our schoolmaster in his taunt that, after nearly two centuries\r\nof his tutelage, India not only remains unfit for self-government but\r\nunable to display originality in her intellectual attainments, must we\r\nascribe it to something in the nature of Western culture and our\r\ninherent incapacity to receive it or to the judicious niggardliness of\r\nthe Nation that has taken upon itself the white man's burden of\r\ncivilizing the East? That Japanese people have some qualities which we\r\nlack we may admit, but that our intellect is naturally unproductive\r\ncompared to theirs we cannot accept even from them whom it is dangerous\r\nfor us to contradict.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the spirit of conflict and conquest is at the origin\r\nand in the centre of Western nationalism; its basis is not social\r\nco-operation. It has evolved a perfect organization of power, but not\r\nspiritual idealism. It is like the pack of predatory creatures that must\r\nhave its victims. With all its heart it cannot bear to see its\r\nhunting-grounds converted into cultivated fields. In fact, these nations\r\nare fighting among themselves for the extension of their victims and\r\ntheir reserve forests. Therefore the Western Nation acts like a dam to\r\ncheck the free flow of Western civilization into the country of the\r\nNo-Nation. Because this civilization is the civilization of power,\r\ntherefore it is exclusive, it is naturally unwilling to open its\r\nsources of power to those whom it has selected for its purposes of\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nBut all the same moral law is the law of humanity, and the exclusive\r\ncivilization which thrives upon others who are barred from its benefit\r\ncarries its own death-sentence in its moral limitations. The slavery\r\nthat it gives rise to unconsciously drains its own love of freedom dry.\r\nThe helplessness with which it weighs down its world of victims exerts\r\nits force of gravitation every moment upon the power that creates it.\r\nAnd the greater part of the world which is being denuded of its\r\nself-sustaining life by the Nation will one day become the most terrible\r\nof all its burdens, ready to drag it down into the bottom of\r\ndestruction. Whenever Power removes all checks from its path to make its\r\ncareer easy, it triumphantly rides into its ultimate crash of death. Its\r\nmoral brake becomes slacker every day without its knowing it, and its\r\nslippery path of ease becomes its path of doom.\r\n\r\nOf all things in Western civilization, those which this Western Nation\r\nhas given us in a most generous measure are law and order. While the\r\nsmall feeding-bottle of our education is nearly dry, and sanitation\r\nsucks its own thumb in despair, the military organization, the\r\nmagisterial offices, the police, the Criminal Investigation Department,\r\nthe secret spy system, attain to an abnormal girth in their waists,\r\noccupying every inch of our country. This is to maintain order. But is\r\nnot this order merely a negative good? Is it not for giving people's\r\nlife greater opportunities for the freedom of development? Its\r\nperfection is the perfection of an egg-shell, whose true value lies in\r\nthe security it affords to the chick and its nourishment and not in the\r\nconvenience it offers to the person at the breakfast table. Mere\r\nadministration is unproductive, it is not creative, not being a living\r\nthing. It is a steam-roller, formidable in its weight and power, having\r\nits uses, but it does not help the soil to become fertile. When after\r\nits enormous toil it comes to offer us its boon of peace we can but\r\nmurmur under our breath that \"peace is good, but not more so than life,\r\nwhich is God's own great boon.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our former governments were woefully lacking in many\r\nof the advantages of the modern government. But because those were not\r\nthe governments by the Nation, their texture was loosely woven, leaving\r\nbig gaps through which our own life sent its threads and imposed its\r\ndesigns. I am quite sure in those days we had things that were extremely\r\ndistasteful to us. But we know that when we walk barefooted upon ground\r\nstrewn with gravel, our feet come gradually to adjust themselves to the\r\ncaprices of the inhospitable earth; while if the tiniest particle of\r\ngravel finds its lodgment inside our shoes we can never forget and\r\nforgive its intrusion. And these shoes are the government by the\r\nNation,--it is tight, it regulates our steps with a closed-up system,\r\nwithin which our feet have only the slightest liberty to make their own\r\nadjustments. Therefore, when you produce your statistics to compare the\r\nnumber of gravels which our feet had to encounter in former days with\r\nthe paucity in the present régime, they hardly touch the real points. It\r\nis not a question of the number of outside obstacles but the comparative\r\npowerlessness of the individual to cope with them. This narrowness of\r\nfreedom is an evil which is more radical, not because of its quantity\r\nbut because of its nature. And we cannot but acknowledge this paradox,\r\nthat while the spirit of the West marches under its banner of freedom,\r\nthe Nation of the West forges its iron chains of organization which are\r\nthe most relentless and unbreakable that have ever been manufactured in\r\nthe whole history of man.\r\n\r\nWhen the humanity of India was not under the government of the\r\nOrganization, the elasticity of change was great enough to encourage men\r\nof power and spirit to feel that they had their destinies in their own\r\nhands. The hope of the unexpected was never absent, and a freer play of\r\nimagination, on the part both of the governor and the governed, had its\r\neffect in the making of history. We were not confronted with a future,\r\nwhich was a dead white wall of granite blocks eternally guarding against\r\nthe expression and extension of our own powers, the hopelessness of\r\nwhich lies in the reason that these powers are becoming atrophied at\r\ntheir very roots by the scientific process of paralysis. For every\r\nsingle individual in the country of the No-Nation is completely in the\r\ngrip of a whole nation,--whose tireless vigilance, being the vigilance\r\nof a machine, has not the human power to overlook or to discriminate. At\r\nthe least pressing of its button the monster organization becomes all\r\neyes, whose ugly stare of inquisitiveness cannot be avoided by a single\r\nperson amongst the immense multitude of the ruled. At the least turn of\r\nits screw, by the fraction of an inch, the grip is tightened to the\r\npoint of suffocation around every man, woman and child of a vast\r\npopulation, for whom no escape is imaginable in their own country, or\r\neven in any country outside their own.\r\n\r\nIt is the continual and stupendous dead pressure of this inhuman upon\r\nthe living human under which the modern world is groaning. Not merely\r\nthe subject races, but you who live under the delusion that you are\r\nfree, are every day sacrificing your freedom and humanity to this fetich\r\nof nationalism, living in the dense poisonous atmosphere of world-wide\r\nsuspicion and greed and panic.\r\n\r\nI have seen in Japan the voluntary submission of the whole people to the\r\ntrimming of their minds and clipping of their freedom by their\r\ngovernment, which through various educational agencies regulates their\r\nthoughts, manufactures their feelings, becomes suspiciously watchful\r\nwhen they show signs of inclining toward the spiritual, leading them\r\nthrough a narrow path not toward what is true but what is necessary for\r\nthe complete welding of them into one uniform mass according to its own\r\nrecipe. The people accept this all-pervading mental slavery with\r\ncheerfulness and pride because of their nervous desire to turn\r\nthemselves into a machine of power, called the Nation, and emulate other\r\nmachines in their collective worldliness.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned as to the wisdom of its course the newly converted\r\nfanatic of nationalism answers that \"so long as nations are rampant in\r\nthis world we have not the option freely to develop our higher humanity.\r\nWe must utilize every faculty that we possess to resist the evil by\r\nassuming it ourselves in the fullest degree. For the only brotherhood\r\npossible in the modern world is the brotherhood of hooliganism.\" The\r\nrecognition of the fraternal bond of love between Japan and Russia,\r\nwhich has lately been celebrated with an immense display of rejoicing in\r\nJapan, was not owing to any sudden recrudescence of the spirit of\r\nChristianity or of Buddhism, but it was a bond established according to\r\nthe modern faith in a surer relationship of mutual menace of\r\nbloodshedding. Yes, one cannot but acknowledge that these facts are the\r\nfacts of the world of the Nation, and the only moral of it is that all\r\nthe peoples of the earth should strain their physical, moral and\r\nintellectual resources to the utmost to defeat one another in the\r\nwrestling match of powerfulness. In the ancient days Sparta paid all\r\nher attention to becoming powerful; she did become so by crippling her\r\nhumanity, and died of the amputation.\r\n\r\nBut it is no consolation to us to know that the weakening of humanity\r\nfrom which the present age is suffering is not limited to the subject\r\nraces, and that its ravages are even more radical because insidious and\r\nvoluntary in peoples who are hypnotized into believing that they are\r\nfree. This bartering of your higher aspirations of life for profit and\r\npower has been your own free choice, and I leave you there, at the\r\nwreckage of your soul, contemplating your protuberant prosperity. But\r\nwill you never be called to answer for organizing the instincts of\r\nself-aggrandizement of whole peoples into perfection and calling it\r\ngood? I ask you what disaster has there ever been in the history of man,\r\nin its darkest period, like this terrible disaster of the Nation fixing\r\nits fangs deep into the naked flesh of the world, taking permanent\r\nprecautions against its natural relaxation?\r\n\r\nYou, the people of the West, who have manufactured this abnormality, can\r\nyou imagine the desolating despair of this haunted world of suffering\r\nman possessed by the ghastly abstraction of the organizing man? Can you\r\nput yourself into the position of the peoples, who seem to have been\r\ndoomed to an eternal damnation of their own humanity, who not only must\r\nsuffer continual curtailment of their manhood, but even raise their\r\nvoices in pæans of praise for the benignity of a mechanical apparatus in\r\nits interminable parody of providence?\r\n\r\nHave you not seen, since the commencement of the existence of the\r\nNation, that the dread of it has been the one goblin-dread with which\r\nthe whole world has been trembling? Wherever there is a dark corner,\r\nthere is the suspicion of its secret malevolence; and people live in a\r\nperpetual distrust of its back where it has no eyes. Every sound of a\r\nfootstep, every rustle of movement in the neighbourhood, sends a thrill\r\nof terror all around. And this terror is the parent of all that is base\r\nin man's nature. It makes one almost openly unashamed of inhumanity.\r\nClever lies become matters of self-congratulation. Solemn pledges become\r\na farce,--laughable for their very solemnity. The Nation, with all its\r\nparaphernalia of power and prosperity, its flags and pious hymns, its\r\nblasphemous prayers in the churches, and the literary mock thunders of\r\nits patriotic bragging, cannot hide the fact that the Nation is the\r\ngreatest evil for the Nation, that all its precautions are against it,\r\nand any new birth of its fellow in the world is always followed in its\r\nmind by the dread of a new peril. Its one wish is to trade on the\r\nfeebleness of the rest of the world, like some insects that are bred in\r\nthe paralysed flesh of victims kept just enough alive to make them\r\ntoothsome and nutritious. Therefore it is ready to send its poisonous\r\nfluid into the vitals of the other living peoples, who, not being\r\nnations, are harmless. For this the Nation has had and still has its\r\nrichest pasture in Asia. Great China, rich with her ancient wisdom and\r\nsocial ethics, her discipline of industry and self-control, is like a\r\nwhale awakening the lust of spoil in the heart of the Nation. She is\r\nalready carrying in her quivering flesh harpoons sent by the unerring\r\naim of the Nation, the creature of science and selfishness. Her pitiful\r\nattempt to shake off her traditions of humanity, her social ideals, and\r\nspend her last exhausted resources in drilling herself into modern\r\nefficiency, is thwarted at every step by the Nation. It is tightening\r\nits financial ropes round her, trying to drag her up on the shore and\r\ncut her into pieces, and then go and offer public thanksgiving to God\r\nfor supporting the one existing evil and shattering the possibility of a\r\nnew one. And for all this the Nation has been claiming the gratitude of\r\nhistory, and all eternity for its exploitation; ordering its band of\r\npraise to be struck up from end to end of the world, declaring itself to\r\nbe the salt of the earth, the flower of humanity, the blessing of God\r\nhurled with all His force upon the naked skulls of the world of\r\nNo-Nations.\r\n\r\nI know what your advice will be. You will say, form yourselves into a\r\nnation, and resist this encroachment of the Nation. But is this the true\r\nadvice? that of a man to a man? Why should this be a necessity? I could\r\nwell believe you if you had said, Be more good, more just, more true in\r\nyour relation to man, control your greed, make your life wholesome in\r\nits simplicity and let your consciousness of the divine in humanity be\r\nmore perfect in its expression. But must you say that it is not the\r\nsoul, but the machine, which is of the utmost value to ourselves, and\r\nthat man's salvation depends upon his disciplining himself into a\r\nperfection of the dead rhythm of wheels and counterwheels? that machine\r\nmust be pitted against machine, and nation against nation, in an endless\r\nbull-fight of politics?\r\n\r\nYou say, these machines will come into an agreement, for their mutual\r\nprotection, based upon a conspiracy of fear. But will this federation\r\nof steam-boilers supply you with a soul, a soul which has her conscience\r\nand her God? What is to happen to that larger part of the world where\r\nfear will have no hand in restraining you? Whatever safety they now\r\nenjoy, those countries of No-Nation, from the unbridled license of forge\r\nand hammer and turn-screw, results from the mutual jealousy of the\r\npowers. But when, instead of being numerous separate machines, they\r\nbecome riveted into one organized gregariousness of gluttony, commercial\r\nand political, what remotest chance of hope will remain for those\r\nothers, who have lived and suffered, have loved and worshipped, have\r\nthought deeply and worked with meekness, but whose only crime has been\r\nthat they have not organized?\r\n\r\nBut, you say, \"That does not matter, the unfit must go to the wall--they\r\nshall _die_, and this is science.\"\r\n\r\nNo, for the sake of your own salvation, I say, they shall _live_, and\r\nthis is truth. It is extremely bold of me to say so, but I assert that\r\nman's world is a moral world, not because we blindly agree to believe\r\nit, but because it is so in truth which would be dangerous for us to\r\nignore. And this moral nature of man cannot be divided into convenient\r\ncompartments for its preservation. You cannot secure it for your home\r\nconsumption with protective tariff walls, while in foreign parts making\r\nit enormously accommodating in its free trade of license.\r\n\r\nHas not this truth already come home to you now, when this cruel war has\r\ndriven its claws into the vitals of Europe? when her hoard of wealth is\r\nbursting into smoke and her humanity is shattered into bits on her\r\nbattlefields? You ask in amazement what has she done to deserve this?\r\nThe answer is, that the West has been systematically petrifying her\r\nmoral nature in order to lay a solid foundation for her gigantic\r\nabstractions of efficiency. She has all along been starving the life of\r\nthe personal man into that of the professional.\r\n\r\nIn your mediæval age in Europe, the simple and the natural man, with all\r\nhis violent passions and desires, was engaged in trying to find out a\r\nreconciliation in the conflict between the flesh and the spirit. All\r\nthrough the turbulent career of her vigorous youth the temporal and the\r\nspiritual forces both acted strongly upon her nature, and were moulding\r\nit into completeness of moral personality. Europe owes all her greatness\r\nin humanity to that period of discipline,--the discipline of the man in\r\nhis human integrity.\r\n\r\nThen came the age of intellect, of science. We all know that intellect\r\nis impersonal. Our life, and our heart, are one with us, but our mind\r\ncan be detached from the personal man and then only can it freely move\r\nin its world of thoughts. Our intellect is an ascetic who wears no\r\nclothes, takes no food, knows no sleep, has no wishes, feels no love or\r\nhatred or pity for human limitations, who only reasons, unmoved, through\r\nthe vicissitudes of life. It burrows to the roots of things, because it\r\nhas no personal concern with the thing itself. The grammarian walks\r\nstraight through all poetry and goes to the root of words without\r\nobstruction, because he is not seeking reality, but law. When he finds\r\nthe law, he is able to teach people how to master words. This is a\r\npower,--the power which fulfils some special usefulness, some particular\r\nneed of man.\r\n\r\nReality is the harmony which gives to the component parts of a thing the\r\nequilibrium of the whole. You break it, and have in your hands the\r\nnomadic atoms fighting against one another, therefore unmeaning. Those\r\nwho covet power try to get mastery of these aboriginal fighting\r\nelements, and through some narrow channels force them into some violent\r\nservice for some particular needs of man.\r\n\r\nThis satisfaction of man's needs is a great thing. It gives him freedom\r\nin the material world. It confers on him the benefit of a greater range\r\nof time and space. He can do things in a shorter time and occupies a\r\nlarger space with more thoroughness of advantage. Therefore he can\r\neasily outstrip those who live in a world of a slower time and of space\r\nless fully occupied.\r\n\r\nThis progress of power attains more and more rapidity of pace. And, for\r\nthe reason that it is a detached part of man, it soon outruns the\r\ncomplete humanity. The moral man remains behind, because it has to deal\r\nwith the whole reality, not merely with the law of things, which is\r\nimpersonal and therefore abstract.\r\n\r\nThus, man with his mental and material power far outgrowing his moral\r\nstrength, is like an exaggerated giraffe whose head has suddenly shot up\r\nmiles away from the rest of him, making normal communication difficult\r\nto establish. This greedy head, with its huge dental organization, has\r\nbeen munching all the topmost foliage of the world, but the nourishment\r\nis too late in reaching his digestive organs, and his heart is\r\nsuffering from want of blood. Of this present disharmony in man's nature\r\nthe West seems to have been blissfully unconscious. The enormity of its\r\nmaterial success has diverted all its attention toward\r\nself-congratulation on its bulk. The optimism of its logic goes on\r\nbasing the calculations of its good fortune upon the indefinite\r\nprolongation of its railway lines toward eternity. It is superficial\r\nenough to think that all to-morrows are merely to-days, with the\r\nrepeated additions of twenty-four hours. It has no fear of the chasm,\r\nwhich is opening wider every day, between man's ever-growing storehouses\r\nand the emptiness of his hungry humanity. Logic does not know that,\r\nunder the lowest bed of endless strata of wealth and comforts,\r\nearthquakes are being hatched to restore the balance of the moral world,\r\nand one day the gaping gulf of spiritual vacuity will draw into its\r\nbottom the store of things that have their eternal love for the dust.\r\n\r\nMan in his fulness is not powerful, but perfect. Therefore, to turn him\r\ninto mere power, you have to curtail his soul as much as possible. When\r\nwe are fully human, we cannot fly at one another's throats; our\r\ninstincts of social life, our traditions of moral ideals stand in the\r\nway. If you want me to take to butchering human beings, you must break\r\nup that wholeness of my humanity through some discipline which makes my\r\nwill dead, my thoughts numb, my movements automatic, and then from the\r\ndissolution of the complex personal man will come out that abstraction,\r\nthat destructive force, which has no relation to human truth, and\r\ntherefore can be easily brutal or mechanical. Take away man from his\r\nnatural surroundings, from the fulness of his communal life, with all\r\nits living associations of beauty and love and social obligations, and\r\nyou will be able to turn him into so many fragments of a machine for the\r\nproduction of wealth on a gigantic scale. Turn a tree into a log and it\r\nwill burn for you, but it will never bear living flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\nThis process of dehumanizing has been going on in commerce and politics.\r\nAnd out of the long birth-throes of mechanical energy has been born this\r\nfully developed apparatus of magnificent power and surprising appetite\r\nwhich has been christened in the West as the Nation. As I have hinted\r\nbefore, because of its quality of abstraction it has, with the greatest\r\nease, gone far ahead of the complete moral man. And having the\r\nconscience of a ghost and the callous perfection of an automaton, it is\r\ncausing disasters of which the volcanic dissipations of the youthful\r\nmoon would be ashamed to be brought into comparison. As a result, the\r\nsuspicion of man for man stings all the limbs of this civilization like\r\nthe hairs of the nettle. Each country is casting its net of espionage\r\ninto the slimy bottom of the others, fishing for their secrets, the\r\ntreacherous secrets which brew in the oozy depths of diplomacy. And what\r\nis their secret service but the nation's underground trade in\r\nkidnapping, murder and treachery and all the ugly crimes bred in the\r\ndepth of rottenness? Because each nation has its own history of thieving\r\nand lies and broken faith, therefore there can only flourish\r\ninternational suspicion and jealousy, and international moral shame\r\nbecomes anæmic to a degree of ludicrousness. The nation's bagpipe of\r\nrighteous indignation has so often changed its tune according to the\r\nvariation of time and to the altered groupings of the alliances of\r\ndiplomacy, that it can be enjoyed with amusement as the variety\r\nperformance of the political music hall.\r\n\r\nI am just coming from my visit to Japan, where I exhorted this young\r\nnation to take its stand upon the higher ideals of humanity and never\r\nto follow the West in its acceptance of the organized selfishness of\r\nNationalism as its religion, never to gloat upon the feebleness of its\r\nneighbours, never to be unscrupulous in its behaviour to the weak, where\r\nit can be gloriously mean with impunity, while turning its right cheek\r\nof brighter humanity for the kiss of admiration to those who have the\r\npower to deal it a blow. Some of the newspapers praised my utterances\r\nfor their poetical qualities, while adding with a leer that it was the\r\npoetry of a defeated people. I felt they were right. Japan had been\r\ntaught in a modern school the lesson how to become powerful. The\r\nschooling is done and she must enjoy the fruits of her lessons. The West\r\nin the voice of her thundering cannon had said at the door of Japan, Let\r\nthere be a nation--and there was a Nation. And now that it _has_ come\r\ninto existence, why do you not feel in your heart of hearts a pure\r\nfeeling of gladness and say that it is good? Why is it that I saw in an\r\nEnglish paper an expression of bitterness at Japan's boasting of her\r\nsuperiority of civilization--the thing that the British, along with\r\nother nations, has been carrying on for ages without blushing? Because\r\nthe idealism of selfishness must keep itself drunk with a continual dose\r\nof self-laudation. But the same vices which seem so natural and\r\ninnocuous in its own life make it surprised and angry at their\r\nunpleasantness when seen in other nations. Therefore, when you see the\r\nJapanese nation, created in your own image, launched in its career of\r\nnational boastfulness you shake your head and say, it is not good. Has\r\nit not been one of the causes that raise the cry on these shores for\r\npreparedness to meet one more power of evil with a greater power of\r\ninjury? Japan protests that she has her _bushido_, that she can never be\r\ntreacherous to America, to whom she owes her gratitude. But you find it\r\ndifficult to believe her,--for the wisdom of the Nation is not in its\r\nfaith in humanity but in its complete distrust. You say to yourself that\r\nit is not with Japan of the _bushido_, the Japan of the moral ideals,\r\nthat you have to deal--it is with the abstraction of the popular\r\nselfishness, it is with the Nation; and Nation can only trust Nation\r\nwhere their interests coalesce, or at least do not conflict. In fact\r\nyour instinct tells you that the advent of another people into the arena\r\nof nationality makes another addition to the evil which contradicts all\r\nthat is highest in Man and proves by its success that unscrupulousness\r\nis the way to prosperity,--and goodness is good for the weak and God is\r\nthe only remaining consolation of the defeated.\r\n\r\nYes, this is the logic of the Nation. And it will never heed the voice\r\nof truth and goodness. It will go on in its ring-dance of moral\r\ncorruption, linking steel unto steel, and machine unto machine;\r\ntrampling under its tread all the sweet flowers of simple faith and the\r\nliving ideals of man.\r\n\r\nBut we delude ourselves into thinking that humanity in the modern days\r\nis more to the front than ever before. The reason of this self-delusion\r\nis because man is served with the necessaries of life in greater\r\nprofusion, and his physical ills are being alleviated with more\r\nefficacy. But the chief part of this is done, not by moral sacrifice,\r\nbut by intellectual power. In quantity it is great, but it springs from\r\nthe surface and spreads over the surface. Knowledge and efficiency are\r\npowerful in their outward effect, but they are the servants of man, not\r\nthe man himself. Their service is like the service in a hotel, where it\r\nis elaborate, but the host is absent; it is more convenient than\r\nhospitable.\r\n\r\nTherefore we must not forget that the scientific organizations vastly\r\nspreading in all directions are strengthening our power, but not our\r\nhumanity. With the growth of power the cult of the self-worship of the\r\nNation grows in ascendancy; and the individual willingly allows the\r\nNation to take donkey-rides upon his back; and there happens the anomaly\r\nwhich must have such disastrous effects, that the individual worships\r\nwith all sacrifices a god which is morally much inferior to himself.\r\nThis could never have been possible if the god had been as real as the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nLet me give an illustration of this in point. In some parts of India it\r\nhas been enjoined as an act of great piety for a widow to go without\r\nfood and water on a particular day every fortnight. This often leads to\r\ncruelty, unmeaning and inhuman. And yet men are not by nature cruel to\r\nsuch a degree. But this piety being a mere unreal abstraction completely\r\ndeadens the moral sense of the individual, just as the man, who would\r\nnot hurt an animal unnecessarily, would cause horrible suffering to a\r\nlarge number of innocent creatures when he drugs his feelings with the\r\nabstract idea of \"sport.\" Because these ideas are the creations of our\r\nintellect, because they are logical classifications, therefore they can\r\nso easily hide in their mist the personal man.\r\n\r\nAnd the idea of the Nation is one of the most powerful anæsthetics that\r\nman has invented. Under the influence of its fumes the whole people can\r\ncarry out its systematic programme of the most virulent self-seeking\r\nwithout being in the least aware of its moral perversion,--in fact\r\nfeeling dangerously resentful if it is pointed out.\r\n\r\nBut can this go on indefinitely? continually producing barrenness of\r\nmoral insensibility upon a large tract of our living nature? Can it\r\nescape its nemesis for ever? Has this giant power of mechanical\r\norganization no limit in this world against which it may shatter itself\r\nall the more completely because of its terrible strength and velocity?\r\nDo you believe that evil can be permanently kept in check by competition\r\nwith evil, and that conference of prudence can keep the devil chained in\r\nits makeshift cage of mutual agreement?\r\n\r\nThis European war of Nations is the war of retribution. Man, the person,\r\nmust protest for his very life against the heaping up of things where\r\nthere should be the heart, and systems and policies where there should\r\nflow living human relationship. The time has come when, for the sake of\r\nthe whole outraged world, Europe should fully know in her own person the\r\nterrible absurdity of the thing called the Nation.\r\n\r\nThe Nation has thriven long upon mutilated humanity. Men, the fairest\r\ncreations of God, came out of the National manufactory in huge numbers\r\nas war-making and money-making puppets, ludicrously vain of their\r\npitiful perfection of mechanism. Human society grew more and more into a\r\nmarionette show of politicians, soldiers, manufacturers and bureaucrats,\r\npulled by wire arrangements of wonderful efficiency.\r\n\r\nBut the apotheosis of selfishness can never make its interminable breed\r\nof hatred and greed, fear and hypocrisy, suspicion and tyranny, an end\r\nin themselves. These monsters grow into huge shapes but never into\r\nharmony. And this Nation may grow on to an unimaginable corpulence, not\r\nof a living body, but of steel and steam and office buildings, till its\r\ndeformity can contain no longer its ugly voluminousness,--till it begins\r\nto crack and gape, breathe gas and fire in gasps, and its death-rattles\r\nsound in cannon roars. In this war the death-throes of the Nation have\r\ncommenced. Suddenly, all its mechanism going mad, it has begun the dance\r\nof the Furies, shattering its own limbs, scattering them into the dust.\r\nIt is the fifth act of the tragedy of the unreal.\r\n\r\nThose who have any faith in Man cannot but fervently hope that the\r\ntyranny of the Nation will not be restored to all its former teeth and\r\nclaws, to its far-reaching iron arms and its immense inner cavity, all\r\nstomach and no heart; that man will have his new birth, in the freedom\r\nof his individuality, from the enveloping vagueness of abstraction.\r\n\r\nThe veil has been raised, and in this frightful war the West has stood\r\nface to face with her own creation, to which she had offered her soul.\r\nShe must know what it truly is.\r\n\r\nShe had never let herself suspect what slow decay and decomposition were\r\nsecretly going on in her moral nature, which often broke out in\r\ndoctrines of scepticism, but still oftener and in still more dangerously\r\nsubtle manner showed itself in her unconsciousness of the mutilation and\r\ninsult that she had been inflicting upon a vast part of the world. Now\r\nshe must know the truth nearer home.\r\n\r\nAnd then there will come from her own children those who will break\r\nthemselves free from the slavery of this illusion, this perversion of\r\nbrotherhood founded upon self-seeking, those who will own themselves as\r\nGod's children and as no bond-slaves of machinery, which turns souls\r\ninto commodities and life into compartments, which, with its iron\r\nclaws, scratches out the heart of the world and knows not what it has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAnd we of no nations of the world, whose heads have been bowed to the\r\ndust, will know that this dust is more sacred than the bricks which\r\nbuild the pride of power. For this dust is fertile of life, and of\r\nbeauty and worship. We shall thank God that we were made to wait in\r\nsilence through the night of despair, had to bear the insult of the\r\nproud and the strong man's burden, yet all through it, though our hearts\r\nquaked with doubt and fear, never could we blindly believe in the\r\nsalvation which machinery offered to man, but we held fast to our trust\r\nin God and the truth of the human soul. And we can still cherish the\r\nhope that, when power becomes ashamed to occupy its throne and is ready\r\nto make way for love, when the morning comes for cleansing the\r\nblood-stained steps of the Nation along the highroad of humanity, we\r\nshall be called upon to bring our own vessel of sacred water--the water\r\nof worship--to sweeten the history of man into purity, and with its\r\nsprinkling make the trampled dust of the centuries blessed with\r\nfruitfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONALISM IN JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe worst form of bondage is the bondage of dejection, which keeps men\r\nhopelessly chained in loss of faith in themselves. We have been\r\nrepeatedly told, with some justification, that Asia lives in the\r\npast,--it is like a rich mausoleum which displays all its magnificence\r\nin trying to immortalize the dead. It was said of Asia that it could\r\nnever move in the path of progress, its face was so inevitably turned\r\nbackwards. We accepted this accusation, and came to believe it. In\r\nIndia, I know, a large section of our educated community, grown tired of\r\nfeeling the humiliation of this charge against us, is trying all its\r\nresources of self-deception to turn it into a matter of boasting. But\r\nboasting is only a masked shame, it does not truly believe in itself.\r\n\r\nWhen things stood still like this, and we in Asia hypnotized ourselves\r\ninto the belief that it could never by any possibility be otherwise,\r\nJapan rose from her dreams, and in giant strides left centuries of\r\ninaction behind, overtaking the present time in its foremost\r\nachievement. This has broken the spell under which we lay in torpor for\r\nages, taking it to be the normal condition of certain races living in\r\ncertain geographical limits. We forgot that in Asia great kingdoms were\r\nfounded, philosophy, science, arts and literatures flourished, and all\r\nthe great religions of the world had their cradles. Therefore it cannot\r\nbe said that there is anything inherent in the soil and climate of Asia\r\nto produce mental inactivity and to atrophy the faculties which impel\r\nmen to go forward. For centuries we did hold torches of civilization in\r\nthe East when the West slumbered in darkness, and that could never be\r\nthe sign of sluggish mind or narrowness of vision.\r\n\r\nThen fell the darkness of night upon all the lands of the East. The\r\ncurrent of time seemed to stop at once, and Asia ceased to take any new\r\nfood, feeding upon its own past, which is really feeding upon itself.\r\nThe stillness seemed like death, and the great voice was silenced which\r\nsent forth messages of eternal truth that have saved man's life from\r\npollution for generations, like the ocean of air that keeps the earth\r\nsweet, ever cleansing its impurities.\r\n\r\nBut life has its sleep, its periods of inactivity, when it loses its\r\nmovements, takes no new food, living upon its past storage. Then it\r\ngrows helpless, its muscles relaxed, and it easily lends itself to be\r\njeered at for its stupor. In the rhythm of life, pauses there must be\r\nfor the renewal of life. Life in its activity is ever spending itself,\r\nburning all its fuel. This extravagance cannot go on indefinitely, but\r\nis always followed by a passive stage, when all expenditure is stopped\r\nand all adventures abandoned in favour of rest and slow recuperation.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of mind is economical, it loves to form habits and move in\r\ngrooves which save it the trouble of thinking anew at each of its steps.\r\nIdeals once formed make the mind lazy. It becomes afraid to risk its\r\nacquisitions in fresh endeavours. It tries to enjoy complete security by\r\nshutting up its belongings behind fortifications of habits. But this is\r\nreally shutting oneself up from the fullest enjoyment of one's own\r\npossessions. It is miserliness. The living ideals must not lose their\r\ntouch with the growing and changing life. Their real freedom is not\r\nwithin the boundaries of security, but in the highroad of adventures,\r\nfull of the risk of new experiences.\r\n\r\nOne morning the whole world looked up in surprise when Japan broke\r\nthrough her walls of old habits in a night and came out triumphant. It\r\nwas done in such an incredibly short time that it seemed like a change\r\nof dress and not like the building up of a new structure. She showed the\r\nconfident strength of maturity, and the freshness and infinite\r\npotentiality of new life at the same moment. The fear was entertained\r\nthat it was a mere freak of history, a child's game of Time, the blowing\r\nup of a soap-bubble, perfect in its rondure and colouring, hollow in its\r\nheart and without substance. But Japan has proved conclusively that this\r\nsudden revealment of her power is not a short-lived wonder, a chance\r\nproduct of time and tide, thrown up from the depth of obscurity to be\r\nswept away the next moment into the sea of oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Japan is old and new at the same time. She has her\r\nlegacy of ancient culture from the East,--the culture that enjoins man\r\nto look for his true wealth and power in his inner soul, the culture\r\nthat gives self-possession in the face of loss and danger,\r\nself-sacrifice without counting the cost or hoping for gain, defiance\r\nof death, acceptance of countless social obligations that we owe to men\r\nas social beings. In a word, modern Japan has come out of the immemorial\r\nEast like a lotus blossoming in easy grace, all the while keeping its\r\nfirm hold upon the profound depth from which it has sprung.\r\n\r\nAnd Japan, the child of the Ancient East, has also fearlessly claimed\r\nall the gifts of the modern age for herself. She has shown her bold\r\nspirit in breaking through the confinements of habits, useless\r\naccumulations of the lazy mind, which seeks safety in its thrift and its\r\nlocks and keys. Thus she has come in contact with the living time and\r\nhas accepted with eagerness and aptitude the responsibilities of modern\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThis it is which has given heart to the rest of Asia. We have seen that\r\nthe life and the strength are there in us, only the dead crust has to be\r\nremoved. We have seen that taking shelter in the dead is death itself,\r\nand only taking all the risk of life to the fullest extent is living.\r\n\r\nI, for myself, cannot believe that Japan has become what she is by\r\nimitating the West. We cannot imitate life, we cannot simulate strength\r\nfor long, nay, what is more, a mere imitation is a source of weakness.\r\nFor it hampers our true nature, it is always in our way. It is like\r\ndressing our skeleton with another man's skin, giving rise to eternal\r\nfeuds between the skin and the bones at every movement.\r\n\r\nThe real truth is that science is not man's nature, it is mere knowledge\r\nand training. By knowing the laws of the material universe you do not\r\nchange your deeper humanity. You can borrow knowledge from others, but\r\nyou cannot borrow temperament.\r\n\r\nBut at the imitative stage of our schooling we cannot distinguish\r\nbetween the essential and the non-essential, between what is\r\ntransferable and what is not. It is something like the faith of the\r\nprimitive mind in the magical properties of the accidents of outward\r\nforms which accompany some real truth. We are afraid of leaving out\r\nsomething valuable and efficacious by not swallowing the husk with the\r\nkernel. But while our greed delights in wholesale appropriation, it is\r\nthe function of our vital nature to assimilate, which is the only true\r\nappropriation for a living organism. Where there is life it is sure to\r\nassert itself by its choice of acceptance and refusal according to its\r\nconstitutional necessity. The living organism does not allow itself to\r\ngrow into its food, it changes its food into its own body. And only thus\r\ncan it grow strong and not by mere accumulation, or by giving up its\r\npersonal identity.\r\n\r\nJapan has imported her food from the West, but not her vital nature.\r\nJapan cannot altogether lose and merge herself in the scientific\r\nparaphernalia she has acquired from the West and be turned into a mere\r\nborrowed machine. She has her own soul, which must assert itself over\r\nall her requirements. That she is capable of doing so, and that the\r\nprocess of assimilation is going on, have been amply proved by the signs\r\nof vigorous health that she exhibits. And I earnestly hope that Japan\r\nmay never lose her faith in her own soul, in the mere pride of her\r\nforeign acquisition. For that pride itself is a humiliation, ultimately\r\nleading to poverty and weakness. It is the pride of the fop who sets\r\nmore store on his new headdress than on his head itself.\r\n\r\nThe whole world waits to see what this great Eastern nation is going to\r\ndo with the opportunities and responsibilities she has accepted from the\r\nhands of the modern time. If it be a mere reproduction of the West, then\r\nthe great expectation she has raised will remain unfulfilled. For there\r\nare grave questions that the Western civilization has presented before\r\nthe world but not completely answered. The conflict between the\r\nindividual and the state, labour and capital, the man and the woman; the\r\nconflict between the greed of material gain and the spiritual life of\r\nman, the organized selfishness of nations and the higher ideals of\r\nhumanity; the conflict between all the ugly complexities inseparable\r\nfrom giant organizations of commerce and state and the natural instincts\r\nof man crying for simplicity and beauty and fulness of leisure,--all\r\nthese have to be brought to a harmony in a manner not yet dreamt of.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this great stream of civilization choking itself from\r\ndébris carried by its innumerable channels. We have seen that with all\r\nits vaunted love of humanity it has proved itself the greatest menace to\r\nMan, far worse than the sudden outbursts of nomadic barbarism from which\r\nmen suffered in the early ages of history. We have seen that, in spite\r\nof its boasted love of freedom, it has produced worse forms of slavery\r\nthan ever were current in earlier societies,--slavery whose chains are\r\nunbreakable, either because they are unseen, or because they assume the\r\nnames and appearance of freedom. We have seen, under the spell of its\r\ngigantic sordidness, man losing faith in all the heroic ideals of life\r\nwhich have made him great.\r\n\r\nTherefore you cannot with a light heart accept the modern civilization\r\nwith all its tendencies, methods and structures, and dream that they are\r\ninevitable. You must apply your Eastern mind, your spiritual strength,\r\nyour love of simplicity, your recognition of social obligation, in order\r\nto cut out a new path for this great unwieldy car of progress, shrieking\r\nout its loud discords as it runs. You must minimize the immense\r\nsacrifice of man's life and freedom that it claims in its every\r\nmovement. For generations you have felt and thought and worked, have\r\nenjoyed and worshipped in your own special manner; and this cannot be\r\ncast off like old clothes. It is in your blood, in the marrow of your\r\nbones, in the texture of your flesh, in the tissue of your brains; and\r\nit must modify everything you lay your hands upon, without your knowing,\r\neven against your wishes. Once you did solve the problems of man to your\r\nown satisfaction, you had your philosophy of life and evolved your own\r\nart of living. All this you must apply to the present situation, and out\r\nof it will arise a new creation and not a mere repetition, a creation\r\nwhich the soul of your people will own for itself and proudly offer to\r\nthe world as its tribute to the welfare of man. Of all countries in\r\nAsia, here in Japan you have the freedom to use the materials you have\r\ngathered from the West according to your genius and your need. Therefore\r\nyour responsibility is all the greater, for in your voice Asia shall\r\nanswer the questions that Europe has submitted to the conference of Man.\r\nIn your land the experiments will be carried on by which the East will\r\nchange the aspects of modern civilization, infusing life in it where it\r\nis a machine, substituting the human heart for cold expediency, not\r\ncaring so much for power and success as for harmonious and living\r\ngrowth, for truth and beauty.\r\n\r\nI cannot but bring to your mind those days when the whole of Eastern\r\nAsia from Burma to Japan was united with India in the closest tie of\r\nfriendship, the only natural tie which can exist between nations. There\r\nwas a living communication of hearts, a nervous system evolved through\r\nwhich messages ran between us about the deepest needs of humanity. We\r\ndid not stand in fear of each other, we had not to arm ourselves to keep\r\neach other in check; our relation was not that of self-interest, of\r\nexploration and spoliation of each other's pockets; ideas and ideals\r\nwere exchanged, gifts of the highest love were offered and taken; no\r\ndifference of languages and customs hindered us in approaching each\r\nother heart to heart; no pride of race or insolent consciousness of\r\nsuperiority, physical or mental, marred our relation; our arts and\r\nliteratures put forth new leaves and flowers under the influence of this\r\nsunlight of united hearts; and races belonging to different lands and\r\nlanguages and histories acknowledged the highest unity of man and the\r\ndeepest bond of love. May we not also remember that in those days of\r\npeace and goodwill, of men uniting for those supreme ends of life, your\r\nnature laid by for itself the balm of immortality which has helped your\r\npeople to be born again in a new age, to be able to survive its old\r\noutworn structures and take on a new young body, to come out unscathed\r\nfrom the shock of the most wonderful revolution that the world has ever\r\nseen?\r\n\r\nThe political civilization which has sprung up from the soil of Europe\r\nand is overrunning the whole world, like some prolific weed, is based\r\nupon exclusiveness. It is always watchful to keep the aliens at bay or\r\nto exterminate them. It is carnivorous and cannibalistic in its\r\ntendencies, it feeds upon the resources of other peoples and tries to\r\nswallow their whole future. It is always afraid of other races achieving\r\neminence, naming it as a peril, and tries to thwart all symptoms of\r\ngreatness outside its own boundaries, forcing down races of men who are\r\nweaker, to be eternally fixed in their weakness. Before this political\r\ncivilization came to its power and opened its hungry jaws wide enough to\r\ngulp down great continents of the earth, we had wars, pillages, changes\r\nof monarchy and consequent miseries, but never such a sight of fearful\r\nand hopeless voracity, such wholesale feeding of nation upon nation,\r\nsuch huge machines for turning great portions of the earth into\r\nmince-meat, never such terrible jealousies with all their ugly teeth and\r\nclaws ready for tearing open each other's vitals. This political\r\ncivilization is scientific, not human. It is powerful because it\r\nconcentrates all its forces upon one purpose, like a millionaire\r\nacquiring money at the cost of his soul. It betrays its trust, it weaves\r\nits meshes of lies without shame, it enshrines gigantic idols of greed\r\nin its temples, taking great pride in the costly ceremonials of its\r\nworship, calling this patriotism. And it can be safely prophesied that\r\nthis cannot go on, for there is a moral law in this world which has its\r\napplication both to individuals and to organized bodies of men. You\r\ncannot go on violating these laws in the name of your nation, yet enjoy\r\ntheir advantage as individuals. This public sapping of ethical ideals\r\nslowly reacts upon each member of society, gradually breeding weakness,\r\nwhere it is not seen, and causing that cynical distrust of all things\r\nsacred in human nature, which is the true symptom of senility. You must\r\nkeep in mind that this political civilization, this creed of national\r\npatriotism, has not been given a long trial. The lamp of ancient Greece\r\nis extinct in the land where it was first lighted, the power of Rome\r\nlies dead and buried under the ruins of its vast empire. But the\r\ncivilization, whose basis is society and the spiritual ideal of man, is\r\nstill a living thing in China and in India. Though it may look feeble\r\nand small, judged by the standard of the mechanical power of modern\r\ndays, yet like small seeds it still contains life and will sprout and\r\ngrow, and spread its beneficent branches, producing flowers and fruits\r\nwhen its time comes and showers of grace descend upon it from heaven.\r\nBut ruins of sky-scrapers of power and broken machinery of greed, even\r\nGod's rain is powerless to raise up again; for they were not of life,\r\nbut went against life as a whole,--they are relics of the rebellion that\r\nshattered itself to pieces against the eternal.\r\n\r\nBut the charge is brought against us that the ideals we cherish in the\r\nEast are static, that they have not the impetus in them to move, to open\r\nout new vistas of knowledge and power, that the systems of philosophy\r\nwhich are the mainstays of the time-worn civilizations of the East\r\ndespise all outward proofs, remaining stolidly satisfied in their\r\nsubjective certainty. This proves that when our knowledge is vague we\r\nare apt to accuse of vagueness our object of knowledge itself. To a\r\nWestern observer our civilization appears as all metaphysics, as to a\r\ndeaf man piano-playing appears to be mere movements of fingers and no\r\nmusic. He cannot think that we have found some deep basis of reality\r\nupon which we have built our institutions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately all proofs of reality are in realization. The reality of\r\nthe scene before you depends only upon the fact that you can see, and it\r\nis difficult for us to prove to an unbeliever that our civilization is\r\nnot a nebulous system of abstract speculations, that it has achieved\r\nsomething which is a positive truth,--a truth that can give man's heart\r\nits shelter and sustenance. It has evolved an inner sense,--a sense of\r\nvision, the vision of the infinite reality in all finite things.\r\n\r\nBut he says, \"You do not make any progress, there is no movement in\r\nyou.\" I ask him, \"How do you know it? You have to judge progress\r\naccording to its aim. A railway train makes its progress towards the\r\nterminus station,--it is movement. But a full-grown tree has no definite\r\nmovement of that kind, its progress is the inward progress of life. It\r\nlives, with its aspiration towards light tingling in its leaves and\r\ncreeping in its silent sap.\"\r\n\r\nWe also have lived for centuries, we still live, and we have our\r\naspiration for a reality that has no end to its realization,--a reality\r\nthat goes beyond death, giving it a meaning, that rises above all evils\r\nof life, bringing its peace and purity, its cheerful renunciation of\r\nself. The product of this inner life is a living product. It will be\r\nneeded when the youth returns home weary and dust-laden, when the\r\nsoldier is wounded, when the wealth is squandered away and pride is\r\nhumbled, when man's heart cries for truth in the immensity of facts and\r\nharmony in the contradiction of tendencies. Its value is not in its\r\nmultiplication of materials, but in its spiritual fulfilment.\r\n\r\nThere are things that cannot wait. You have to rush and run and march if\r\nyou must fight or take the best place in the market. You strain your\r\nnerves and are on the alert when you chase opportunities that are always\r\non the wing. But there are ideals which do not play hide-and-seek with\r\nour life; they slowly grow from seed to flower, from flower to fruit;\r\nthey require infinite space and heaven's light to mature, and the fruits\r\nthat they produce can survive years of insult and neglect. The East with\r\nher ideals, in whose bosom are stored the ages of sunlight and silence\r\nof stars, can patiently wait till the West, hurrying after the\r\nexpedient, loses breath and stops. Europe, while busily speeding to her\r\nengagements, disdainfully casts her glance from her carriage window at\r\nthe reaper reaping his harvest in the field, and in her intoxication of\r\nspeed cannot but think him as slow and ever receding backwards. But the\r\nspeed comes to its end, the engagement loses its meaning and the hungry\r\nheart clamours for food, till at last she comes to the lowly reaper\r\nreaping his harvest in the sun. For if the office cannot wait, or the\r\nbuying and selling, or the craving for excitement, love waits and\r\nbeauty and the wisdom of suffering and the fruits of patient devotion\r\nand reverent meekness of simple faith. And thus shall wait the East till\r\nher time comes.\r\n\r\nI must not hesitate to acknowledge where Europe is great, for great she\r\nis without doubt. We cannot help loving her with all our heart, and\r\npaying her the best homage of our admiration,--the Europe who, in her\r\nliterature and art, pours out an inexhaustible cascade of beauty and\r\ntruth fertilizing all countries and all time; the Europe who, with a\r\nmind which is titanic in its untiring power, is sweeping the height and\r\nthe depth of the universe, winning her homage of knowledge from the\r\ninfinitely great and the infinitely small, applying all the resources of\r\nher great intellect and heart in healing the sick and alleviating those\r\nmiseries of man which up till now we were contented to accept in a\r\nspirit of hopeless resignation; the Europe who is making the earth yield\r\nmore fruit than seemed possible, coaxing and compelling the great forces\r\nof nature into man's service. Such true greatness must have its motive\r\npower in spiritual strength. For only the spirit of man can defy all\r\nlimitations, have faith in its ultimate success, throw its search-light\r\nbeyond the immediate and the apparent, gladly suffer martyrdom for ends\r\nwhich cannot be achieved in its lifetime and accept failure without\r\nacknowledging defeat. In the heart of Europe runs the purest stream of\r\nhuman love, of love of justice, of spirit of self-sacrifice for higher\r\nideals. The Christian culture of centuries has sunk deep in her life's\r\ncore. In Europe we have seen noble minds who have ever stood up for the\r\nrights of man irrespective of colour and creed; who have braved calumny\r\nand insult from their own people in fighting for humanity's cause and\r\nraising their voices against the mad orgies of militarism, against the\r\nrage for brutal retaliation or rapacity that sometimes takes possession\r\nof a whole people; who are always ready to make reparation for wrongs\r\ndone in the past by their own nations and vainly attempt to stem the\r\ntide of cowardly injustice that flows unchecked because the resistance\r\nis weak and innocuous on the part of the injured. There are these\r\nknight-errants of modern Europe who have not lost their faith in the\r\ndisinterested love of freedom, in the ideals which own no geographical\r\nboundaries or national self-seeking. These are there to prove that the\r\nfountainhead of the water of everlasting life has not run dry in Europe,\r\nand from thence she will have her rebirth time after time. Only there,\r\nwhere Europe is too consciously busy in building up her power, defying\r\nher deeper nature and mocking it, she is heaping up her iniquities to\r\nthe sky, crying for God's vengeance and spreading the infection of\r\nugliness, physical and moral, over the face of the earth with her\r\nheartless commerce heedlessly outraging man's sense of the beautiful and\r\nthe good. Europe is supremely good in her beneficence where her face is\r\nturned to all humanity; and Europe is supremely evil in her maleficent\r\naspect where her face is turned only upon her own interest, using all\r\nher power of greatness for ends which are against the infinite and the\r\neternal in Man.\r\n\r\nEastern Asia has been pursuing its own path, evolving its own\r\ncivilization, which was not political but social, not predatory and\r\nmechanically efficient but spiritual and based upon all the varied and\r\ndeeper relations of humanity. The solutions of the life problems of\r\npeoples were thought out in seclusion and carried out behind the\r\nsecurity of aloofness, where all the dynastic changes and foreign\r\ninvasions hardly touched them. But now we are overtaken by the outside\r\nworld, our seclusion is lost for ever. Yet this we must not regret, as a\r\nplant should never regret when the obscurity of its seed-time is\r\nbroken. Now the time has come when we must make the world problem our\r\nown problem; we must bring the spirit of our civilization into harmony\r\nwith the history of all nations of the earth; we must not, in foolish\r\npride, still keep ourselves fast within the shell of the seed and the\r\ncrust of the earth which protected and nourished our ideals; for these,\r\nthe shell and the crust, were meant to be broken, so that life may\r\nspring up in all its vigour and beauty, bringing its offerings to the\r\nworld in open light.\r\n\r\nIn this task of breaking the barrier and facing the world Japan has come\r\nout the first in the East. She has infused hope in the heart of all\r\nAsia. This hope provides the hidden fire which is needed for all works\r\nof creation. Asia now feels that she must prove her life by producing\r\nliving work, she must not lie passively dormant, or feebly imitate the\r\nWest, in the infatuation of fear or flattery. For this we offer our\r\nthanks to this Land of the Rising Sun and solemnly ask her to remember\r\nthat she has the mission of the East to fulfil. She must infuse the sap\r\nof a fuller humanity into the heart of modern civilization. She must\r\nnever allow it to get choked with the noxious undergrowth, but lead it\r\nup towards light and freedom, towards the pure air and broad space,\r\nwhere it can receive, in the dawn of its day and the darkness of its\r\nnight, heaven's inspiration. Let the greatness of her ideals become\r\nvisible to all men like her snow-crowned Fuji rising from the heart of\r\nthe country into the region of the infinite, supremely distinct from its\r\nsurroundings, beautiful like a maiden in its magnificent sweep of curve,\r\nyet firm and strong and serenely majestic.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI have travelled in many countries and have met with men of all classes,\r\nbut never in my travels did I feel the presence of the human so\r\ndistinctly as in this land. In other great countries signs of man's\r\npower loomed large, and I saw vast organizations which showed efficiency\r\nin all their features. There, display and extravagance, in dress, in\r\nfurniture, in costly entertainments, are startling. They seem to push\r\nyou back into a corner, like a poor intruder at a feast; they are apt to\r\nmake you envious, or take your breath away with amazement. There, you do\r\nnot feel man as supreme; you are hurled against a stupendousness of\r\nthings that alienates. But in Japan it is not the display of power, or\r\nwealth, that is the predominating element. You see everywhere emblems of\r\nlove and admiration, and not mostly of ambition and greed. You see a\r\npeople whose heart has come out and scattered itself in profusion in its\r\ncommonest utensils of everyday life, in its social institutions, in its\r\nmanners, which are carefully perfect, and in its dealings with things\r\nwhich are not only deft but graceful in every movement.\r\n\r\nWhat has impressed me most in this country is the conviction that you\r\nhave realized nature's secrets, not by methods of analytical knowledge,\r\nbut by sympathy. You have known her language of lines, and music of\r\ncolours, the symmetry in her irregularities, and the cadence in her\r\nfreedom of movements; you have seen how she leads her immense crowds of\r\nthings yet avoids all frictions; how the very conflicts in her creations\r\nbreak out in dance and music; how her exuberance has the aspect of the\r\nfulness of self-abandonment, and not a mere dissipation of display. You\r\nhave discovered that nature reserves her power in forms of beauty; and\r\nit is this beauty which, like a mother, nourishes all the giant forces\r\nat her breast, keeping them in active vigour, yet in repose. You have\r\nknown that energies of nature save themselves from wearing out by the\r\nrhythm of a perfect grace, and that she with the tenderness of her\r\ncurved lines takes away fatigue from the world's muscles. I have felt\r\nthat you have been able to assimilate these secrets into your life, and\r\nthe truth which lies in the beauty of all things has passed into your\r\nsouls. A mere knowledge of things can be had in a short enough time, but\r\ntheir spirit can only be acquired by centuries of training and\r\nself-control. Dominating nature from outside is a much simpler thing\r\nthan making her your own in love's delight, which is a work of true\r\ngenius. Your race has shown that genius, not by acquirement, but by\r\ncreation; not by display of things, but by manifestation of its own\r\ninner being. This creative power there is in all nations, and it is ever\r\nactive in getting hold of men's natures and giving them a form according\r\nto its ideals. But here, in Japan, it seems to have achieved its\r\nsuccess, and deeply sunk into the minds of all men, and permeated their\r\nmuscles and nerves. Your instincts have become true, your senses keen,\r\nand your hands have acquired natural skill. The genius of Europe has\r\ngiven her people the power of organization, which has specially made\r\nitself manifest in politics and commerce and in co-ordinating scientific\r\nknowledge. The genius of Japan has given you the vision of beauty in\r\nnature and the power of realizing it in your life.\r\n\r\nAll particular civilization is the interpretation of particular human\r\nexperience. Europe seems to have felt emphatically the conflict of\r\nthings in the universe, which can only be brought under control by\r\nconquest. Therefore she is ever ready for fight, and the best portion of\r\nher attention is occupied in organizing forces. But Japan has felt, in\r\nher world, the touch of some presence, which has evoked in her soul a\r\nfeeling of reverent adoration. She does not boast of her mastery of\r\nnature, but to her she brings, with infinite care and joy, her offerings\r\nof love. Her relationship with the world is the deeper relationship of\r\nheart. This spiritual bond of love she has established with the hills of\r\nher country, with the sea and the streams, with the forests in all their\r\nflowery moods and varied physiognomy of branches; she has taken into her\r\nheart all the rustling whispers and sighing of the woodlands and sobbing\r\nof the waves; the sun and the moon she has studied in all the\r\nmodulations of their lights and shades, and she is glad to close her\r\nshops to greet the seasons in her orchards and gardens and cornfields.\r\nThis opening of the heart to the soul of the world is not confined to a\r\nsection of your privileged classes, it is not the forced product of\r\nexotic culture, but it belongs to all your men and women of all\r\nconditions. This experience of your soul, in meeting a personality in\r\nthe heart of the world, has been embodied in your civilization. It is a\r\ncivilization of human relationship. Your duty towards your state has\r\nnaturally assumed the character of filial duty, your nation becoming one\r\nfamily with your Emperor as its head. Your national unity has not been\r\nevolved from the comradeship of arms for defensive and offensive\r\npurpose, or from partnership in raiding adventures, dividing among each\r\nmember the danger and spoils of robbery. It is not an outcome of the\r\nnecessity of organization for some ulterior purpose, but it is an\r\nextension of the family and the obligations of the heart in a wide field\r\nof space and time. The ideal of \"maitri\" is at the bottom of your\r\nculture,--\"maitri\" with men and \"maitri\" with Nature. And the true\r\nexpression of this love is in the language of beauty, which is so\r\nabundantly universal in this land. This is the reason why a stranger,\r\nlike myself, instead of feeling envy or humiliation before these\r\nmanifestations of beauty, these creations of love, feels a readiness to\r\nparticipate in the joy and glory of such revealment of the human heart.\r\n\r\nAnd this has made me all the more apprehensive of the change which\r\nthreatens Japanese civilization, as something like a menace to one's own\r\nperson. For the huge heterogeneity of the modern age, whose only common\r\nbond is usefulness, is nowhere so pitifully exposed against the dignity\r\nand hidden power of reticent beauty as in Japan.\r\n\r\nBut the danger lies in this, that organized ugliness storms the mind and\r\ncarries the day by its mass, by its aggressive persistence, by its power\r\nof mockery directed against the deeper sentiments of heart. Its harsh\r\nobtrusiveness makes it forcibly visible to us, overcoming our\r\nsenses,--and we bring sacrifices to its altar, as does a savage to the\r\nfetich which appears powerful because of its hideousness. Therefore its\r\nrivalry with things that are modest and profound and have the subtle\r\ndelicacy of life is to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that there are men in your country who are not in\r\nsympathy with your inherited ideals; whose object is to gain, and not\r\nto grow. They are loud in their boast that they have modernized Japan.\r\nWhile I agree with them so far as to say that the spirit of the race\r\nshould harmonize with the spirit of the time, I must warn them that\r\nmodernizing is a mere affectation of modernism, just as affectation of\r\npoesy is poetizing. It is nothing but mimicry, only affectation is\r\nlouder than the original, and it is too literal. One must bear in mind\r\nthat those who have the true modern spirit need not modernize, just as\r\nthose who are truly brave are not braggarts. Modernism is not in the\r\ndress of the Europeans; or in the hideous structures, where their\r\nchildren are interned when they take their lessons; or in the square\r\nhouses with flat, straight wall-surfaces, pierced with parallel lines of\r\nwindows, where these people are caged in their lifetime; certainly\r\nmodernism is not in their ladies' bonnets, carrying on them loads of\r\nincongruities. These are not modern, but merely European. True modernism\r\nis freedom of mind, not slavery of taste. It is independence of thought\r\nand action, not tutelage under European schoolmasters. It is science,\r\nbut not its wrong application in life,--a mere imitation of our science\r\nteachers who reduce it into a superstition, absurdly invoking its aid\r\nfor all impossible purposes.\r\n\r\nLife based upon mere science is attractive to some men, because it has\r\nall the characteristics of sport; it feigns seriousness, but is not\r\nprofound. When you go a-hunting, the less pity you have the better; for\r\nyour one object is to chase the game and kill it, to feel that you are\r\nthe greater animal, that your method of destruction is thorough and\r\nscientific. And the life of science is that superficial life. It pursues\r\nsuccess with skill and thoroughness, and takes no account of the higher\r\nnature of man. But those whose minds are crude enough to plan their\r\nlives upon the supposition that man is merely a hunter and his paradise\r\nthe paradise of sportsmen will be rudely awakened in the midst of their\r\ntrophies of skeletons and skulls.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment suggest that Japan should be unmindful of\r\nacquiring modern weapons of self-protection. But this should never be\r\nallowed to go beyond her instinct of self-preservation. She must know\r\nthat the real power is not in the weapons themselves, but in the man who\r\nwields those weapons; and when he, in his eagerness for power,\r\nmultiplies his weapons at the cost of his own soul, then it is he who\r\nis in even greater danger than his enemies.\r\n\r\nThings that are living are so easily hurt; therefore they require\r\nprotection. In nature, life protects itself within its coverings, which\r\nare built with life's own material. Therefore they are in harmony with\r\nlife's growth, or else when the time comes they easily give way and are\r\nforgotten. The living man has his true protection in his spiritual\r\nideals, which have their vital connection with his life and grow with\r\nhis growth. But, unfortunately, all his armour is not living,--some of\r\nit is made of steel, inert and mechanical. Therefore, while making use\r\nof it, man has to be careful to protect himself from its tyranny. If he\r\nis weak enough to grow smaller to fit himself to his covering, then it\r\nbecomes a process of gradual suicide by shrinkage of the soul. And Japan\r\nmust have a firm faith in the moral law of existence to be able to\r\nassert to herself that the Western nations are following that path of\r\nsuicide, where they are smothering their humanity under the immense\r\nweight of organizations in order to keep themselves in power and hold\r\nothers in subjection.\r\n\r\nWhat is dangerous for Japan is, not the imitation of the outer features\r\nof the West, but the acceptance of the motive force of the Western\r\nnationalism as her own. Her social ideals are already showing signs of\r\ndefeat at the hands of politics. I can see her motto, taken from\r\nscience, \"Survival of the Fittest,\" writ large at the entrance of her\r\npresent-day history--the motto whose meaning is, \"Help yourself, and\r\nnever heed what it costs to others\"; the motto of the blind man who only\r\nbelieves in what he can touch, because he cannot see. But those who can\r\nsee know that men are so closely knit that when you strike others the\r\nblow comes back to yourself. The moral law, which is the greatest\r\ndiscovery of man, is the discovery of this wonderful truth, that man\r\nbecomes all the truer the more he realizes himself in others. This truth\r\nhas not only a subjective value, but is manifested in every department\r\nof our life. And nations who sedulously cultivate moral blindness as the\r\ncult of patriotism will end their existence in a sudden and violent\r\ndeath. In past ages we had foreign invasions, but they never touched the\r\nsoul of the people deeply. They were merely the outcome of individual\r\nambitions. The people themselves, being free from the responsibilities\r\nof the baser and more heinous side of those adventures, had all the\r\nadvantage of the heroic and the human disciplines derived from them.\r\nThis developed their unflinching loyalty, their single-minded devotion\r\nto the obligations of honour, their power of complete self-surrender and\r\nfearless acceptance of death and danger. Therefore the ideals, whose\r\nseats were in the hearts of the people, would not undergo any serious\r\nchange owing to the policies adopted by the kings or generals. But now,\r\nwhere the spirit of the Western nationalism prevails, the whole people\r\nis being taught from boyhood to foster hatreds and ambitions by all\r\nkinds of means--by the manufacture of half-truths and untruths in\r\nhistory, by persistent misrepresentation of other races and the culture\r\nof unfavourable sentiments towards them, by setting up memorials of\r\nevents, very often false, which for the sake of humanity should be\r\nspeedily forgotten, thus continually brewing evil menace towards\r\nneighbours and nations other than their own. This is poisoning the very\r\nfountainhead of humanity. It is discrediting the ideals, which were born\r\nof the lives of men who were our greatest and best. It is holding up\r\ngigantic selfishness as the one universal religion for all nations of\r\nthe world. We can take anything else from the hands of science, but not\r\nthis elixir of moral death. Never think for a moment that the hurts you\r\ninflict upon other races will not infect you, or that the enmities you\r\nsow around your homes will be a wall of protection to you for all time\r\nto come. To imbue the minds of a whole people with an abnormal vanity of\r\nits own superiority, to teach it to take pride in its moral callousness\r\nand ill-begotten wealth, to perpetuate humiliation of defeated nations\r\nby exhibiting trophies won from war, and using these in schools in order\r\nto breed in children's minds contempt for others, is imitating the West\r\nwhere she has a festering sore, whose swelling is a swelling of disease\r\neating into its vitality.\r\n\r\nOur food crops, which are necessary for our sustenance, are products of\r\ncenturies of selection and care. But the vegetation, which we have not\r\nto transform into our lives, does not require the patient thoughts of\r\ngenerations. It is not easy to get rid of weeds; but it is easy, by\r\nprocess of neglect, to ruin your food crops and let them revert to their\r\nprimitive state of wildness. Likewise the culture, which has so kindly\r\nadapted itself to your soil--so intimate with life, so human--not only\r\nneeded tilling and weeding in past ages, but still needs anxious work\r\nand watching. What is merely modern--as science and methods of\r\norganization--can be transplanted; but what is vitally human has fibres\r\nso delicate, and roots so numerous and far-reaching, that it dies when\r\nmoved from its soil. Therefore I am afraid of the rude pressure of the\r\npolitical ideals of the West upon your own. In political civilization,\r\nthe state is an abstraction and relationship of men utilitarian. Because\r\nit has no root in sentiments, it is so dangerously easy to handle. Half\r\na century has been enough for you to master this machine; and there are\r\nmen among you whose fondness for it exceeds their love for the living\r\nideals, which were born with the birth of your nation and nursed in your\r\ncenturies. It is like a child who, in the excitement of his play,\r\nimagines he likes his playthings better than his mother.\r\n\r\nWhere man is at his greatest, he is unconscious. Your civilization,\r\nwhose mainspring is the bond of human relationship, has been nourished\r\nin the depth of a healthy life beyond reach of prying self-analysis. But\r\na mere political relationship is all-conscious; it is an eruptive\r\ninflammation of aggressiveness. It has forcibly burst upon your notice.\r\nAnd the time has come when you have to be roused into full\r\nconsciousness of the truth by which you live, so that you may not be\r\ntaken unawares. The past has been God's gift to you; about the present,\r\nyou must make your own choice.\r\n\r\nSo the questions you have to put to yourselves are these--\"Have we read\r\nthe world wrong, and based our relation to it upon an ignorance of human\r\nnature? Is the instinct of the West right, where she builds her national\r\nwelfare behind the barricade of a universal distrust of humanity?\"\r\n\r\nYou must have detected a strong accent of fear whenever the West has\r\ndiscussed the possibility of the rise of an Eastern race. The reason of\r\nit is this, that the power by whose help she thrives is an evil power;\r\nso long as it is held on her own side she can be safe, while the rest of\r\nthe world trembles. The vital ambition of the present civilization of\r\nEurope is to have the exclusive possession of the devil. All her\r\narmaments and diplomacy are directed upon this one object. But these\r\ncostly rituals for invocation of the evil spirit lead through a path of\r\nprosperity to the brink of cataclysm. The furies of terror, which the\r\nWest has let loose upon God's world, come back to threaten herself and\r\ngoad her into preparations of more and more frightfulness; this gives\r\nher no rest, and makes her forget all else but the perils that she\r\ncauses to others and incurs herself. To the worship of this devil of\r\npolitics she sacrifices other countries as victims. She feeds upon their\r\ndead flesh and grows fat upon it, so long as the carcasses remain\r\nfresh,--but they are sure to rot at last, and the dead will take their\r\nrevenge, by spreading pollution far and wide and poisoning the vitality\r\nof the feeder. Japan had all her wealth of humanity, her harmony of\r\nheroism and beauty, her depth of self-control and richness of\r\nself-expression; yet the Western nations felt no respect for her till\r\nshe proved that the bloodhounds of Satan are not only bred in the\r\nkennels of Europe but can also be domesticated in Japan and fed with\r\nman's miseries. They admit Japan's equality with themselves, only when\r\nthey know that Japan also possesses the key to open the floodgate of\r\nhell-fire upon the fair earth whenever she chooses, and can dance, in\r\ntheir own measure, the devil dance of pillage, murder and ravishment of\r\ninnocent women, while the world goes to ruin. We know that, in the early\r\nstage of man's moral immaturity, he only feels reverence for the god\r\nwhose malevolence he dreads. But is this the ideal of man which we can\r\nlook up to with pride? After centuries of civilization nations fearing\r\neach other like the prowling wild beasts of the night-time; shutting\r\ntheir doors of hospitality; combining only for purpose of aggression or\r\ndefence; hiding in their holes their trade secrets, state secrets,\r\nsecrets of their armaments; making peace-offerings to each other's\r\nbarking dogs with the meat which does not belong to them; holding down\r\nfallen races which struggle to stand upon their feet; with their right\r\nhands dispensing religion to weaker peoples, while robbing them with\r\ntheir left,--is there anything in this to make us envious? Are we to\r\nbend our knees to the spirit of this nationalism, which is sowing\r\nbroadcast over all the world seeds of fear, greed, suspicion, unashamed\r\nlies of its diplomacy, and unctuous lies of its profession of peace and\r\ngood-will and universal brotherhood of Man? Can our minds be free from\r\ndoubt when we rush to the Western market to buy this foreign product in\r\nexchange for our own inheritance? I am aware how difficult it is to know\r\none's self; and the man who is intoxicated furiously denies his\r\ndrunkenness; yet the West herself is anxiously thinking of her problems\r\nand trying experiments. But she is like a glutton, who has not the\r\nheart to give up his intemperance in eating, and fondly clings to the\r\nhope that he can cure his nightmares of indigestion by medicine. Europe\r\nis not ready to give up her political inhumanity, with all the baser\r\npassions of man attendant upon it; she believes only in modification of\r\nsystems, and not in change of heart.\r\n\r\nWe are willing to buy their machine-made systems, not with our hearts,\r\nbut with our brains. We shall try them and build sheds for them, but not\r\nenshrine them in our homes or temples. There are races who worship the\r\nanimals they kill; we can buy meat from them when we are hungry, but not\r\nthe worship which goes with the killing. We must not vitiate our\r\nchildren's minds with the superstition that business is business, war is\r\nwar, politics is politics. We must know that man's business has to be\r\nmore than mere business, and so should be his war and politics. You had\r\nyour own industry in Japan; how scrupulously honest and true it was, you\r\ncan see by its products,--by their grace and strength, their\r\nconscientiousness in details, where they can hardly be observed. But the\r\ntidal wave of falsehood has swept over your land from that part of the\r\nworld where business is business, and honesty is followed merely as the\r\nbest policy. Have you never felt shame when you see the trade\r\nadvertisements, not only plastering the whole town with lies and\r\nexaggerations, but invading the green fields, where the peasants do\r\ntheir honest labour, and the hill-tops, which greet the first pure light\r\nof the morning? It is so easy to dull our sense of honour and delicacy\r\nof mind with constant abrasion, while falsehoods stalk abroad with proud\r\nsteps in the name of trade, politics and patriotism, that any protest\r\nagainst their perpetual intrusion into our lives is considered to be\r\nsentimentalism, unworthy of true manliness.\r\n\r\nAnd it has come to pass that the children of those heroes who would keep\r\ntheir word at the point of death, who would disdain to cheat men for\r\nvulgar profit, who even in their fight would much rather court defeat\r\nthan be dishonourable, have become energetic in dealing with falsehoods\r\nand do not feel humiliated by gaining advantage from them. And this has\r\nbeen effected by the charm of the word \"modern.\" But if undiluted\r\nutility be modern, beauty is of all ages; if mean selfishness be modern,\r\nthe human ideals are no new inventions. And we must know for certain\r\nthat however modern may be the proficiency which cripples man for the\r\nsake of methods and machines, it will never live to be old.\r\n\r\nBut while trying to free our minds from the arrogant claims of Europe\r\nand to help ourselves out of the quicksands of our infatuation, we may\r\ngo to the other extreme and blind ourselves with a wholesale suspicion\r\nof the West. The reaction of disillusionment is just as unreal as the\r\nfirst shock of illusion. We must try to come to that normal state of\r\nmind by which we can clearly discern our own danger and avoid it without\r\nbeing unjust towards the source of that danger. There is always the\r\nnatural temptation in us of wishing to pay back Europe in her own coin,\r\nand return contempt for contempt and evil for evil. But that again would\r\nbe to imitate Europe in one of her worst features, which comes out in\r\nher behaviour to people whom she describes as yellow or red, brown or\r\nblack. And this is a point on which we in the East have to acknowledge\r\nour guilt and own that our sin has been as great, if not greater, when\r\nwe insulted humanity by treating with utter disdain and cruelty men who\r\nbelonged to a particular creed, colour or caste. It is really because we\r\nare afraid of our own weakness, which allows itself to be overcome by\r\nthe sight of power, that we try to substitute for it another weakness\r\nwhich makes itself blind to the glories of the West. When we truly know\r\nthe Europe which is great and good, we can effectively save ourselves\r\nfrom the Europe which is mean and grasping. It is easy to be unfair in\r\none's judgment when one is faced with human miseries,--and pessimism is\r\nthe result of building theories while the mind is suffering. To despair\r\nof humanity is only possible if we lose faith in truth which brings to\r\nit strength, when its defeat is greatest, and calls out new life from\r\nthe depth of its destruction. We must admit that there is a living soul\r\nin the West which is struggling unobserved against the hugeness of the\r\norganizations under which men, women and children are being crushed, and\r\nwhose mechanical necessities are ignoring laws that are spiritual and\r\nhuman,--the soul whose sensibilities refuse to be dulled completely by\r\ndangerous habits of heedlessness in dealings with races for whom it\r\nlacks natural sympathy. The West could never have risen to the eminence\r\nshe has reached if her strength were merely the strength of the brute or\r\nof the machine. The divine in her heart is suffering from the injuries\r\ninflicted by her hands upon the world,--and from this pain of her higher\r\nnature flows the secret balm which will bring healing to those injuries.\r\nTime after time she has fought against herself and has undone the chains\r\nwhich with her own hands she had fastened round helpless limbs; and\r\nthough she forced poison down the throat of a great nation at the point\r\nof the sword for gain of money, she herself woke up to withdraw from it,\r\nto wash her hands clean again. This shows hidden springs of humanity in\r\nspots which look dead and barren. It proves that the deeper truth in her\r\nnature, which can survive such a career of cruel cowardliness, is not\r\ngreed, but reverence for unselfish ideals. It would be altogether\r\nunjust, both to us and to Europe, to say that she has fascinated the\r\nmodern Eastern mind by the mere exhibition of her power. Through the\r\nsmoke of cannons and dust of markets the light of her moral nature has\r\nshone bright, and she has brought to us the ideal of ethical freedom,\r\nwhose foundation lies deeper than social conventions and whose province\r\nof activity is world-wide.\r\n\r\nThe East has instinctively felt, even through her aversion, that she has\r\na great deal to learn from Europe, not merely about the materials of\r\npower, but about its inner source, which is of mind and of the moral\r\nnature of man. Europe has been teaching us the higher obligations of\r\npublic good above those of the family and the clan, and the sacredness\r\nof law, which makes society independent of individual caprice, secures\r\nfor it continuity of progress, and guarantees justice to all men of all\r\npositions in life. Above all things Europe has held high before our\r\nminds the banner of liberty, through centuries of martyrdom and\r\nachievement,--liberty of conscience, liberty of thought and action,\r\nliberty in the ideals of art and literature. And because Europe has won\r\nour deep respect, she has become so dangerous for us where she is\r\nturbulently weak and false,--dangerous like poison when it is served\r\nalong with our best food. There is one safety for us upon which we hope\r\nwe may count, and that is, that we can claim Europe herself as our ally\r\nin our resistance to her temptations and to her violent encroachments;\r\nfor she has ever carried her own standard of perfection, by which we can\r\nmeasure her falls and gauge her degrees of failure, by which we can call\r\nher before her own tribunal and put her to shame,--the shame which is\r\nthe sign of the true pride of nobleness.\r\n\r\nBut our fear is, that the poison may be more powerful than the food,\r\nand what is strength in her to-day may not be the sign of health, but\r\nthe contrary; for it may be temporarily caused by the upsetting of the\r\nbalance of life. Our fear is that evil has a fateful fascination when it\r\nassumes dimensions which are colossal,--and though at last it is sure to\r\nlose its centre of gravity by its abnormal disproportion, the mischief\r\nwhich it creates before its fall may be beyond reparation.\r\n\r\nTherefore I ask you to have the strength of faith and clarity of mind to\r\nknow for certain that the lumbering structure of modern progress,\r\nriveted by the iron bolts of efficiency, which runs upon the wheels of\r\nambition, cannot hold together for long. Collisions are certain to\r\noccur; for it has to travel upon organized lines, it is too heavy to\r\nchoose its own course freely; and once it is off the rails, its endless\r\ntrain of vehicles is dislocated. A day will come when it will fall in a\r\nheap of ruin and cause serious obstruction to the traffic of the world.\r\nDo we not see signs of this even now? Does not the voice come to us,\r\nthrough the din of war, the shrieks of hatred, the wailings of despair,\r\nthrough the churning up of the unspeakable filth which has been\r\naccumulating for ages in the bottom of this nationalism,--the voice\r\nwhich cries to our soul that the tower of national selfishness, which\r\ngoes by the name of patriotism, which has raised its banner of treason\r\nagainst heaven, must totter and fall with a crash, weighed down by its\r\nown bulk, its flag kissing the dust, its light extinguished? My\r\nbrothers, when the red light of conflagration sends up its crackle of\r\nlaughter to the stars, keep your faith upon those stars and not upon the\r\nfire of destruction. For when this conflagration consumes itself and\r\ndies down, leaving its memorial in ashes, the eternal light will again\r\nshine in the East,--the East which has been the birthplace of the\r\nmorning sun of man's history. And who knows if that day has not already\r\ndawned, and the sun not risen, in the Easternmost horizon of Asia? And I\r\noffer, as did my ancestor rishis, my salutation to that sunrise of the\r\nEast, which is destined once again to illumine the whole world.\r\n\r\nI know my voice is too feeble to raise itself above the uproar of this\r\nbustling time, and it is easy for any street urchin to fling against me\r\nthe epithet of \"unpractical.\" It will stick to my coat-tail, never to be\r\nwashed away, effectively excluding me from the consideration of all\r\nrespectable persons. I know what a risk one runs from the vigorously\r\nathletic crowds in being styled an idealist in these days, when thrones\r\nhave lost their dignity and prophets have become an anachronism, when\r\nthe sound that drowns all voices is the noise of the market-place. Yet\r\nwhen, one day, standing on the outskirts of Yokohama town, bristling\r\nwith its display of modern miscellanies, I watched the sunset in your\r\nsouthern sea, and saw its peace and majesty among your pine-clad\r\nhills,--with the great Fujiyama growing faint against the golden\r\nhorizon, like a god overcome with his own radiance,--the music of\r\neternity welled up through the evening silence, and I felt that the sky\r\nand the earth and the lyrics of the dawn and the dayfall are with the\r\npoets and idealists, and not with the marketmen robustly contemptuous of\r\nall sentiment,--that, after the forgetfulness of his own divinity, man\r\nwill remember again that heaven is always in touch with his world, which\r\ncan never be abandoned for good to the hounding wolves of the modern\r\nera, scenting human blood and howling to the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONALISM IN INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nOur real problem in India is not political. It is social. This is a\r\ncondition not only prevailing in India, but among all nations. I do not\r\nbelieve in an exclusive political interest. Politics in the West have\r\ndominated Western ideals, and we in India are trying to imitate you. We\r\nhave to remember that in Europe, where peoples had their racial unity\r\nfrom the beginning, and where natural resources were insufficient for\r\nthe inhabitants, the civilization has naturally taken the character of\r\npolitical and commercial aggressiveness. For on the one hand they had no\r\ninternal complications, and on the other they had to deal with\r\nneighbours who were strong and rapacious. To have perfect combination\r\namong themselves and a watchful attitude of animosity against others was\r\ntaken as the solution of their problems. In former days they organized\r\nand plundered, in the present age the same spirit continues--and they\r\norganize and exploit the whole world.\r\n\r\nBut from the earliest beginnings of history India has had her own\r\nproblem constantly before her--it is the race problem. Each nation must\r\nbe conscious of its mission, and we, in India, must realize that we cut\r\na poor figure when we are trying to be political, simply because we have\r\nnot yet been finally able to accomplish what was set before us by our\r\nprovidence.\r\n\r\nThis problem of race unity which we have been trying to solve for so\r\nmany years has likewise to be faced by you here in America. Many people\r\nin this country ask me what is happening as to the caste distinctions in\r\nIndia. But when this question is asked me, it is usually done with a\r\nsuperior air. And I feel tempted to put the same question to our\r\nAmerican critics with a slight modification, \"What have you done with\r\nthe Red Indian and the Negro?\" For you have not got over your attitude\r\nof caste toward them. You have used violent methods to keep aloof from\r\nother races, but until you have solved the question here in America, you\r\nhave no right to question India.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our great difficulty, however, India has done something. She\r\nhas tried to make an adjustment of races, to acknowledge the real\r\ndifferences between them where these exist, and yet seek for some basis\r\nof unity. This basis has come through our saints, like Nanak, Kabir,\r\nChaitnaya and others, preaching one God to all races of India.\r\n\r\nIn finding the solution of our problem we shall have helped to solve the\r\nworld problem as well. What India has been, the whole world is now. The\r\nwhole world is becoming one country through scientific facility. And the\r\nmoment is arriving when you also must find a basis of unity which is not\r\npolitical. If India can offer to the world her solution, it will be a\r\ncontribution to humanity. There is only one history--the history of man.\r\nAll national histories are merely chapters in the larger one. And we are\r\ncontent in India to suffer for such a great cause.\r\n\r\nEach individual has his self-love. Therefore his brute instinct leads\r\nhim to fight with others in the sole pursuit of his self-interest. But\r\nman has also his higher instincts of sympathy and mutual help. The\r\npeople who are lacking in this higher moral power and who therefore\r\ncannot combine in fellowship with one another must perish or live in a\r\nstate of degradation. Only those peoples have survived and achieved\r\ncivilization who have this spirit of co-operation strong in them. So we\r\nfind that from the beginning of history men had to choose between\r\nfighting with one another and combining, between serving their own\r\ninterest or the common interest of all.\r\n\r\nIn our early history, when the geographical limits of each country and\r\nalso the facilities of communication were small, this problem was\r\ncomparatively small in dimension. It was sufficient for men to develop\r\ntheir sense of unity within their area of segregation. In those days\r\nthey combined among themselves and fought against others. But it was\r\nthis moral spirit of combination which was the true basis of their\r\ngreatness, and this fostered their art, science and religion. At that\r\nearly time the most important fact that man had to take count of was the\r\nfact of the members of one particular race of men coming in close\r\ncontact with one another. Those who truly grasped this fact through\r\ntheir higher nature made their mark in history.\r\n\r\nThe most important fact of the present age is that all the different\r\nraces of men have come close together. And again we are confronted with\r\ntwo alternatives. The problem is whether the different groups of peoples\r\nshall go on fighting with one another or find out some true basis of\r\nreconciliation and mutual help; whether it will be interminable\r\ncompetition or co-operation.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in saying that those who are gifted with the moral\r\npower of love and vision of spiritual unity, who have the least feeling\r\nof enmity against aliens, and the sympathetic insight to place\r\nthemselves in the position of others, will be the fittest to take their\r\npermanent place in the age that is lying before us, and those who are\r\nconstantly developing their instinct of fight and intolerance of aliens\r\nwill be eliminated. For this is the problem before us, and we have to\r\nprove our humanity by solving it through the help of our higher nature.\r\nThe gigantic organizations for hurting others and warding off their\r\nblows, for making money by dragging others back, will not help us. On\r\nthe contrary, by their crushing weight, their enormous cost and their\r\ndeadening effect upon living humanity, they will seriously impede our\r\nfreedom in the larger life of a higher civilization.\r\n\r\nDuring the evolution of the Nation the moral culture of brotherhood was\r\nlimited by geographical boundaries, because at that time those\r\nboundaries were true. Now they have become imaginary lines of tradition\r\ndivested of the qualities of real obstacles. So the time has come when\r\nman's moral nature must deal with this great fact with all seriousness\r\nor perish. The first impulse of this change of circumstance has been the\r\nchurning up of man's baser passions of greed and cruel hatred. If this\r\npersists indefinitely, and armaments go on exaggerating themselves to\r\nunimaginable absurdities, and machines and storehouses envelop this fair\r\nearth with their dirt and smoke and ugliness, then it will end in a\r\nconflagration of suicide. Therefore man will have to exert all his power\r\nof love and clarity of vision to make another great moral adjustment\r\nwhich will comprehend the whole world of men and not merely the\r\nfractional groups of nationality. The call has come to every individual\r\nin the present age to prepare himself and his surroundings for this dawn\r\nof a new era, when man shall discover his soul in the spiritual unity of\r\nall human beings.\r\n\r\nIf it is given at all to the West to struggle out of these tangles of\r\nthe lower slopes to the spiritual summit of humanity then I cannot but\r\nthink that it is the special mission of America to fulfil this hope of\r\nGod and man. You are the country of expectation, desiring something else\r\nthan what is. Europe has her subtle habits of mind and her conventions.\r\nBut America, as yet, has come to no conclusions. I realize how much\r\nAmerica is untrammelled by the traditions of the past, and I can\r\nappreciate that experimentalism is a sign of America's youth. The\r\nfoundation of her glory is in the future, rather than in the past; and\r\nif one is gifted with the power of clairvoyance, one will be able to\r\nlove the America that is to be.\r\n\r\nAmerica is destined to justify Western civilization to the East. Europe\r\nhas lost faith in humanity, and has become distrustful and sickly.\r\nAmerica, on the other hand, is not pessimistic or blasé. You know, as a\r\npeople, that there is such a thing as a better and a best; and that\r\nknowledge drives you on. There are habits that are not merely passive\r\nbut aggressively arrogant. They are not like mere walls, but are like\r\nhedges of stinging nettles. Europe has been cultivating these hedges of\r\nhabits for long years, till they have grown round her dense and strong\r\nand high. The pride of her traditions has sent its roots deep into her\r\nheart. I do not wish to contend that it is unreasonable. But pride in\r\nevery form breeds blindness at the end. Like all artificial stimulants\r\nits first effect is a heightening of consciousness, and then with the\r\nincreasing dose it muddles it and brings an exultation that is\r\nmisleading. Europe has gradually grown hardened in her pride in all her\r\nouter and inner habits. She not only cannot forget that she is Western,\r\nbut she takes every opportunity to hurl this fact against others to\r\nhumiliate them. This is why she is growing incapable of imparting to the\r\nEast what is best in herself, and of accepting in a right spirit the\r\nwisdom that the East has stored for centuries.\r\n\r\nIn America national habits and traditions have not had time to spread\r\ntheir clutching roots round your hearts. You have constantly felt and\r\ncomplained of your disadvantages when you compared your nomadic\r\nrestlessness with the settled traditions of Europe--the Europe which can\r\nshow her picture of greatness to the best advantage because she can fix\r\nit against the background of the Past. But in this present age of\r\ntransition, when a new era of civilization is sending its trumpet-call\r\nto all peoples of the world across an unlimited future, this very\r\nfreedom of detachment will enable you to accept its invitation and to\r\nachieve the goal for which Europe began her journey but lost herself\r\nmidway. For she was tempted out of her path by her pride of power and\r\ngreed of possession.\r\n\r\nNot merely your freedom from habits of mind in individuals, but also\r\nthe freedom of your history from all unclean entanglements, fits you in\r\nyour career of holding the banner of civilization of the future. All the\r\ngreat nations of Europe have their victims in other parts of the world.\r\nThis not only deadens their moral sympathy but also their intellectual\r\nsympathy, which is so necessary for the understanding of races which are\r\ndifferent from one's own. Englishmen can never truly understand India,\r\nbecause their minds are not disinterested with regard to that country.\r\nIf you compare England with Germany or France you will find she has\r\nproduced the smallest number of scholars who have studied Indian\r\nliterature and philosophy with any amount of sympathetic insight or\r\nthoroughness. This attitude of apathy and contempt is natural where the\r\nrelationship is abnormal and founded upon national selfishness and\r\npride. But your history has been disinterested, and that is why you have\r\nbeen able to help Japan in her lessons in Western civilization, and that\r\nis why China can look upon you with her best confidence in this her\r\ndarkest period of danger. In fact you are carrying all the\r\nresponsibility of a great future because you are untrammelled by the\r\ngrasping miserliness of a past. Therefore of all countries of the earth\r\nAmerica has to be fully conscious of this future, her vision must not be\r\nobscured and her faith in humanity must be strong with the strength of\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nA parallelism exists between America and India--the parallelism of\r\nwelding together into one body various races.\r\n\r\nIn my country we have been seeking to find out something common to all\r\nraces, which will prove their real unity. No nation looking for a mere\r\npolitical or commercial basis of unity will find such a solution\r\nsufficient. Men of thought and power will discover the spiritual unity,\r\nwill realize it, and preach it.\r\n\r\nIndia has never had a real sense of nationalism. Even though from\r\nchildhood I had been taught that idolatry of the Nation is almost better\r\nthan reverence for God and humanity, I believe I have outgrown that\r\nteaching, and it is my conviction that my countrymen will truly gain\r\ntheir India by fighting against the education which teaches them that a\r\ncountry is greater than the ideals of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe educated Indian at present is trying to absorb some lessons from\r\nhistory contrary to the lessons of our ancestors. The East, in fact, is\r\nattempting to take unto itself a history which is not the outcome of its\r\nown living. Japan, for example, thinks she is getting powerful through\r\nadopting Western methods, but, after she has exhausted her inheritance,\r\nonly the borrowed weapons of civilization will remain to her. She will\r\nnot have developed herself from within.\r\n\r\nEurope has her past. Europe's strength therefore lies in her history.\r\nWe, in India, must make up our minds that we cannot borrow other\r\npeople's history, and that if we stifle our own we are committing\r\nsuicide. When you borrow things that do not belong to your life, they\r\nonly serve to crush your life.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore I believe that it does India no good to compete with\r\nWestern civilization in its own field. But we shall be more than\r\ncompensated if, in spite of the insults heaped upon us, we follow our\r\nown destiny.\r\n\r\nThere are lessons which impart information or train our minds for\r\nintellectual pursuits. These are simple and can be acquired and used\r\nwith advantage. But there are others which affect our deeper nature and\r\nchange our direction of life. Before we accept them and pay their value\r\nby selling our own inheritance, we must pause and think deeply. In man's\r\nhistory there come ages of fireworks which dazzle us by their force and\r\nmovement. They laugh not only at our modest household lamps but also at\r\nthe eternal stars. But let us not for that provocation be precipitate in\r\nour desire to dismiss our lamps. Let us patiently bear our present\r\ninsult and realize that these fireworks have splendour but not\r\npermanence, because of the extreme explosiveness which is the cause of\r\ntheir power, and also of their exhaustion. They are spending a fatal\r\nquantity of energy and substance compared to their gain and production.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, our ideals have been evolved through our own history, and even\r\nif we wished we could only make poor fireworks of them, because their\r\nmaterials are different from yours, as is also their moral purpose. If\r\nwe cherish the desire of paying our all to buy a political nationality\r\nit will be as absurd as if Switzerland had staked her existence on her\r\nambition to build up a navy powerful enough to compete with that of\r\nEngland. The mistake that we make is in thinking that man's channel of\r\ngreatness is only one--the one which has made itself painfully evident\r\nfor the time being by its depth of insolence.\r\n\r\nWe must know for certain that there is a future before us and that\r\nfuture is waiting for those who are rich in moral ideals and not in mere\r\nthings. And it is the privilege of man to work for fruits that are\r\nbeyond his immediate reach, and to adjust his life not in slavish\r\nconformity to the examples of some present success or even to his own\r\nprudent past, limited in its aspiration, but to an infinite future\r\nbearing in its heart the ideals of our highest expectations.\r\n\r\nWe must recognize that it is providential that the West has come to\r\nIndia. And yet some one must show the East to the West, and convince the\r\nWest that the East has her contribution to make to the history of\r\ncivilization. India is no beggar of the West. And yet even though the\r\nWest may think she is, I am not for thrusting off Western civilization\r\nand becoming segregated in our independence. Let us have a deep\r\nassociation. If Providence wants England to be the channel of that\r\ncommunication, of that deeper association, I am willing to accept it\r\nwith all humility. I have great faith in human nature, and I think the\r\nWest will find its true mission. I speak bitterly of Western\r\ncivilization when I am conscious that it is betraying its trust and\r\nthwarting its own purpose. The West must not make herself a curse to the\r\nworld by using her power for her own selfish needs, but, by teaching the\r\nignorant and helping the weak, she should save herself from the worst\r\ndanger that the strong is liable to incur by making the feeble acquire\r\npower enough to resist her intrusion. And also she must not make her\r\nmaterialism to be the final thing, but must realize that she is doing a\r\nservice in freeing the spiritual being from the tyranny of matter.\r\n\r\nI am not against one nation in particular, but against the general idea\r\nof all nations. What is the Nation?\r\n\r\nIt is the aspect of a whole people as an organized power. This\r\norganization incessantly keeps up the insistence of the population on\r\nbecoming strong and efficient. But this strenuous effort after strength\r\nand efficiency drains man's energy from his higher nature where he is\r\nself-sacrificing and creative. For thereby man's power of sacrifice is\r\ndiverted from his ultimate object, which is moral, to the maintenance of\r\nthis organization, which is mechanical. Yet in this he feels all the\r\nsatisfaction of moral exaltation and therefore becomes supremely\r\ndangerous to humanity. He feels relieved of the urging of his conscience\r\nwhen he can transfer his responsibility to this machine which is the\r\ncreation of his intellect and not of his complete moral personality. By\r\nthis device the people which loves freedom perpetuates slavery in a\r\nlarge portion of the world with the comfortable feeling of pride of\r\nhaving done its duty; men who are naturally just can be cruelly unjust\r\nboth in their act and their thought, accompanied by a feeling that they\r\nare helping the world to receive its deserts; men who are honest can\r\nblindly go on robbing others of their human rights for\r\nself-aggrandizement, all the while abusing the deprived for not\r\ndeserving better treatment. We have seen in our everyday life even small\r\norganizations of business and profession produce callousness of feeling\r\nin men who are not naturally bad, and we can well imagine what a moral\r\nhavoc it is causing in a world where whole peoples are furiously\r\norganizing themselves for gaining wealth and power.\r\n\r\nNationalism is a great menace. It is the particular thing which for\r\nyears has been at the bottom of India's troubles. And inasmuch as we\r\nhave been ruled and dominated by a nation that is strictly political in\r\nits attitude, we have tried to develop within ourselves, despite our\r\ninheritance from the past, a belief in our eventual political destiny.\r\n\r\nThere are different parties in India, with different ideals. Some are\r\nstruggling for political independence. Others think that the time has\r\nnot arrived for that, and yet believe that India should have the rights\r\nthat the English colonies have. They wish to gain autonomy as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the history of political agitation in India there\r\nwas not the conflict between parties which there is to-day. At that time\r\nthere was a party known as the Indian Congress; it had no real\r\nprogramme. They had a few grievances for redress by the authorities.\r\nThey wanted larger representation in the Council House, and more freedom\r\nin Municipal government. They wanted scraps of things, but they had no\r\nconstructive ideal. Therefore I was lacking in enthusiasm for their\r\nmethods. It was my conviction that what India most needed was\r\nconstructive work coming from within herself. In this work we must take\r\nall risks and go on doing the duties which by right are ours, though in\r\nthe teeth of persecution; winning moral victory at every step, by our\r\nfailure and suffering. We must show those who are over us that we have\r\nin ourselves the strength of moral power, the power to suffer for truth.\r\nWhere we have nothing to show, we have only to beg. It would be\r\nmischievous if the gifts we wish for were granted to us at once, and I\r\nhave told my countrymen, time and again, to combine for the work of\r\ncreating opportunities to give vent to our spirit of self-sacrifice, and\r\nnot for the purpose of begging.\r\n\r\nThe party, however, lost power because the people soon came to realize\r\nhow futile was the half policy adopted by them. The party split, and\r\nthere arrived the Extremists, who advocated independence of action, and\r\ndiscarded the begging method,--the easiest method of relieving one's\r\nmind from his responsibility towards his country. Their ideals were\r\nbased on Western history. They had no sympathy with the special problems\r\nof India. They did not recognize the patent fact that there were causes\r\nin our social organization which made the Indian incapable of coping\r\nwith the alien. What should we do if, for any reason, England was driven\r\naway? We should simply be victims for other nations. The same social\r\nweaknesses would prevail. The thing we in India have to think of is\r\nthis--to remove those social customs and ideals which have generated a\r\nwant of self-respect and a complete dependence on those above us,--a\r\nstate of affairs which has been brought about entirely by the domination\r\nin India of the caste system, and the blind and lazy habit of relying\r\nupon the authority of traditions that are incongruous anachronisms in\r\nthe present age.\r\n\r\nOnce again I draw your attention to the difficulties India has had to\r\nencounter and her struggle to overcome them. Her problem was the problem\r\nof the world in miniature. India is too vast in its area and too diverse\r\nin its races. It is many countries packed in one geographical\r\nreceptacle. It is just the opposite of what Europe truly is, namely, one\r\ncountry made into many. Thus Europe in its culture and growth has had\r\nthe advantage of the strength of the many as well as the strength of the\r\none. India, on the contrary, being naturally many, yet adventitiously\r\none, has all along suffered from the looseness of its diversity and the\r\nfeebleness of its unity. A true unity is like a round globe, it rolls\r\non, carrying its burden easily; but diversity is a many-cornered thing\r\nwhich has to be dragged and pushed with all force. Be it said to the\r\ncredit of India that this diversity was not her own creation; she has\r\nhad to accept it as a fact from the beginning of her history. In America\r\nand Australia, Europe has simplified her problem by almost exterminating\r\nthe original population. Even in the present age this spirit of\r\nextermination is making itself manifest, in the inhospitable shutting\r\nout of aliens, by those who themselves were aliens in the lands they now\r\noccupy. But India tolerated difference of races from the first, and that\r\nspirit of toleration has acted all through her history.\r\n\r\nHer caste system is the outcome of this spirit of toleration. For India\r\nhas all along been trying experiments in evolving a social unity within\r\nwhich all the different peoples could be held together, while fully\r\nenjoying the freedom of maintaining their own differences. The tie has\r\nbeen as loose as possible, yet as close as the circumstances permitted.\r\nThis has produced something like a United States of a social federation,\r\nwhose common name is Hinduism.\r\n\r\nIndia had felt that diversity of races there must be and should be,\r\nwhatever may be its drawback, and you can never coerce nature into your\r\nnarrow limits of convenience without paying one day very dearly for it.\r\nIn this India was right; but what she failed to realize was that in\r\nhuman beings differences are not like the physical barriers of\r\nmountains, fixed for ever--they are fluid with life's flow, they are\r\nchanging their courses and their shapes and volume.\r\n\r\nTherefore in her caste regulations India recognized differences, but not\r\nthe mutability which is the law of life. In trying to avoid collisions\r\nshe set up boundaries of immovable walls, thus giving to her numerous\r\nraces the negative benefit of peace and order but not the positive\r\nopportunity of expansion and movement. She accepted nature where it\r\nproduces diversity, but ignored it where it uses that diversity for its\r\nworld-game of infinite permutations and combinations. She treated life\r\nin all truth where it is manifold, but insulted it where it is ever\r\nmoving. Therefore Life departed from her social system and in its place\r\nshe is worshipping with all ceremony the magnificent cage of countless\r\ncompartments that she has manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened where she tried to ward off the collisions of\r\ntrade interests. She associated different trades and professions with\r\ndifferent castes. This had the effect of allaying for good the\r\ninterminable jealousy and hatred of competition--the competition which\r\nbreeds cruelty and makes the atmosphere thick with lies and deception.\r\nIn this also India laid all her emphasis upon the law of heredity,\r\nignoring the law of mutation, and thus gradually reduced arts into\r\ncrafts and genius into skill.\r\n\r\nHowever, what Western observers fail to discern is that in her caste\r\nsystem India in all seriousness accepted her responsibility to solve the\r\nrace problem in such a manner as to avoid all friction, and yet to\r\nafford each race freedom within its boundaries. Let us admit India has\r\nnot in this achieved a full measure of success. But this you must also\r\nconcede, that the West, being more favourably situated as to homogeneity\r\nof races, has never given her attention to this problem, and whenever\r\nconfronted with it she has tried to make it easy by ignoring it\r\naltogether. And this is the source of her anti-Asiatic agitations for\r\ndepriving aliens of their right to earn their honest living on these\r\nshores. In most of your colonies you only admit them on condition of\r\ntheir accepting the menial position of hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater. Either you shut your doors against the aliens or reduce them into\r\nslavery. And this is your solution of the problem of race-conflict.\r\nWhatever may be its merits you will have to admit that it does not\r\nspring from the higher impulses of civilization, but from the lower\r\npassions of greed and hatred. You say this is human nature--and India\r\nalso thought she knew human nature when she strongly barricaded her race\r\ndistinctions by the fixed barriers of social gradations. But we have\r\nfound out to our cost that human nature is not what it seems, but what\r\nit is in truth; which is in its infinite possibilities. And when we in\r\nour blindness insult humanity for its ragged appearance it sheds its\r\ndisguise to disclose to us that we have insulted our God. The\r\ndegradation which we cast upon others in our pride or self-interest\r\ndegrades our own humanity--and this is the punishment which is most\r\nterrible, because we do not detect it till it is too late.\r\n\r\nNot only in your relation with aliens but with the different sections of\r\nyour own society you have not achieved harmony of reconciliation. The\r\nspirit of conflict and competition is allowed the full freedom of its\r\nreckless career. And because its genesis is the greed of wealth and\r\npower it can never come to any other end but to a violent death. In\r\nIndia the production of commodities was brought under the law of social\r\nadjustments. Its basis was co-operation, having for its object the\r\nperfect satisfaction of social needs. But in the West it is guided by\r\nthe impulse of competition, whose end is the gain of wealth for\r\nindividuals. But the individual is like the geometrical line; it is\r\nlength without breadth. It has not got the depth to be able to hold\r\nanything permanently. Therefore its greed or gain can never come to\r\nfinality. In its lengthening process of growth it can cross other lines\r\nand cause entanglements, but will ever go on missing the ideal of\r\ncompleteness in its thinness of isolation.\r\n\r\nIn all our physical appetites we recognize a limit. We know that to\r\nexceed that limit is to exceed the limit of health. But has this lust\r\nfor wealth and power no bounds beyond which is death's dominion? In\r\nthese national carnivals of materialism are not the Western peoples\r\nspending most of their vital energy in merely producing things and\r\nneglecting the creation of ideals? And can a civilization ignore the law\r\nof moral health and go on in its endless process of inflation by gorging\r\nupon material things? Man in his social ideals naturally tries to\r\nregulate his appetites, subordinating them to the higher purpose of his\r\nnature. But in the economic world our appetites follow no other\r\nrestrictions but those of supply and demand which can be artificially\r\nfostered, affording individuals opportunities for indulgence in an\r\nendless feast of grossness. In India our social instincts imposed\r\nrestrictions upon our appetites,--maybe it went to the extreme of\r\nrepression,--but in the West the spirit of economic organization with no\r\nmoral purpose goads the people into the perpetual pursuit of wealth; but\r\nhas this no wholesome limit?\r\n\r\nThe ideals that strive to take form in social institutions have two\r\nobjects. One is to regulate our passions and appetites for the\r\nharmonious development of man, and the other is to help him to cultivate\r\ndisinterested love for his fellow-creatures. Therefore society is the\r\nexpression of those moral and spiritual aspirations of man which belong\r\nto his higher nature.\r\n\r\nOur food is creative, it builds our body; but not so wine, which\r\nstimulates. Our social ideals create the human world, but when our mind\r\nis diverted from them to greed of power then in that state of\r\nintoxication we live in a world of abnormality where our strength is not\r\nhealth and our liberty is not freedom. Therefore political freedom does\r\nnot give us freedom when our mind is not free. An automobile does not\r\ncreate freedom of movement, because it is a mere machine. When I myself\r\nam free I can use the automobile for the purpose of my freedom.\r\n\r\nWe must never forget in the present day that those people who have got\r\ntheir political freedom are not necessarily free, they are merely\r\npowerful. The passions which are unbridled in them are creating huge\r\norganizations of slavery in the disguise of freedom. Those who have made\r\nthe gain of money their highest end are unconsciously selling their life\r\nand soul to rich persons or to the combinations that represent money.\r\nThose who are enamoured of their political power and gloat over their\r\nextension of dominion over foreign races gradually surrender their own\r\nfreedom and humanity to the organizations necessary for holding other\r\npeoples in slavery. In the so-called free countries the majority of the\r\npeople are not free, they are driven by the minority to a goal which is\r\nnot even known to them. This becomes possible only because people do not\r\nacknowledge moral and spiritual freedom as their object. They create\r\nhuge eddies with their passions, and they feel dizzily inebriated with\r\nthe mere velocity of their whirling movement, taking that to be freedom.\r\nBut the doom which is waiting to overtake them is as certain as\r\ndeath--for man's truth is moral truth and his emancipation is in the\r\nspiritual life.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion of the majority of the present-day nationalists in\r\nIndia is that we have come to a final completeness in our social and\r\nspiritual ideals, the task of the constructive work of society having\r\nbeen done several thousand years before we were born, and that now we\r\nare free to employ all our activities in the political direction. We\r\nnever dream of blaming our social inadequacy as the origin of our\r\npresent helplessness, for we have accepted as the creed of our\r\nnationalism that this social system has been perfected for all time to\r\ncome by our ancestors, who had the superhuman vision of all eternity and\r\nsupernatural power for making infinite provision for future ages.\r\nTherefore, for all our miseries and shortcomings, we hold responsible\r\nthe historical surprises that burst upon us from outside. This is the\r\nreason why we think that our one task is to build a political miracle of\r\nfreedom upon the quicksand of social slavery. In fact we want to dam up\r\nthe true course of our own historical stream, and only borrow power from\r\nthe sources of other peoples' history.\r\n\r\nThose of us in India who have come under the delusion that mere\r\npolitical freedom will make us free have accepted their lessons from the\r\nWest as the gospel truth and lost their faith in humanity. We must\r\nremember whatever weakness we cherish in our society will become the\r\nsource of danger in politics. The same inertia which leads us to our\r\nidolatry of dead forms in social institutions will create in our\r\npolitics prison-houses with immovable walls. The narrowness of sympathy\r\nwhich makes it possible for us to impose upon a considerable portion of\r\nhumanity the galling yoke of inferiority will assert itself in our\r\npolitics in creating the tyranny of injustice.\r\n\r\nWhen our nationalists talk about ideals they forget that the basis of\r\nnationalism is wanting. The very people who are upholding these ideals\r\nare themselves the most conservative in their social practice.\r\nNationalists say, for example, look at Switzerland where, in spite of\r\nrace differences, the peoples have solidified into a nation. Yet,\r\nremember that in Switzerland the races can mingle, they can intermarry,\r\nbecause they are of the same blood. In India there is no common\r\nbirthright. And when we talk of Western Nationality we forget that the\r\nnations there do not have that physical repulsion, one for the other,\r\nthat we have between different castes. Have we an instance in the whole\r\nworld where a people who are not allowed to mingle their blood shed\r\ntheir blood for one another except by coercion or for mercenary\r\npurposes? And can we ever hope that these moral barriers against our\r\nrace amalgamation will not stand in the way of our political unity?\r\n\r\nThen again we must give full recognition to this fact that our social\r\nrestrictions are still tyrannical, so much so as to make men cowards. If\r\na man tells me he has heterodox ideas, but that he cannot follow them\r\nbecause he would be socially ostracized, I excuse him for having to live\r\na life of untruth, in order to live at all. The social habit of mind\r\nwhich impels us to make the life of our fellow-beings a burden to them\r\nwhere they differ from us even in such a thing as their choice of food,\r\nis sure to persist in our political organization and result in creating\r\nengines of coercion to crush every rational difference which is the sign\r\nof life. And tyranny will only add to the inevitable lies and hypocrisy\r\nin our political life. Is the mere name of freedom so valuable that we\r\nshould be willing to sacrifice for its sake our moral freedom?\r\n\r\nThe intemperance of our habits does not immediately show its effects\r\nwhen we are in the vigour of our youth. But it gradually consumes that\r\nvigour, and when the period of decline sets in then we have to settle\r\naccounts and pay off our debts, which leads us to insolvency. In the\r\nWest you are still able to carry your head high, though your humanity is\r\nsuffering every moment from its dipsomania of organizing power. India\r\nalso in the heyday of her youth could carry in her vital organs the dead\r\nweight of her social organizations stiffened to rigid perfection, but it\r\nhas been fatal to her, and has produced a gradual paralysis of her\r\nliving nature. And this is the reason why the educated community of\r\nIndia has become insensible of her social needs. They are taking the\r\nvery immobility of our social structures as the sign of their\r\nperfection,--and because the healthy feeling of pain is dead in the\r\nlimbs of our social organism they delude themselves into thinking that\r\nit needs no ministration. Therefore they think that all their energies\r\nneed their only scope in the political field. It is like a man whose\r\nlegs have become shrivelled and useless, trying to delude himself that\r\nthese limbs have grown still because they have attained their ultimate\r\nsalvation, and all that is wrong about him is the shortness of his\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\nSo much for the social and the political regeneration of India. Now we\r\ncome to her industries, and I am very often asked whether there is in\r\nIndia any industrial regeneration since the advent of the British\r\nGovernment. It must be remembered that at the beginning of the British\r\nrule in India our industries were suppressed, and since then we have not\r\nmet with any real help or encouragement to enable us to make a stand\r\nagainst the monster commercial organizations of the world. The nations\r\nhave decreed that we must remain purely an agricultural people, even\r\nforgetting the use of arms for all time to come. Thus India is being\r\nturned into so many predigested morsels of food ready to be swallowed at\r\nany moment by any nation which has even the most rudimentary set of\r\nteeth in its head.\r\n\r\nIndia therefore has very little outlet for her industrial originality. I\r\npersonally do not believe in the unwieldy organizations of the present\r\nday. The very fact that they are ugly shows that they are in discordance\r\nwith the whole creation. The vast powers of nature do not reveal their\r\ntruth in hideousness, but in beauty. Beauty is the signature which the\r\nCreator stamps upon His works when He is satisfied with them. All our\r\nproducts that insolently ignore the laws of perfection and are unashamed\r\nin their display of ungainliness bear the perpetual weight of God's\r\ndispleasure. So far as your commerce lacks the dignity of grace it is\r\nuntrue. Beauty and her twin brother Truth require leisure and\r\nself-control for their growth. But the greed of gain has no time or\r\nlimit to its capaciousness. Its one object is to produce and consume. It\r\nhas pity neither for beautiful nature nor for living human beings. It is\r\nruthlessly ready without a moment's hesitation to crush beauty and life\r\nout of them, moulding them into money. It is this ugly vulgarity of\r\ncommerce which brought upon it the censure of contempt in our earlier\r\ndays, when men had leisure to have an unclouded vision of perfection in\r\nhumanity. Men in those times were rightly ashamed of the instinct of\r\nmere money-making. But in this scientific age money, by its very\r\nabnormal bulk, has won its throne. And when from its eminence of\r\npiled-up things it insults the higher instincts of man, banishing beauty\r\nand noble sentiments from its surroundings, we submit. For we in our\r\nmeanness have accepted bribes from its hands and our imagination has\r\ngrovelled in the dust before its immensity of flesh.\r\n\r\nBut its very unwieldiness and its endless complexities are its true\r\nsigns of failure. The swimmer who is an expert does not exhibit his\r\nmuscular force by violent movements, but exhibits some power which is\r\ninvisible and which shows itself in perfect grace and reposefulness. The\r\ntrue distinction of man from animals is in his power and worth which are\r\ninner and invisible. But the present-day commercial civilization of man\r\nis not only taking too much time and space but killing time and space.\r\nIts movements are violent, its noise is discordantly loud. It is\r\ncarrying its own damnation because it is trampling into distortion the\r\nhumanity upon which it stands. It is strenuously turning out money at\r\nthe cost of happiness. Man is reducing himself to his minimum in order\r\nto be able to make amplest room for his organizations. He is deriding\r\nhis human sentiments into shame because they are apt to stand in the way\r\nof his machines.\r\n\r\nIn our mythology we have the legend that the man who performs penances\r\nfor attaining immortality has to meet with temptations sent by Indra,\r\nthe Lord of the immortals. If he is lured by them he is lost. The West\r\nhas been striving for centuries after its goal of immortality. Indra has\r\nsent her the temptation to try her. It is the gorgeous temptation of\r\nwealth. She has accepted it, and her civilization of humanity has lost\r\nits path in the wilderness of machinery.\r\n\r\nThis commercialism with its barbarity of ugly decorations is a terrible\r\nmenace to all humanity, because it is setting up the ideal of power over\r\nthat of perfection. It is making the cult of self-seeking exult in its\r\nnaked shamelessness. Our nerves are more delicate than our muscles.\r\nThings that are the most precious in us are helpless as babes when we\r\ntake away from them the careful protection which they claim from us for\r\ntheir very preciousness. Therefore, when the callous rudeness of power\r\nruns amuck in the broad-way of humanity it scares away by its grossness\r\nthe ideals which we have cherished with the martyrdom of centuries.\r\n\r\nThe temptation which is fatal for the strong is still more so for the\r\nweak. And I do not welcome it in our Indian life, even though it be sent\r\nby the lord of the Immortals. Let our life be simple in its outer aspect\r\nand rich in its inner gain. Let our civilization take its firm stand\r\nupon its basis of social co-operation and not upon that of economic\r\nexploitation and conflict. How to do it in the teeth of the drainage of\r\nour life-blood by the economic dragons is the task set before the\r\nthinkers of all oriental nations who have faith in the human soul. It is\r\na sign of laziness and impotency to accept conditions imposed upon us by\r\nothers who have other ideals than ours. We should actively try to adapt\r\nthe world powers to guide our history to its own perfect end.\r\n\r\nFrom the above you will know that I am not an economist. I am willing to\r\nacknowledge that there is a law of demand and supply and an infatuation\r\nof man for more things than are good for him. And yet I will persist in\r\nbelieving that there is such a thing as the harmony of completeness in\r\nhumanity, where poverty does not take away his riches, where defeat may\r\nlead him to victory, death to immortality, and where in the compensation\r\nof Eternal Justice those who are the last may yet have their insult\r\ntransmuted into a golden triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUNSET OF THE CENTURY\r\n\r\n(_Written in the Bengali on the last day of last century_)\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n     The last sun of the century sets amidst the blood-red clouds of the\r\n       West and the whirlwind of hatred.\r\n     The naked passion of self-love of Nations, in its drunken delirium\r\n       of greed, is dancing to the clash of steel and the howling verses\r\n       of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n     The hungry self of the Nation shall burst in a violence of fury from\r\n       its own shameless feeding.\r\n     For it has made the world its food,\r\n     And licking it, crunching it and swallowing it in big morsels,\r\n             It swells and swells\r\n     Till in the midst of its unholy feast descends the sudden shaft of\r\n       heaven piercing its heart of grossness.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n     The crimson glow of light on the horizon is not the light of thy\r\n       dawn of peace, my Motherland.\r\n     It is the glimmer of the funeral pyre burning to ashes the vast\r\n       flesh,--the self-love of the Nation--dead under its own excess.\r\n     Thy morning waits behind the patient dark of the East,\r\n             Meek and silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n     Keep watch, India.\r\n     Bring your offerings of worship for that sacred sunrise.\r\n     Let the first hymn of its welcome sound in your voice and sing\r\n     \"Come, Peace, thou daughter of God's own great suffering.\r\n     Come with thy treasure of contentment, the sword of fortitude,\r\n             And meekness crowning thy forehead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n     Be not ashamed, my brothers, to stand before the proud and the\r\n       powerful\r\n             With your white robe of simpleness.\r\n     Let your crown be of humility, your freedom the freedom of the\r\n       soul.\r\n     Build God's throne daily upon the ample bareness of your poverty\r\n     And know that what is huge is not great and pride is not\r\n       everlasting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by_ R. & R.

Some little time since\r\nI wrote the story of one of their exploits. The two lads do not\r\nlive a very eventful life even in their hours of recreation. During\r\nthe mid-annual recess I usually choose some delightful spot for our\r\ntemporary home, combining the joint charms of change of scene and\r\nincreased economy. The fashionable watering-place of Drainville-on-Sea\r\nhas a suburb in which apartments may be obtained at a very reasonable\r\nfigure. The reason for this lowness of price is no doubt to be traced\r\nto the fact that many of the residences are in the habitation of the\r\nsuperfluous live stock of a very prosperous pork merchant, having\r\nhis house of business in the neighbourhood. However, in spite of our\r\ndistance from Drainville-on-Sea, my lads have been fairly contented\r\nwith their lot. They have been able to fish, to climb trees, and to\r\ntake long walks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Revered Sir,\" said, on one occasion, GEORGIE, who is\r\ngenerally accepted as the spendthrift of my brace of students, \"it\r\nwould give great pleasure to JACKY if you were kindly to give\r\nme a shilling with which to purchase Japanese caramel cannon-balls. I\r\nhave reasons for believing that his medical attendant, Dr. COFFYN\r\nBLOCKHEAD, considers that this delicious sweetstuff, or, I should\r\nsay, pleasing physic, would be of much benefit to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is the lad ill?\" I asked, with an anxiety tempered with\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\n\"No, revered Sir,\" promptly replied GEORGIE; \"and I fancy\r\nthat Dr. COFFYN BLOCKHEAD regards the composition, which may\r\nbe obtained at a penny the ounce, or two ounces for three halfpence,\r\nrather as a preventative than a curative. Were JACKY to\r\nhave a shilling's-worth, he would not only possess enough to ward\r\noff the shaft of the destroyer himself, but would be able to give\r\nme a sufficient quantity to parry the insidious dart of disease;\r\nand that you might be satisfied that the money was expended in the\r\nlife-protecting compound in question, _I_ would willingly undertake to\r\nmake the purchase.\"\r\n\r\nHere JACKY protested that he was quite old and conscientious\r\nenough to be trusted with the cash himself.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I have any doubt of my respected comrade's probity,\" he\r\nquickly added; \"but in matters of business one cannot be too careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear pupils,\" said I, \"nothing would give me greater pleasure than\r\nto accede to your request, had I the means at hand. I fancy, in spite\r\nof the opinion of Dr. COFFYN BLOCKHEAD--a physician whose name\r\nI now hear for the first time--that I should have to consider the cost\r\nof Japanese caramel cannon-balls as an incident properly chargeable to\r\npocket-money. Unfortunately you both exhausted that fund a fortnight\r\nsince, by causing me to defray the expenses of a donkey ride, which\r\nmounted up in the aggregate to no less an amount than one shilling and\r\neightpence halfpenny.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely, revered Sir,\" suggested GEORGIE, who has a bent\r\nfor mathematics; \"as our parents allow us half-a-sovereign a week each\r\nfor the purposes of recreation, the sum you mention, although not\r\ninconsiderable, would scarcely have----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" I cried, with some show of severity; \"you really must not argue\r\nwith me. I do not give you all your ten shillings a week, as I am\r\nreserving a portion of them to form the nucleus of an old-age pension\r\nto which you will become entitled on reaching eighty. The scheme is not\r\nwithout complications, so I reserve its description in detail until you\r\nare both old enough to understand it. Enough to say that I must repeat\r\nthe present advance of a shilling is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this rebuff the lads were silent, and I regret to say not\r\naltogether contented. However, they soon, with the elasticity of\r\nyouth, regained their spirits, and were as merry and as happy as\r\never. They absented themselves from my society more frequently than\r\nbefore, and when I saw them, seemed to be unusually prosperous, or to\r\nuse an expressive colloquialism, \"flush of money.\" GEORGIE\r\ncontinually appeared in gigantic collars that could have only been\r\nacquired at considerable expense, and JACKY as often carried\r\na new walking-stick with a fairly costly handle. On one occasion they\r\ncame home with a gift for me. It was a mug with a rough sketch of a\r\nmule or some less noble animal on the side balancing the handle, and\r\nwas labelled \"A Present from Drainville-on-Sea.\" I was gratified, but\r\nmy satisfaction savoured of curiosity.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of my pupils I frequently visited the neighbouring\r\nwatering-place. Amongst the many distractions of the sands was one\r\n\"entertainment\" which caused me considerable embarrassment. Two\r\n\"mysterious minstrels\" disguised in wideawakes, blue spectacles, and\r\ncomforters occasionally made what is known as a \"dead set\" at me. These\r\nvocalists (who were small, but noisy), did a roaring trade amongst the\r\nexcursionists. They seemed to have a long _répertoire_ of songs. They\r\nvocally narrated the adventures of a young person from the country,\r\nwho seemingly, with a view to enjoying the restorative effects of\r\nsea-bathing, appeared with \"her hair hanging down her back,\" and the\r\nvagaries of a body of revellers who preferred to parade the streets\r\n\"nine in a row,\" instead of in couples or singly, when they were in a\r\ncondition subsequently recognised by the presiding magistrate with a\r\nfine of five shillings. These ditties were not altogether unamusing,\r\nand I might have enjoyed them had they not been supplemented by a song\r\ndealing personally with myself. This last effort was mere doggerel,\r\nbut it was so insulting that I was forced to give the vocalists into\r\ncustody. I explained that the lines were calculated to cause a breach\r\nof the peace, and the local policeman removed the singers to the\r\nstation-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis last adventure caused me some annoyance, and I returned to my\r\nsuburban lodgings in the hope that in the cheerful conversation\r\nof my charges I might forget my chagrin. Neither GEORGIE\r\nnor JACKY were at home. The hours of dinner, tea, and\r\nsupper passed, and they still put in no appearance. This caused me\r\nconsiderable surprise, as, although not very regular in their habits,\r\nthey were accustomed to pay attention to the fixtures of meal time.\r\nLate in the evening, a police constable called, and explained to me\r\nthat two boys had sent for me, as a householder, to bail them out.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of my narrative is clouded with pain. I would willingly\r\nstop at this point. But, with a view to completeness, I continue. On\r\nreaching the police-station, I learned to my indignation that the\r\n\"mysterious minstrels\" and my charges had the same identity. This\r\ndiscovery will ever be a cause of deep regret to myself, and, I think I\r\nmay add, for very practical and sufficient reasons, to GEORGIE\r\nand JACKY also.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECIPROCITY.\r\n\r\n_Columbia._ \"SORRY THEY ARE PARTING COMPANY AND GOING HOME--THE\r\nCONTEST FOR THE CUP HAD SUCH A LAME CONCLUSION!\"\r\n\r\n_Britannia._ \"WELL, MY DEAR WHOSE FAULT WAS IT?

The Swiftian Ladies alone._\r\n\r\n_Lady Smart._ Well, ladies; now let us have a cup of discourse to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n_Lady Answerall._ Tea and tattle! That is all the men used to think us\r\nfit for.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ But how times have changed--above stairs!\r\n\r\n_Lady Smart._ Fie! Say rather _below_ stairs, Lady SPARKISH.\r\nUp and down are arbitrary or relative terms after all, in the universe.\r\nAnd I'm sure there are no fine drawing-room manners in the modern\r\nmodish world.\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Heigho! Methinks, nevertheless, I would fain take the\r\nair of a London Season once again, however fallen off from the dear\r\ndead days of Mr. SPECTATOR.\r\n\r\n_Lady Answerall._ Hush, child! What would Charon say if he heard you?\r\nThough in truth I am much of your mind myself.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ Better their vivid vulgarity than our vapid gentility!\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ La, yes! Our vaporous \"fine manners\" give me the\r\nvapours.\r\n\r\n_Lady Smart._ They do not have \"vapours\" now, above--well t'other side\r\nthe Styx, let us say.\r\n\r\n_Lady Answerall._ Indeed, no, nothing so simple and womanly, i' faith.\r\n_They_ have substituted neurotic pessimism--and chloral.\r\n\r\n_Lady Smart._ Worse far than our occasional sly sippings of--strong\r\nwaters!\r\n\r\n_Lady Answerall._ What said the dear satiric Dean?\r\n\r\n  \"Now all alone poor madam sits\r\n  In vapours and hysteric fits;\r\n  A dreadful interval of spleen\r\n  How shall we pass the time between?\r\n  Here, BETTY, let me take my drops,\r\n  And feel my pulse, I know it stops;\r\n  This head of mine, lord, how it swims\r\n  And such a pain in all my limbs!\"\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Whereas now it would be:--\r\n\r\n  \"Now sad and sole poor madam lies,\r\n  Insomnia holding wide her eyes:\r\n  'Past ten, and not a single wink.\r\n  Though I turned in at four, I think!\r\n  If I don't get some hours of sleep,\r\n  To-day's appointments can I keep?\r\n  And 'tis the Prince's garden-party!\r\n  Oh! to be buxom, hale, and hearty\r\n  Like some mere milkmaid, who can drowse\r\n  After a frolic and a bowse,\r\n  Upon a tumbled truss of hay!\r\n  I _must_ have sleep. BETTY, I say,\r\n  Bring me the cognac and the choral!'\r\n  --You may supply the modern moral!\"\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ La, child, you are as much a blue-stocking as the\r\nmodish she-scribblers of the century-end. _We_ used to leave all that\r\nsort of thing to Grub Street.\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Tilly-vally! Grub Street has been made genteel since\r\nthe ladies took to haunting it. 'Tis now no shabby Alsatia, but a\r\nswell sanctuary. Faith, one o' these odd-cum-shortlies--as we used to\r\nsay--I'll e'en write \"The Journal of a Modern Lady\" (in imitation of\r\nthe Dean) up-to-date, for 1895, instead of 1728, to wit.\r\n\r\n_Lady Smart._ Have a care, child! Already you simper like a furmety\r\nkettle, and slop over like an ill-made junket. Soon you'll be as smug\r\nand self-conscious as a new member of \"The Souls,\" if you be not\r\nwatchful.\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Well, but now the men are away, what really think you,\r\n_entre nous_, of the New Woman movement?\r\n\r\n_Lady Answerall._ Why, that 'tis older than MARY\r\nWOOLSTONECROFT, and, in fact, originated about the time when\r\nEVE took the first bite at the first apple.\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Heigho! 'Tis fine to sit here in the Shades, and say\r\nso; but I own I should like well enough to ruffle it in new-fangled\r\nclubs and select coteries, to be the talk of the town as APHRA\r\nBEHN was, only in the irreproachable company of popular _savants_\r\nand Bishops' sons; to see my niminy-piminy neuroticisms go into their\r\ntenth edition, have my anti-matrimonial mouthings discussed in monthly\r\nmagazines and religious newspapers, and--have a free slap at the\r\nmonster, Man, whose best voluntary treatment of us means, at bottom,\r\nnothing better than a golden cage and a silken gag.\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ \"Fine words! I wonder where you stole 'em!\"--as the\r\nDean said concerning Chief Justice WHITSHED'S coach-motto.\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Humph! Did he not also say, in dealing with _The\r\nFurniture of a Woman's Mind_--\r\n\r\n  \"For conversation well endued\r\n  She calls it witty to be rude\"?\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ What _do_ you mean, Miss?\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable._ Ha! ha! ha! Not much. But, as Lady ANSWERALL\r\nused to say, when we had a dish of tea and tittle-tattle together in\r\nthe sweet, solid, wicked, bewitching old modish days, \"You know I'm old\r\nTell-truth, and love to call a spade a spade.\"\r\n\r\n_Lady Sparkish._ Oh, I see. As the dear old Dean also said--\r\n\r\n  \"Say, foolish females, bold and blind,\r\n  Say, by what fatal turn of mind,\r\n  Are you on vices most severe\r\n  Wherein yourselves have greatest share?\"\r\n\r\n [_Here arises a general criss-cross clatter of contradictions, and the\r\n gentlemen come in to join the ladies._\r\n\r\n_Mr. Neverout_ (_quoting_)--\r\n\r\n  \"Now voices over voices rise,\r\n  While each to be the loudest vies;\r\n  They contradict, affirm, dispute,\r\n  No single tongue one moment mute;\r\n  All mad to speak and none to hearken,\r\n  They set the very lap-dog barking.\"\r\n\r\nWe were disputing, ladies, as to whether these lines were\r\nSWIFT'S or another's. Can _you_ settle the point?\r\n\r\n_Miss Notable_ (_snappishly_). Oh, ask a policeman--or a New Woman!!!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR OWN TORRIST IN NORTH DEVON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_On Torrs Walks, Ilfracombe._--\"Here they come by twos and twos, In\r\ntwos on Torrs they swarm.\" Quotation adapted. \"Two\" form a Company\r\nLimited on Torrs Walks. The third person present is \"out of it.\" They\r\ntell me these couples are all honeymooners. Perhaps; but _if they are\r\nnot, they ought to be_. That's all.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nMaybe these duologues are only private rehearsals. Practice makes\r\nperfect. I have no special information on this mysterious subject.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n_On the above-mentioned Honeymooners_--\r\n\r\n  \"Marriages are made in heav'n,\"\r\n  When begun in Northern Dev'n.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nA descriptive writer says, \"In the Torrs Walks are to be found the\r\nmost bracing spots in all Ilfracombe.\" From what I have accidentally\r\nobserved, I should correct the above sentence thus:--\"_In the Torrs\r\nWalks are to be found some of the most em-bracing spots in all\r\nIlfracombe_.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n_Rara Avis in Torr-is._--Seldom are birds seen flying about, and\r\nstill fewer hopping about, the Torrs. My jocose friend WILLY\r\nWAGSTAFF says \"Birds only go 'hopping' in Kent.\" Good-bye to W.\r\nW. Somehow, as a rule, the birds do not affect the Torrs. I fancy the\r\ntwopence for entry is a prohibition. Once I saw a lonely bird on the\r\n_penny_ path; but _that_ was a pigeon.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nI have seen a whole flock of rooks cawing querulously--\"quirring\" would\r\nbe a better descriptive participle--on and about the lower part of the\r\nprecipitous, rocky Torrs; but never have I seen them perching on the\r\nhighest point of the Torrs, which is as inaccessible to these birds\r\nat twopence as would be the aforesaid lower portion to the unwinged\r\npedestrian even at a halfpenny; unless pedestrian should arrive at\r\nrookery by accidentally tumbling over from above, in which case it is\r\nmuch to be feared he would probably be \"left till called for.\"\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting sights on the Torrs is the occasional\r\nappearance of a kindly gentleman, carrying a snow-white cockatoo, with\r\na magnificent yellow crest, perfectly tame, and perched on his owner's\r\nwrist, just as the parrot used to perch on the wrist of our old friend\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe parrot, unchained, is a genuine \"Bird of Freedom\"; but he never\r\nmisuses his liberty, nor abuses his privilege of speech, but, from time\r\nto time, he erects or lowers his crest, and expresses his approbation\r\nof things in general, or his disapprobation of anything in particular.\r\nA great companion this POLLY.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n_Recent Solar Discovery._--I picked it up on Torrs Walks. The sun was\r\nsetting magnificently. Near me there stood, observing the effect, a\r\nyoung lady and a very old one. Quoth the former, \"It is a grand sun,\r\nisn't it?\" And the other replied, \"It _is_ a grand-sun, indeed.\" Being\r\nevidently a grandmamma, she ought to know.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNot knowing anything about the political bias of the majority at\r\nIlfracombe, I should say the voters must be chiefly Torr-ies.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOf the steamers plying between Ilfracombe, Swansea, Bristol, and other\r\nneighbouring places, it cannot honestly be said that \"they are no great\r\nshakes.\" If the Master of the Rolls possesses any nautical authority,\r\nit might be advantageously exercised in regard to some of these\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe rule for debarcation and embarcation (on the Swansea, Ilfracombe,\r\n&c., steamers) appears to be, \"Insure the least amount of convenience\r\nto the greatest number possible.\" The inconvenience might be modified\r\n(to put it gently) were the following suggestions acted upon:--\r\n\r\n1st. From Ilfracombe pier there should be four sets of stairs (or more)\r\ninstead of two.\r\n\r\n2nd. Make an upper and a lower deck to pier; the latter for shelter\r\nduring rain and storm. Your hardy sea-dogs seem to be perfectly unaware\r\nof the existence of water descending from the clouds. With them the\r\nrain is \"_in nubibus_.\"\r\n\r\n3rd. There should be two steamers to any one place, one departing\r\njust a quarter of an hour before the other's arrival. Call them \"Box\"\r\nand \"Cox\"--as they both occupy the same harbour. Thus the pier would\r\nnever be inconveniently, or dangerously, crowded by an outgoing and an\r\nincoming crowd at the same moment.\r\n\r\n4th. _Bigger steamers._\r\n\r\n5th. Greatly improved catering, on board, _absolutely necessary_. More\r\nhands to wait at table.\r\n\r\n6th. Other improvements _essential_, but not necessary to mention here\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nOn board an excursion steamer I would retain the musicians, especially\r\nthe cornet; so many persons \"come out for a blow\" that the absence of\r\nthis member of the orchestra would be seriously felt.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n_On board our steamer \"The Brighton,\" to Tenby and back._--I think we\r\nmust have had \"the Something-ean minstrels,\" whose performance was so\r\ngraphically described by DICKENS in _Pickwick_ as enlivening\r\nMrs. LEO HUNTER'S garden party, when \"three of them grunted\r\nand the fourth howled\"; only that, on this occasion, there were about\r\neight or ten of these minstrel boys from Cardiff, who, having left\r\ntheir Welsh harps behind them, sat in the centre of the upper deck,\r\ninflicting their delightful melodies on such of the passengers as were\r\nunable to get out of earshot without either going below, where it was\r\n\"stuffy,\" or into the fore part of the vessel. When these Cambrian\r\nChoristers were not singing they indulged in a little rough and ready\r\nplay with each others caps, a humorous proceeding that seemed to afford\r\nthem almost as much pleasure as did the sound of their own voices, for\r\nthe applause with which they greeted every specimen of their skill in\r\nvocalisation was touchingly unanimous. In this demonstration of mutual\r\napprobation I did not notice any passengers taking part.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNow suppose a party of amateur and comic musicians, a party of\r\namateur choristers, and a Salvationist chorus all on board at the\r\nsame time, and suppose that all these different parties had commenced\r\nsimultaneously, each party giving its special form of entertainment,\r\nwould life be worth living on board that steamer? Surely the captain,\r\nor the company, could put up a notice that only the paid professional\r\nmusicians would be allowed to play and sing on board, and so stop this\r\nExcursionist Babel.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAdvice to passengers by steamboat proposing to land at Lundy\r\nIsland--_Don't_. Lundy is a most interesting island, though it doesn't\r\nlook it. _Further Advice._--Stay on board and read all about Lundy\r\nIsland in your Murray's guide, and, probably, you will then have\r\nacquired far more knowledge of the place than is ever obtained by the\r\nmajority who are permitted and even encouraged to crowd the rowing\r\nboats plying between the steamer and the shore. I, _moi qui parle_,\r\nsaw the men bailing the water out of these boats as they returned from\r\nshore; saw the men and women jammed up together trying to keep at least\r\ntheir ankles dry; and if there had only been some playful 'Arries\r\namong the lot, just a lurch to one side, or the other, would at least\r\nhave shipped enough water to have drenched them up to the knees, and\r\nthen one frightened person might in terror have capsized the boat. I\r\ndo not know who regulates these matters, I only describe what I saw\r\nwith my own eyes and what struck me as being decidedly perilous. Is it\r\nimpossible to build out a pier at Lundy Island? If impossible, cannot\r\nsome regulation as to the number every boat is to carry be enforced?[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Since writing this Your Own Torrist is glad to find his\r\nremarks anticipated by the _Western Daily Press_ (Bristol, September\r\n6), which hints at improvements about to be made in the landing of\r\npassengers both at Lynmouth and at the Mumbles. Let the condition of\r\nthings be bettered also at Lundy and at Ilfracombe.]\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nThe perfumes of Ilfracombe (I think I saw the \"Perfume d'Ilfracombe\"\r\nadvertised as sold in bottles at a local hairdresser's) are various\r\nat various times. Always on the Torrs is the perfume perfect. But\r\nin the lower part of the town they are select and peculiar; as\r\nthus:--Early morning, coming from bathing, and passing by hotels and\r\nboarding-houses, appetising perfume of eggs and bacon everywhere, with\r\nthat of fried fish thrown in. The perfume in the road by the tennis\r\ncourts, where the donkey chairs and cabs stand, is, as may be imagined,\r\nmost delightful when all the flys and donkeys are there at midday,\r\nafternoon, and evening. And in the early morning the faint reminiscence\r\nof yesterday's donkey and cab-stand perfume is, it need hardly be said,\r\nmost exhilarating and delightful to the unbreakfasted passer-by.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew Version.\r\n\r\n(_For the Nursery of the Future._)\r\n\r\n  There was a New Woman, and what do you think?\r\n  She lived upon nothing but paper and ink,\r\n  Though paper and ink formed her favourite diet,\r\n  This noisy New Woman could never keep quiet!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"CURRANT\" RECORDS.--The Cunard steamer _Aleppo_, with a cargo\r\nof 1500 tons of currants on board, has succeeded in raisin' the record\r\nbetween Patras and Liverpool, having accomplished the voyage in 9 days\r\n21-1/2 hours. This vessel has the honour of being the first in with\r\nthe new currant crop, and, as a reward, she will be allowed \"enhanced\r\nfreights.\" 1500 tons of currants fully entitle her, we should say, to\r\n\"take the cake.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCABBY; OR, REMINISCENCES OF THE RANK AND THE ROAD.\r\n\r\n(_By \"Hansom Jack.\"_)\r\n\r\nNo. IV.--OFF DUTY--HARMONY--\"HANSOM UP!\"\r\n\r\n  Cabby off dooty's a clubable man.

Members discovered partaking of light refreshments._\r\n\r\n_First Member_ (_sipping a lemon squash_). Yes, the Royalty is\r\ndecidedly improved in appearance, and the audience, too, is quite up\r\nto the standard of the old _Ixion plus Black-eyed Susan_ days. Quite a\r\npretty house, and quite a distinguished set in the auditorium.\r\n\r\n_Second Mem._ (_lighting a cigarette_). And the play?\r\n\r\n_First Mem._ Distinctly amusing. Both BOURCHIER and his wife\r\nexcellent, and KATE PHILLIPS, as a sorrow-stricken cook,\r\ncapital. Not quite sure whether it would not have been better to have\r\nleft _M. le Directeur_ in France. He was there to the manner born; but\r\nin England--well, to put it plainly, the Home Office in Soho is not in\r\nthe least like the Home Office in Whitehall.\r\n\r\n_Third Mem._ (_finishing a glass of \"improved\" soda water_). But is it\r\nintended to be?\r\n\r\n_Second Mem._ I don't know, but a good many of the audience (presumably\r\nthe gentlemen of the pit and gallery) will adopt the assumption. After\r\nall, to be a member of the Civil Service is something, even in these\r\ndegenerate days. The sketch of official life in Soho will not enhance\r\nthe dignity of the--shall we call it?--profession. But concede that\r\nthe local colouring is appropriate, and _The Chili Widow_ is simply\r\nfirst-rate.\r\n\r\n_Third Mem._ Better than _Bogey_ at the St. James's?\r\n\r\n_Second Mem._ So I have been told. And how about the Garrick?\r\n\r\n_First Mem._ _Alabama_, with WILLARD. Not particularly\r\nexciting. We know how good a man the popular actor can be, but\r\nfor stage purposes he is much more pleasing as a villain. And\r\nTOOLE is back again in his own theatre?\r\n\r\n_Second Mem._ So I have been told. If, as report has it, the visit is\r\nto say farewell, it will be a sad one. Take it all round, there is no\r\nbetter actor in the world than the hero of _Ici on parle Français_, and\r\nthe embodiment of _Pau Claudian_.\r\n\r\n_First Mem._ I quite agree with you. Has any one been to see _India_ at\r\nEarl's Court?\r\n\r\n_Third Mem._ I have. About as fine a spectacle as they make them. The\r\nEmpress Theatre, worthy of its name--the entertainment appropriate to\r\nits surroundings. Quite eclipses Olympia in its most prosperous days.\r\nAnd if you want to see how a few scraps of waste land can be converted\r\ninto a region of gardens, museums, theatres, and palaces, just mount\r\nthe Great Wheel, and look down upon the scene below you.\r\n\r\n [_Enter the_ Waiter, _when the chat about things theatrical is\r\n interrupted by orders for cooling and other drinks.

However, the great gravity of the crisis\r\nmay be understood when, towards the end of the debate on the question,\r\nwe are told that the chairman observed that, \"if this thing was allowed\r\nto go on, perhaps a certain alderman and himself would start a barrow\r\nwith a picture on it, and go about selling fine arts.\" Chorus of\r\naldermen:--\r\n\r\n  Round the town!

The\r\n man of to-day, if he be wise, thinks not of the face and form of the\r\n woman he may care to marry, but asks himself the question, \"Will she\r\n make me a good wife? Can she clean chimneys, cook and mend; is she\r\n capable of discussing intellectually subjects of interest--such as\r\n dentistry, hunting, symbolism, and so forth--with her husband? Can she\r\n grind the organ, play the comb, is she active at crossing-sweeping\r\n and cradle-rocking, quick at smiling away one's smiles and frowning\r\n away one's tears, ready to greet all my friends with the same\r\n amiability she shows to _me_, is she prepared for intelligent\r\n begging-letter-writing, can she scour, skirt-dance, recite, carve,\r\n mangle, and fence?\" Too often he is bound to answer, \"No, she cannot;\r\n so what good is she to me?\" I do not mean to say that all women are\r\n like this. Heaven forbid! But good housewives are few and far between.\r\n There are many girls of the period who are deficient in one or even\r\n more of the accomplishments above-mentioned, so how can she be fitted\r\n for the wife of a middle-class man?\r\n\r\n It is all very well to love, but a vastly different matter to marry\r\n such women as these. Good sound reason and common-sense are better\r\n articles to possess. We cannot have too much of that--indeed, we\r\n often get a great deal more than is good for us, so that in my humble\r\n opinion friendship, common-sense, logic, and grammar are worth more\r\n than all the love any man or woman can give; and it is all very well\r\n to sneer at pessimists, but in my humble opinion they have only\r\n themselves to blame for it, and through all ages it will ever be the\r\n same until there is some alteration.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, your obedient servant,       A SENSIBLE PESSIMIST.\r\n\r\n  _Alma Villa, Sebastopol Road, Balham._\r\n\r\n SIR,--There is an old saying with which we are all\r\n acquainted, and which affirms that \"there are as pretty kettles of\r\n fish in the sea as ever came out of it.\" If you will permit me, I will\r\n quote my own case.\r\n\r\n At the age of seventy-two I married the man of my choice. We had\r\n been married for seven days, when, alas! the truth forced itself\r\n relentlessly upon me that my husband was suffering from depression\r\n of spirits. His nature, which had always been a gay and joyous one,\r\n became apathetic; he seemed indifferent to my society, and before many\r\n weeks were over he bored himself to death.\r\n\r\n I think before eighty is only April sort of sunshine, which only\r\n brings flowers, &c., into bud; it is June, July, and October sunshine\r\n that makes, or the want of it that mars, the harvest. There are many\r\n of my own and the other sex still unmarried, pure, gentle, and loving\r\n old women, who, I think, would gladly enter matrimony. Alas! Love is\r\n laughed about and joked about, but the souls it has ruined are few.\r\n Trusting you will find space for my poor scribble, I am, Sir,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,      HAPPY BROWN BESS.\r\n\r\n  _Earlswood, September 14, 1895._\r\n\r\n[Space forbids further insertions of letters on this\r\nsubject.--ED.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEROR.\r\n\r\n [Mr. H.

Damoetas sweetly sang\r\n  And clear the music of Menalcas rang;\r\n  \"Rest equal happy both,\" in friendly strains\r\n  Palemon said to the Virgilian swains;\r\n  \"Long live and prosper both,\" _Punch_ says to you;\r\n  But O beware the howling harpy crew\r\n  Who'd knock the \"I\" out of our good old Play\r\n  And make it all a matter of mere Pay!\r\n  The rowdies follow where the hucksters lead,\r\n  Football beware of ruffianly greed!\r\n  You're treading far too near that fatal trap;\r\n  Avoid it, or you'll suffer. _Verbum sap!_\r\n  You, cricket ball, to bounce be not a slave.\r\n  Let \"championships\" and \"averages\" have\r\n  Their proper place. Let love of Number One\r\n  Spoil not good sport, good fellowship, good fun.\r\n  In short, whether good luck or bad luck comes\r\n  Just \"play the game,\" like gentlemen and chums!\r\n  So having given his verdict somewhat loth,\r\n  _Punch_ ends with wishing the best luck to both!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE PITY O' IT!\"\r\n\r\n\"WELL, SIMPSON, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE HOT WEATHER?\"\r\n\r\n\"CAN'T STAND IT, SIR!

From an advertisement which has\r\nappeared in an evening contemporary I gather that \"the multitude,\r\nanxious to spend an elegant and fashionable sojourn in the country,\r\nhas rendered itself this year at Ostend. It is a long time since such\r\nan opulent clientèle has been united in a seaside resort. At the fall\r\nof day the vast terraces of the fashionable restaurants, situated\r\nalong the sea-bank, present a fairy aspect. There is quite a confusion\r\nof dazzling costumes upon which sparkle thousand gems, and all this\r\nhandsome cosmopolitan society passes through the saloons of the Kursaal\r\nClub, in which one hears spoken all known languages as at Babel and\r\nMonte Carlo, and of which the attractions are identical to those of\r\nthe latter place.\" This is the first time I have heard of a similarity\r\nto Babel being mentioned as an attraction. But no doubt an opulent\r\nclientèle has peculiar tastes of its own, especially when its dazzling\r\ncostumes sparkle with thousand gems.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a small Belgian town (naturally not Ostend) I once saw the following\r\nnotice hung over the door of a washerwoman's establishment:--\r\n\r\n  Anglish linge tooke here from 1 sou\r\n  Shert, cols, soaks, sleep-shert, pokets.\r\n              I eet my hatt.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence puzzled me for a long time. Finally I came to the\r\nconclusion that it was not intended so much to be a statement of actual\r\nfact as an enticement to English people, who would of course take all\r\ntheir washing to a lady commanding so gay and accurate a knowledge of\r\nan English catch-phrase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy third example of English as she is spoke is from a notice issued by\r\nan out-of-the-way hotel in Italy, which had changed its management:--\r\n\r\n The nobles and noblesses traveller are beg to tell that the direction\r\n of this splendid hotel have bettered himself. And the strangers will\r\n also find high comforting luxuries, hot cold water coffee bath and\r\n all things of perfect establishment and at prices fixed. Table d'hôte\r\n best of Italy France everywere. Onclean linens is quick wash and\r\n every journals is buy for readers. Beds hard or soaft at the taste of\r\n traveller. Soaps everywere plenty. Very cheaper than other hotel. No\r\n mosquits no parrot no rat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd this (though the connection is not, at first sight, very clear)\r\nbrings me to the Vicar of Sparkbrook. Only the other day he was\r\npresiding at a meeting held in aid of the funds of the Christ Church\r\n(Sparkbrook) Day Schools. Alluding to the importance of maintaining\r\nChurch Schools, he said (I quote from a Birmingham paper) that \"though\r\nhe did not want to touch on politics, he must express his thankfulness\r\nthat they had a Government in power which was favourable to Church\r\nSchools, and which was pledged to construct, and not to destruct.\"\r\nThe Vicar's feeling for emphasis is admirable. The sentence gains\r\nimmeasurably in force by the perversion \"destruct.\" And we ought to be\r\nspecially grateful to him for refraining from the other alternative. If\r\nhe had said, as it was open for him to say, \"which was pledged not to\r\ndestroy, but to constroy,\" the effect would have been terrible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was staying at a London hotel a short time ago and had occasion to\r\nwrite a letter in the public reading-room. Sitting down to one of\r\nthe writing-tables and opening the portfolio I found that a previous\r\noccupant had left in it an unfinished letter which, with all necessary\r\napologies, I here transcribe in full:\r\n\r\n MY DARLING HARRY,--I am fading like a flower deprived of\r\n its natural nourishment without you, my darling, my own little\r\n sniperpop----\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow what, in the name of Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON, can a \"sniperpop\"\r\nbe?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  How shall I name you? Darling, dove,\r\n    Partridge (or any other bird)\r\n  Are not the names I seek, my love;\r\n    I want just one caressing word,\r\n  One word which, whether old or new,\r\n    Shall prove my depth of love for you.\r\n\r\n  Without it all my power is gone,\r\n    Without my own I feebly fade:\r\n  In vain I turn the lexicon,\r\n    The word I want is not yet made.\r\n  Must I entreat, to ease my pain,\r\n    Divine Philology in vain?\r\n\r\n  Ah, little nowadays it boots\r\n    To imitate primeval man;\r\n  Our Aryan ancestors had roots\r\n    With which to formulate their plan.\r\n  They used them all--they had their fun--\r\n    And left us not a single one.\r\n\r\n  Yet, oh my HARRY, something tells\r\n    Your own she may, she must succeed--\r\n  What's this? Yes, yes, ring out the bells;\r\n    From grief's dark thunder-cloud I'm freed.\r\n  No longer shall I droop or drop--\r\n    _Eureka_, \"little Sniperpop.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _Newcastle Daily Journal_ I read that \"for some time a\r\ncertain amount of feeling has existed at Crawcrook on the question\r\nof horse-shoeing.\" This culminated in a challenge by JOSEPH\r\nDELAFIELD to GEORGE LATHAN, both these gentlemen being\r\nmaster blacksmiths. A match for £5 was soon made, \"each man to shoe the\r\nfoot of a draught-horse in the quickest and best style.\" Here there\r\nmust be some mistake, since if each man did the job in the quickest\r\nand best style, the result obviously must be a dead heat. However \"the\r\nmatch commenced on Saturday morning at the shop of LATHAN.\r\nAfter LATHAN finished his work, which occupied forty-three\r\nminutes, the horse was driven to the shop of DELAFIELD, who\r\noccupied forty-one minutes in the operation. Large crowds were on the\r\nspot to witness the match. Mr. JOHN CHAPMAN of Whittonstall,\r\nthe judge, gave his decision in favour of LATHAN.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is something very sporting and attractive about all this. One man\r\nwins the match, the other can console himself by the reflection that he\r\nhad two minutes the better of it on time. There seems to have been no\r\ngrumbling, and (although the fact is not stated) I have no doubt the\r\nparties met at an enthusiastic dinner in the evening and toasted the\r\ngood old English sport of horse-shoeing. The authorities at Oxford and\r\nCambridge might do worse than institute a horse-shoeing competition\r\nbetween teams of undergraduates, who would of course strike blue nails\r\ninto blue shoes with blue hammers. A \"blazer\" would be particularly\r\nappropriate to such a contest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR FASHION LETTER.\r\n\r\n(_Extracted from the \"Poppleton Academy College Gazette.\"_)\r\n\r\nDEAR THOMAS,--As September advances, the wave of fashion is\r\nonce more filling our best academies, so that a few hints as to the\r\nlatest _modes_ may well be of service to you. Have you seen the new\r\ndouble pocket? It is quite _chic_. It is constructed simply enough\r\nby making a large hole in the side-pockets of your coat, thereby\r\nyou will find there is an useful space beneath the lining, in which\r\nsuch necessary trifles as a lump of toffee or a Jew's-harp can be\r\ncomfortably disposed of. Buttons will not be much worn, especially as\r\nthe term advances. It is rumoured that FORKER _major_ has\r\ngone into tails; and if this be true, probably others will follow his\r\nexample before long.\r\n\r\nMy old friend RICHARD--a well-known connoisseur in such\r\nmatters--strongly recommends the new confectioner's shop near the\r\nschool. The Turkish Delight sold there is quite admirable, I am told,\r\nand a single bar of the stick-jaw, if used carefully, will last for\r\nan entire day. Talking of shopping, I have been to the bookseller's\r\nlately. What a misfortune it is that the publishers do not issue\r\nMessrs. BOHN'S Classical Library at a lower price! The present\r\none is almost prohibitive to those of us who wish to avoid a certain\r\namount of drudgery, and to please our excellent pedagogues at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHave you heard rumours of a boom in marbles? Hitherto one has\r\nassociated the game with the lower classes, but I understand that two\r\nUpper-Fifth gentlemen were seen to play it last week. If so, it will\r\nsoon be widely popular. By the way, the report that JOHNSON\r\n_minor_ is seriously ill is absurd. The truth of the matter is, that\r\nthis dashing sportsman had undertaken to eat thirty cracknels in ten\r\nminutes, without drink of any kind. The result--he lost by half a\r\ncracknel--was to cause him some temporary inconvenience, but he is now\r\ncompletely restored to health.\r\n\r\nHere are two recipes, which, I think, you will like:--\r\n\r\n1. _Bacon à la Dormitory._ Procure a piece of bacon, and cut it into\r\nstrips. Impale these, one at a time, on a penholder, and frizzle them\r\nslowly over the dormitory gas. (Care should be taken that the tutor\r\nis out, as the fragrance caused by the bacon is considerable.) When\r\nsufficiently done, chop up with penknives, and serve hot. Condensed\r\nmilk should be drunk with this dish.\r\n\r\n2. _Marrons à la Poppleton._ Place some chestnuts between the bars of\r\nthe fireplace. Do not break the skins. Presently the roasted nuts will\r\nfly into the room with a loud report, and much amusement will be caused\r\nif they happen to hit anybody on the face. They may then be picked up\r\nand eaten. Sherbet is an appropriate drink with which to accompany them.\r\n\r\n  Yours ever,\r\n  WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Punch or the London Charivari, Vol.\r\n109, September 21, 1895, by Various",

Of its very\r\nnature, satiric drama comes later than Epic and Lyric poetry, Tragedy or\r\nHistory; Aristophanes follows Homer and Simonides, Sophocles and\r\nThucydides. Of its essence, it is free from many of the conventions and\r\nrestraining influences of earlier forms of literature, and enjoys much of\r\nthe liberty of choice of subject and licence of method that marks\r\npresent-day conditions of literary production both on and off the stage.\r\nIts very existence presupposes a fuller and bolder intellectual life, a\r\nmore advanced and complex city civilization, a keener taste and livelier\r\nfaculty of comprehension in the people who appreciate it, than could\r\nanywhere be found at an earlier epoch. Speaking broadly and generally,\r\nthe Aristophanic drama has more in common with modern ways of looking at\r\nthings, more in common with the conditions of the modern stage,\r\nespecially in certain directions--burlesque, extravaganza, musical farce,\r\nand even 'pantomime,' than with the earlier and graver products of the\r\nGreek mind.\r\n\r\nThe eleven plays, all that have come down to us out of a total of over\r\nforty staged by our author in the course of his long career, deal with\r\nthe events of the day, the incidents and personages of contemporary\r\nAthenian city life, playing freely over the surface of things familiar to\r\nthe audience and naturally provoking their interest and rousing their\r\nprejudices, dealing with contemporary local gossip, contemporary art and\r\nliterature, and above all contemporary politics, domestic and foreign.\r\nAll this _farrago_ of miscellaneous subjects is treated in a frank,\r\nuncompromising spirit of criticism and satire, a spirit of broad fun,\r\nside-splitting laughter and reckless high spirits. Whatever lends itself\r\nto ridicule is instantly seized upon; odd, eccentric and degraded\r\npersonalities are caricatured, social foibles and vices pilloried,\r\npomposity and sententiousness in the verses of the poets, particularly\r\nthe tragedians, and most particularly in Euripides--the pet aversion and\r\nconstant butt of Aristophanes' satire--are parodied. All is fish that\r\ncomes to the Comic dramatists net, anything that will raise a laugh is\r\nfair game.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to compare the Aristophanic Comedy to any one form of\r\nmodern literature, dramatic or other. It perhaps most resembles what we\r\nnow call burlesque; but it had also very much in it of broad farce and\r\ncomic opera, and something also (in the hits at the fashions and follies\r\nof the day with which it abounded) of the modern pantomime. But it was\r\nsomething more, and more important to the Athenian public than any or all\r\nof these could have been. Almost always more or less political, and\r\nsometimes intensely personal, and always with some purpose more or less\r\nimportant underlying its wildest vagaries and coarsest buffooneries, it\r\nsupplied the place of the political journal, the literary review, the\r\npopular caricature and the party pamphlet, of our own times. It combined\r\nthe attractions and influence of all these; for its grotesque masks and\r\nelaborate 'spectacle' addressed the eye as strongly as the author's\r\nkeenest witticisms did the ear of his audience.\"[1]\r\n\r\nRollicking, reckless, uproarious fun is the key-note; though a more\r\nserious intention is always latent underneath. Aristophanes was a\r\nstrong--sometimes an unscrupulous--partisan; he was an uncompromising\r\nConservative of the old school, an ardent admirer of the vanishing\r\naristocratic régime, an anti-Imperialist--'Imperialism' was a\r\n_democratic_ craze at Athens--and never lost an opportunity of throwing\r\nscorn on Cleon the demagogue, his political _bête noïre_ and personal\r\nenemy, Cleon's henchmen of the popular faction, and the War party\r\ngenerally. Gravity, solemnity, seriousness, are conspicuous by their\r\nabsence; even that 'restraint' which is the salient characteristic of\r\nGreek expression in literature no less than in Art, is largely relaxed in\r\nthe rough-and-tumble, informal, miscellaneous _modern_ phantasmagoria of\r\nthese diverting extravaganzas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we must not be misled by the word 'Comedy' to bring\r\nAristophanes' work into comparison with what we call Comedy now. This is\r\nquite another thing--confined to a representation of incidents of\r\nprivate, generally polite life, and made up of the intrigues and\r\nentanglements of social and domestic situations. Such a Comedy the Greeks\r\ndid produce, but at a date fifty or sixty years subsequent to\r\nAristophanes' day, and recognized by themselves as belonging to an\r\nentirely different genre. Hence the distinction drawn between 'The Old\r\nComedy,' of which Cratinus and his younger contemporaries, Eupolis and\r\nAristophanes, were the leading representatives, and which was at\r\nhigh-water mark just before and during the course of the great struggle\r\nof the Peloponnesian War, and 'The New Comedy,' a comedy of manners, the\r\ntwo chief exponents of which were Philemon and Menander, writing after\r\nAthens had fallen under the Macedonian yoke, and politics were excluded\r\naltogether from the stage. Menander's plays in turn were the originals of\r\nthose produced by Plautus and Terence at Rome, whose existing Comedies\r\nafford some faint idea of what the lost masterpieces of their Greek\r\npredecessor must have been. Unlike the 'Old,' the 'New Comedy' had no\r\nChorus and no 'Parabasis.'\r\n\r\nThis remarkable and distinctive feature, by-the-bye, of the Old Comedy,\r\nthe 'Parabasis' to wit, calls for a word of explanation. It was a direct\r\naddress on the Author's part to the audience, delivered in verse of a\r\nspecial metre, generally towards the close of the representation, by the\r\nleader of the Chorus, but expressing the personal opinions and\r\npredilections of the poet, and embodying any remarks upon current topics\r\nand any urgent piece of advice which he was particularly anxious to\r\ninsist on. Often it was made the vehicle for special appeal to the\r\nsympathetic consideration of the spectators for the play and its merits.\r\nThese 'parabases,' so characteristic of the Aristophanic comedy, are\r\nconceived in the brightest and wittiest vein, and abound in topical\r\nallusions and personal hits that must have constituted them perhaps the\r\nmost telling part of the whole performance.\r\n\r\nAristophanes deals with all questions; for him the domain of the Comic\r\nPoet has no limits, his mission is as wide as human nature. It is to\r\nAthens he addresses himself, to the city as a whole; his criticism\r\nembraces morals no less than politics, poetry no less than philosophy; he\r\ndoes not hesitate to assail the rites and dogmas of Paganism; whatever\r\naffords subject for laughter or vituperation lies within his province;\r\nthere he is in his element, scourge in hand, his heart ablaze with\r\nindignation, pitiless, and utterly careless of all social distinctions.\r\n\r\nIn Politics Aristophanes belongs to the party of the Aristocracy. He\r\ncould not do otherwise, seeing that the democratic principle was then\r\ntriumphant; Comedy is never laudatory, it lives upon criticism, it must\r\nbite to the quick to win a hearing; its strength, its vital force is\r\ncontradiction. Thus the abuses of democracy and demagogy were the most\r\nfavourable element possible for the development of Aristophanes' genius,\r\njust because his merciless satire finds more abundant subject-matter\r\nthere than under any other form of civil constitution. Then are we\r\nactually to believe that the necessity of his profession as a comic poet\r\nalone drove him into the faction of the malcontents? This would surely be\r\nto wilfully mistake the dignity of character and consistency of\r\nconviction which are to be found underlying all his productions.\r\nThroughout his long career as a dramatist his predilections always remain\r\nthe same, as likewise his antipathies, and in many respects the party he\r\nchampions so ardently had claims to be regarded as representing the best\r\ninterests of the state.  It is but just therefore to proclaim\r\nAristophanes as having deserved well of his country, and to admit the\r\ngenuine courage he displayed in attacking before the people the people's\r\nown favourites, assailing in word those who held the sword. To mock at\r\nthe folly of a nation that lets itself be cajoled by vain and empty\r\nflatteries, to preach peace to fellow-citizens enamoured of war, was to\r\nfulfil a dangerous rôle, that would never have appealed, we may feel\r\nsure, to a mere vulgar ambition.\r\n\r\nMoreover his genius, pre-eminently Greek as it is, has an instinctive\r\nhorror of all excesses, and hits out at them wherever he marks their\r\nexistence, whether amongst the great or the humble of the earth.\r\nSupposing the Aristocracy, having won the victory the Poet desired, had\r\nfallen in turn into oppression and misgovernment, doubtless Aristophanes\r\nwould have lashed its members with his most biting sarcasms. It is just\r\nbecause Liberty is dear to his heart that he hates government by\r\nDemagogues; he would fain free the city from the despotism of a clique of\r\nwretched intriguers that oppressed her. But at the same time the\r\nAristocracy favoured by our Author was not such as comes by birth and\r\nprivilege, but such as is won and maintained by merit and high service to\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nIn matters of morality his satires have the same high aims. How should a\r\ncorrupted population recover purity, if not by returning to the old\r\nunsullied sources from which earlier generations had drawn their\r\ninspiration? Accordingly we find Aristophanes constantly bringing on the\r\nstage the \"men of Marathon,\" the vigorous generation to which Athens owed\r\nher freedom and her greatness. It is no mere childish commonplace with\r\nour poet, this laudation of a past age; the facts of History prove he was\r\nin the right, all the novelties he condemns were as a matter of fact so\r\nmany causes that brought about Athenian decadence. Directly the citizen\r\nreceives payment for attending the Assembly, he is no longer a perfectly\r\nfree agent in the disposal of his vote; besides, the practice is\r\nequivalent to setting a premium on idleness, and so ruining all proper\r\nactivity; a populace maintained by the state loses all energy, falls into\r\na lethargy and dies. The life of the forum is a formidable solvent of\r\nvirtue and vigour; by dint of speechifying, men forget how to act.\r\nAnother thing was the introduction of 'the new education,' imported by\r\n'the Sophists,' which substituted for serious studies, definitely limited\r\nand systematically pursued, a crowd of vague and subtle speculations; it\r\nwas a mental gymnastic that gave suppleness to the wits, it is true, but\r\nonly by corrupting and deteriorating the moral sense, a system that in\r\nthe long run was merely destructive. Such, then, was the threefold poison\r\nthat was destroying Athenian morality--the triobolus, the noisy\r\nassemblies in the Agora, the doctrines of the Sophists; the antidote was\r\nthe recollection of former virtue and past prosperity, which the Poet\r\nsystematically revives in contrast with the turpitudes and trivialities\r\nof the present day. There is no turning back the course of history; but\r\nif Aristophanes' efforts have remained abortive, they are not therefore\r\ninglorious. Is the moralist to despair and throw away his pen, because in\r\nso many cases his voice finds no echo?\r\n\r\nAgain we find Aristophanes' literary views embodying the same good sense\r\nwhich led him to see the truth in politics and morals. Here likewise it\r\nis not the individual he attacks; his criticism is general. His adversary\r\nis not the individual Euripides, but under his name depraved taste and\r\nthe abandonment of that noble simplicity which had produced the\r\nmasterpieces of the age of Pericles. Euripides was no ordinary writer,\r\nthat is beyond question; but the very excellence of his qualities made\r\nhis influence only the more dangerous.\r\n\r\nLiterary reform is closely connected with moral regeneration, the\r\ndecadence of the one being both cause and effect of the deterioration of\r\nthe other. The author who should succeed in purifying the public taste\r\nwould come near restoring to repute healthy and honest views of life.\r\nAristophanes essayed the task both by criticism and example--by\r\ncriticism, directing the shafts of his ridicule at over-emphasis and\r\nover-subtlety, by example, writing himself in inimitable perfection the\r\nbeautiful Attic dialect, which was being enervated and effeminated and\r\nspoiled in the hands of his opponents.\r\n\r\nEven the Gods were not spared by the Aristophanic wit and badinage; in\r\n'Plutus,' in 'The Birds,' in 'The Frogs,' we see them very roughly\r\nhandled. To wonder at these profane drolleries, however, is to fail\r\naltogether to grasp the privileges of ancient comedy and the very nature\r\nof Athenian society. The Comic Poets exercised unlimited rights of making\r\nfun; we do not read in history of a single one of the class having ever\r\nbeen called to the bar of justice to answer for the audacity of his\r\ndramatic efforts. The same liberty extended to religious matters; the\r\nAthenian people, keen, delicately organized, quick to see a joke and\r\nloving laughter for its own sake, even when the point told against\r\nthemselves, this people of mockers felt convinced the Gods appreciated\r\nraillery just as well as men did. Moreover, the Greeks do not appear to\r\nhave had any very strong attachment to Paganism as a matter of dogmatic\r\nbelief. To say nothing of the enlightened classes, who saw in this vast\r\nhierarchy of divinities only an ingenious allegory, the populace even was\r\nmainly concerned with the processions and songs and dances, the banquets\r\nand spectacular shows and all the external pomp and splendour of a cult\r\nthe magnificence and varied rites of which amused its curiosity. But\r\nserious faith, ardent devotion, dogmatic discussion, is there a trace of\r\nthese things? A sensual and poetic type of religion, Paganism was\r\naccepted at Athens only by the imagination, not by the reason; its\r\nceremonies were duly performed, without any real piety touching the\r\nheart. Thus the audience felt no call to champion the cause of their\r\ndeities when held up to ribaldry on the open stage; they left them to\r\ndefend themselves--if they could.\r\n\r\nThus Aristophanes, we see, covered the whole field of thought; he\r\nscourged whatever was vicious or ridiculous, whether before the altars of\r\nthe Gods, in the schools of the Sophists, or on the Orators' platform.\r\nBut the wider the duty he undertook, the harder it became to fulfil this\r\nduty adequately. How satisfy a public made up of so many and such diverse\r\nelements, so sharply contrasted by birth, fortune, education, opinion,\r\ninterest? How hold sway over a body of spectators, who were at the same\r\ntime judges? To succeed in the task he was bound to be master of all\r\nstyles of diction--at one and the same time a dainty poet and a diverting\r\nbuffoon. It is just this universality of genius, this combination of the\r\nmost eminent and various qualities, that has won Aristophanes a place\r\napart among satirists; and if it be true to say that well-written works\r\nnever die, the style alone of his Comedies would have assured their\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\nNo writer, indeed, has been more pre-eminent in that simple, clear,\r\nprecise, elegant diction that is the peculiar glory of Attic literature,\r\nthe brilliant yet concise quality of which the authors of no other Greek\r\ncity were quite able to attain. He shows, each in its due turn, vigour\r\nand suppleness of language, he exercises a sure and spontaneous choice of\r\ncorrect terms, the proper combination of harmonious phrases, he goes\r\nstraight to his object, he aims well and hits hard, even when he seems to\r\nbe merely grazing the surface. Under his apparent negligence lies\r\nconcealed the high perfection of accomplished art. This applies to the\r\ndialogues. In the choruses, Aristophanes speaks the tongue of Pindar and\r\nSophocles; he follows the footsteps of those two mighty masters of the\r\nchoric hymn into the highest regions of poetry; his lyric style is bold,\r\nimpetuous, abounding in verve and brilliance, yet without the high-flown\r\ninspiration ever involving a lapse from good taste.\r\n\r\nOne of the forms in which he is fondest of clothing his conceptions is\r\nallegory; it may truly lie said that the stage of Aristophanes is a\r\nseries of caricatures where every idea has taken on a corporeal\r\npresentment and is reproduced under human lineaments. To personify the\r\nabstract notion, to dress it up in the shape of an animated being for its\r\nbetter comprehension by the public, is in fact a proceeding altogether in\r\nharmony with the customs and conventions of Ancient Comedy. The Comic\r\nPoet never spares us a single detail of everyday life, no matter how\r\ncommonplace or degrading; he pushes the materialistic delineation of the\r\npassions and vices to the extreme limit of obscene gesture and the most\r\ncynical shamelessness of word and act.\r\n\r\nThis scorn of propriety, this unchecked licence of speech, has often been\r\nmade a subject of reproach against Aristophanes, and it appears to the\r\nbest modern critics that the poet would have been not a whit less\r\ndiverting or effective had he respected the dictates of common decency.\r\nBut it is only fair, surely, before finally condemning our Author, to\r\nconsider whether the times in which he lived, the origin itself of the\r\nGreek Comedy, and the constitution of the audience, do not entitle him at\r\nany rate to claim the benefit of extenuating circumstances. We must not\r\nforget that Comedy owes its birth to those festivals at which Priapus was\r\nadored side by side with Bacchus, and that 'Phallophoria' (carrying the\r\nsymbols of generation in procession) still existed as a religious rite at\r\nthe date when Aristophanes was composing his plays. Nor must we forget\r\nthat theatrical performances were at Athens forbidden pleasures to women\r\nand children. Above all we should take full account of the code of social\r\ncustom and morality then prevailing. The Ancients never understood\r\nmodesty quite in the same way as our refined modern civilization does;\r\nthey spoke of everything without the smallest reticence, and expressions\r\nwhich would revolt the least squeamish amongst ourselves did not surprise\r\nor shock the most fastidious. We ought not, therefore, to blame too\r\nseverely the Comic Poet, who after all was only following in this respect\r\nthe habits of his age; and if his pictures are often repulsively bestial,\r\nlet us lay most blame to the account of a state of society which deserved\r\nto be painted in such odiously black colours. Doubtless Aristophanes\r\nmight have given less Prominence to these cynical representations,\r\ninstead of revelling in them, as he really seems to have done; men of\r\ntaste and refinement, and there must have been such even among his\r\naudience, would have thought all the better of him! But it was the\r\npopulace filled the bulk of the benches, and the populace loved coarse\r\nlaughter and filthy words. The Poet supplied what the majority demanded;\r\nhe was not the man to sacrifice one of the easiest and surest means of\r\nwinning applause and popularity.\r\n\r\nAristophanes enjoyed an ample share of glory in his lifetime, and\r\nposterity has ratified the verdict given by his contemporaries. The\r\nepitaph is well-known which Plato composed for him, after his death: \"The\r\nGraces, seeking an imperishable sanctuary, found the soul of\r\nAristophanes.\" Such eulogy may appear excessive to one who re-peruses\r\nafter the lapse of twenty centuries these pictures of a vanished world.\r\nBut if, despite the profound differences of custom, taste and opinion\r\nwhich separate our own age from that of the Greeks, despite the obscurity\r\nof a host of passages whose especial point lay in their reference to some\r\ntopic of the moment, and which inevitably leave us cold at the present\r\nday--if, despite all this, we still feel ourselves carried away, charmed,\r\ndiverted, dominated by this dazzling _verve_, these copious outpourings\r\nof imagination, wit and poesy, let us try to realize in thought what must\r\nhave been the unbounded pleasure of an Athenian audience listening to one\r\nof our Author's satires. Then every detail was realized, every nuance of\r\ncriticism appreciated; every allusion told, and the model was often\r\nactually sitting in the semicircle of the auditorium facing the copy at\r\nthat time being presented on the stage. \"What a passion of excitement!\r\nWhat transports of enthusiasm and angry protest! What bursts of\r\nuncontrollable merriment! What thunders of applause! How the Comic Poet\r\nmust have felt himself a King, indeed, in presence of these popular\r\nstorms which, like the god of the sea, he could arouse and allay at his\r\ngood will and pleasure!\"[2]\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the coarseness of language so often pointed to\r\nas a blot in Aristophanes. \"The great comedian has been censured and\r\napologized for on this ground, over and over again. His personal\r\nexculpation must always rest upon the fact, that the wildest licence in\r\nwhich he indulged was not only recognized as permissible, but actually\r\nenjoined as part of the ceremonial at these festivals of Bacchus; that it\r\nwas not only in accordance with public taste, but was consecrated as a\r\npart of the national religion.... But the coarseness of Aristophanes is\r\nnot corrupting. There is nothing immoral in his plots, nothing really\r\ndangerous in his broadest humour. Compared with some of our old English\r\ndramatists, he is morality itself. And when we remember the plots of some\r\nFrench and English plays which now attract fashionable audiences, and the\r\ncharacter of some modern French and English novels not unfrequently found\r\n(at any rate in England) upon drawing-room tables, the least that can be\r\nsaid is, that we had better not cast stones at Aristophanes.\"[3]\r\nMoreover, it should be borne in mind that Athenian custom did not\r\nsanction the presence of women--at least women of reputable character--at\r\nthese performances.\r\n\r\nThe particular plays, though none are free from it, which most abound in\r\nthis ribald fun--for fun it always is, never mere pruriency for its own\r\nsake, Aristophanes has a deal of the old 'esprit gaulois' about him--are\r\nthe 'Peace' and, as might be expected from its theme, lending itself so\r\nreadily to suggestive allusions and situations, above all the\r\n'Lysistrata.' The 'Thesmophoriazusae' and 'Ecclesiazusae' also take ample\r\ntoll in this sort of the 'risqué' situations incidental to their plots,\r\nthe dressing up of men as women in the former, and of women as men in the\r\nlatter. Needless to say, no faithful translator will emasculate his\r\nauthor by expurgation, and the reader will here find Aristophanes'\r\nComedies as Aristophanes wrote them, not as Mrs. Grundy might wish him to\r\nhave written them.\r\n\r\nThese performances took place at the Festivals of Dionysus (Bacchus),\r\neither the Great Dionysia or the minor celebration of the Lenaea, and\r\nwere in a sense religious ceremonials--at any rate under distinct\r\nreligious sanction. The representations were held in the Great Theatre of\r\nDionysus, under the slope of the Acropolis, extensive remains of which\r\nstill exist; several plays were brought out at each festival in\r\ncompetition, and prizes, first and second, were awarded to the most\r\nsuccessful productions--rewards which were the object of the most intense\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nNext to nothing is known of the private life of Aristophanes, and that\r\nlittle, beyond the two or three main facts given below, is highly\r\ndubious, not to say apocryphal. He was born about 444 B.C., probably at\r\nAthens. His father held property in Aegina, and the family may very\r\nlikely have come originally from that island. At any rate, this much is\r\ncertain, that the author's arch-enemy Cleon made more than one judicial\r\nattempt to prove him of alien birth and therefore not properly entitled\r\nto the rights of Athenian citizenship; but in this he entirely failed.\r\nThe great Comedian had three sons, but of these and their career history\r\nsays nothing whatever. Such incidents and anecdotes of our author's\r\nliterary life as have come down to us are all connected with one or other\r\nof the several plays, and will be found alluded to in the special\r\nIntroductions prefixed to these. He died about 380 B.C.--the best and\r\ncentral years of his life and work thus coinciding with the great\r\nnational period of stress and struggle, the Peloponnesian War, 431-404\r\nB.C. He continued to produce plays for the Athenian stage for the long\r\nperiod of thirty-seven years; though only eleven Comedies, out of a\r\nreputed total of forty, have survived.\r\n\r\nA word or two as to existing translations of Aristophanes. These, the\r\nEnglish ones at any rate, leave much to be desired; indeed it is not too\r\nmuch to say that there is no version of our Author in the language which\r\ngives the general reader anything like an adequate notion of these Plays.\r\nWe speak of prose renderings. Aristophanes has been far more fortunate in\r\nhis verse translators--Mitchell, who published four Comedies in this form\r\nin 1822, old-fashioned, but still helpful, Hookham Frere, five plays\r\n(1871), both scholarly and spirited, and last but not least, Mr. Bickley\r\nRogers, whose excellent versions have appeared at intervals since 1867.\r\nBut from their very nature these cannot afford anything like an exact\r\nidea of the 'ipsissima verba' of the Comedies, while all slur over or\r\nomit altogether passages in any way 'risqué.' There remains only our old\r\nfriend 'Bohn' (\"The Comedies of Aristophanes; a literal Translation by W.\r\nJ. Hickie\"), and what stuff 'Bohn' is! By very dint of downright\r\nliteralness--though not, by-the-bye, always downright accuracy--any true\r\nnotion of the Author's meaning is quite obscured. The letter kills the\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe French prose versions are very good. That by C. Poyard (in the series\r\nof \"Chefs-d'oeuvre des Littératures Anciennes\") combines scholarly\r\nprecision with an easy, racy, vernacular style in a way that seems\r\nimpossible to any but a French scholar.\r\n\r\nThe order here adopted for the successive plays differs slightly from\r\nthat observed in most editions; but as these latter do not agree amongst\r\nthemselves, this small assumption of licence appears not unwarrantable.\r\nChronologically 'The Acharnians' (426 B.C.) should come first; but it\r\nseems more convenient to group it with the two other \"Comedies of the\r\nWar,\" the whole trilogy dealing with the hardships involved by the\r\nstruggle with the Lacedaemonians and the longings of the Athenian people\r\nfor the blessings of peace. This leaves 'The Knights' to open the whole\r\nseries--the most important politically of all Aristophanes' productions,\r\nembodying as it does his trenchant attack on the great demagogue Cleon\r\nand striking the keynote of the author's general attitude as advocate of\r\nold-fashioned conservatism against the new democracy, its reckless\r\n'Imperialism' and the unscrupulous and self-seeking policy, so the\r\naristocratic party deemed it, of its accredited leaders.\r\n\r\nOrder, as thus rearranged, approximate date, and _motif_ (in brief) of\r\neach of the eleven Comedies are given below:\r\n\r\n    'The Knights': 424 B.C.--eighth year of the War. Attacks Cleon, the\r\n    Progressives, and the War policy generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Comedies of the War:--\r\n\r\n    'The Acharnians': 426 B.C.--sixth year of the War. Insists on the\r\n    miseries consequent on the War, especially affecting the rural\r\n    population, as represented by the Acharnian Dicaeopolis and his\r\n    fellow demesmen. Incidentally makes fun of the tragedian Euripides.\r\n\r\n    'Peace': 422 B.C.--tenth year of the War. Further insists on the same\r\n    theme, and enlarges on the blessings of Peace. The hero Trygaeus\r\n    flies to Olympus, mounted on a beetle, to bring back the goddess\r\n    Peace to earth.\r\n\r\n    'Lysistrata': 411 B.C.--twenty-first year of the War. A burlesque\r\n    conspiracy entered into by the confederated women of Hellas, led by\r\n    Lysistrata the Athenian, to compel the men to conclude peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'The Clouds': 423 B.C.--satirizes Socrates, the 'Sophists,' and the\r\n    'New Education.'\r\n\r\n    'The Wasps': 422 B.C. Makes fun of the Athenian passion for\r\n    litigation, and the unsatisfactory organization of the Courts.\r\n    Contains the incident of the mock trial of the thievish house-dog.\r\n\r\n    'The Birds': 414 B.C. Euelpides and Pisthetaerus, disgusted with the\r\n    state of things at Athens, build a new and improved city,\r\n    Cloud-cuckoo-town, in the kingdom of the birds. Some see an allusion\r\n    to the Sicilian expedition, and Alcibiades' Utopian schemes.\r\n\r\n    'The Frogs': 405 B.C. A satire on Euripides and the 'New Tragedy.'\r\n    Dionysus, patron of the Drama, dissatisfied with the contemporary\r\n    condition of the Art, goes down to Hades to bring back to earth a\r\n    poet of the older and worthier school.\r\n\r\n    'The Thesmophoriazusae': 412 B.C. Another literary satire; Euripides,\r\n    summoned as a notorious defamer of women to defend himself before the\r\n    dames of Athens assembled in solemn conclave at the Thesmophoria, or\r\n    festival of Demeter and Persephone, induces his father-in-law,\r\n    Mnesilochus, to dress up in women's clothes, penetrate thus disguised\r\n    into the assemblage, and plead the poet's cause, but with scant\r\n    success.\r\n\r\n    'The Ecclesiazusae': 392 B.C. Pokes fun at the ideal Utopias, such as\r\n    Plato's 'Republic,' based on sweeping social and economic changes,\r\n    greatly in vogue with the Sophists of the day. The women of the city\r\n    disguise themselves as men, slip into the Public Assembly and secure\r\n    a majority of votes. They then pass a series of decrees providing for\r\n    community of goods and community of women, which produce,\r\n    particularly the latter, a number of embarrassing and diverting\r\n    consequences.\r\n\r\n    'Plutus': 408 and 388 B.C. A whimsical allegory more than a regular\r\n    comedy. Plutus, the god of wealth, has been blinded by Zeus;\r\n    discovered in the guise of a ragged beggarman and succoured by\r\n    Chremylus, an old man who has ruined himself by generosity to his\r\n    friends, he is restored to sight by Aesculapius. He duly rewards\r\n    Chremylus, and henceforth apportions this world's goods among mankind\r\n    on juster principles--enriching the just, but condemning the unjust\r\n    to poverty.\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES\r\n\r\nList Of Editions, Commentaries, Etc., Used Or Consulted\r\n\r\nText: edit.

Introductory Chapter, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth play in order of time produced by Aristophanes on the\r\nAthenian stage; it was brought out at the Lenaean Festival, in January,\r\n424 B.C. Of the author's previous efforts, two, 'The Revellers' and 'The\r\nBabylonians,' were apparently youthful essays, and are both lost. The\r\nother, 'The Acharnians,' forms the first of the three Comedies dealing\r\ndirectly with the War and its disastrous effects and urging the\r\nconclusion of Peace; for this reason it is better ranged along with its\r\nsequels, the 'Peace' and the 'Lysistrata,' and considered in conjunction\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIn many respects 'The Knights' may be reckoned the great Comedian's\r\nmasterpiece, the direct personal attack on the then all-powerful Cleon,\r\nwith its scathing satire and tremendous invective, being one of the most\r\nvigorous and startling things in literature. Already in 'The Acharnians'\r\nhe had threatened to \"cut up Cleon the Tanner into shoe-leather for the\r\nKnights,\" and he now proceeds to carry his menace into execution,\r\n\"concentrating the whole force of his wit in the most unscrupulous and\r\nmerciless fashion against his personal enemy.\" In the first-mentioned\r\nplay Aristophanes had attacked and satirized the whole general policy of\r\nthe democratic party--and incidentally Cleon, its leading spirit and\r\nmouthpiece since the death of Pericles; he had painted the miseries of\r\nwar and invasion arising from this mistaken and mischievous line of\r\naction, as he regarded it, and had dwelt on the urgent necessity of peace\r\nin the interests of an exhausted country and ruined agriculture. Now he\r\nturns upon Cleon personally, and pays him back a hundredfold for the\r\nattacks the demagogue had made in the Public Assembly on the daring\r\ncritic, and the abortive charge which the same unscrupulous enemy had\r\nbrought against him in the Courts of having \"slandered the city in the\r\npresence of foreigners.\" \"In this bitterness of spirit the play stands in\r\nstrong contrast with the good-humoured burlesque of 'The Acharnians' and\r\nthe 'Peace,' or, indeed, with any other of the author's productions which\r\nhas reached us.\"\r\n\r\nThe characters are five only. First and foremost comes Demos, 'The\r\nPeople,' typifying the Athenian democracy, a rich householder--a\r\nself-indulgent, superstitious, weak creature. He has had several\r\noverseers or factors in succession, to look after his estate and manage\r\nhis slaves. The present one is known as 'the Paphlagonian,' or sometimes\r\nas 'the Tanner,' an unprincipled, lying, cheating, pilfering scoundrel,\r\nfawning and obsequious to his master, insolent towards his subordinates.\r\nTwo of these are Nicias and Demosthenes. Here we have real names. Nicias\r\nwas High Admiral of the Athenian navy at the time, and Demosthenes one of\r\nhis Vice-Admirals; both held still more important commands later in\r\nconnection with the Sicilian Expedition of 415-413 B.C. Fear of\r\nconsequences apparently prevented the poet from doing the same in the\r\ncase of Cleon, who is, of course, intended under the names of 'the\r\nPaphlagonian' and 'the Tanner.' Indeed, so great was the terror inspired\r\nby the great man that no artist was found bold enough to risk his\r\npowerful vengeance by caricaturing his features, and no actor dared to\r\nrepresent him on the stage. Aristophanes is said to have played the part\r\nhimself, with his face, in the absence of a mask, smeared with wine-lees,\r\nroughly mimicking the purple and bloated visage of the demagogue. The\r\nremaining character is 'the Sausage-seller,' who is egged on by Nicias\r\nand Demosthenes to oust 'the Paphlagonian' from Demos' favour by outvying\r\nhim in his own arts of impudent flattery, noisy boasting and unscrupulous\r\nallurement. After a fierce and stubbornly contested trial of wits and\r\ninterchange of 'Billingsgate,' 'the Sausage-seller' beats his rival at\r\nhis own weapons and gains his object; he supplants the disgraced\r\nfavourite, who is driven out of the house with ignominy.\r\n\r\nThe Comedy takes its title, as was often the case, from the Chorus, which\r\nis composed of Knights--the order of citizens next to the highest at\r\nAthens, and embodying many of the old aristocratic preferences and\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nThe drama was adjudged the first prize--the 'Satyrs' of Cratinus being\r\nplaced second--by acclamation, as such a masterpiece of wit and\r\nintrepidity certainly deserved to be; but, as usual, the political result\r\nwas nil. The piece was applauded in the most enthusiastic manner, the\r\nsatire on the sovereign multitude was forgiven, and--Cleon remained in as\r\nmuch favour as ever.[4]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES.\r\nNICIAS.\r\nAGORACRITUS, a Sausage-seller.\r\nCLEON.\r\nDEMOS, an old man, typifying the Athenian people.\r\nCHORUS OF KNIGHTS.\r\n\r\nSCENE: In front of Demos' house at Athens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! alas! alas! Oh! woe! oh! woe! Miserable Paphlagonian![5]\r\nmay the gods destroy both him and his cursed advice! Since that evil day\r\nwhen this new slave entered the house he has never ceased belabouring us\r\nwith blows.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. May the plague seize him, the arch-fiend--him and his lying\r\ntales!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Hah! my poor fellow, what is your condition?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Very wretched, just like your own.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Then come, let us sing a duet of groans in the style of\r\nOlympus.[6]\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES AND NICIAS. Boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo! boo, hoo!\r\nboo, hoo!!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Bah! 'tis lost labour to weep! Enough of groaning! Let us\r\nconsider how to save our pelts.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. But how to do it! Can you suggest anything?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Nay! you begin. I cede you the honour.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. By Apollo! no, not I. Come, have courage! Speak, and then I will\r\nsay what I think.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. \"Ah! would you but tell me what I should tell you!\"[7]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. I dare not. How could I express my thoughts with the pomp of\r\nEuripides?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! prithee, spare me! Do not pelt me with those\r\nvegetables,[8] but find some way of leaving our master.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Well, then! Say \"Let-us-bolt,\" like this, in one breath.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. I follow you--\"Let-us-bolt.\"\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Now after \"Let-us-bolt\" say \"at-top-speed!\"\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. \"At-top-speed!\"\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Splendid! Just as if you were masturbating yourself; first\r\nslowly, \"Let-us-bolt\"; then quick and firmly, \"at-top-speed!\"\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Let-us-bolt, let-us-bolt-at-top-speed![9]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Hah! does that not please you?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. I' faith, yes! yet I fear me your omen bodes no good to my\r\nhide.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. How so?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Because hard rubbing abrades the skin when folk masturbate\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. The best thing we can do for the moment is to throw ourselves at\r\nthe feet of the statue of some god.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Of which statue? Any statue? Do you then believe there are\r\ngods?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Certainly.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. What proof have you?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. The proof that they have taken a grudge against me. Is that not\r\nenough?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. I'm convinced it is. But to pass on. Do you consent to my\r\ntelling the spectators of our troubles?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. 'Twould not be amiss, and we might ask them to show us by their\r\nmanner, whether our facts and actions are to their liking.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. I will begin then. We have a very brutal master, a perfect\r\nglutton for beans,[10] and most bad-tempered; 'tis Demos of the Pnyx,[11]\r\nan intolerable old man and half deaf. The beginning of last month he\r\nbought a slave, a Paphlagonian tanner, an arrant rogue, the incarnation\r\nof calumny. This man of leather knows his old master thoroughly; he plays\r\nthe fawning cur, flatters, cajoles; wheedles, and dupes him at will with\r\nlittle scraps of leavings, which he allows him to get. \"Dear Demos,\" he\r\nwill say, \"try a single case and you will have done enough; then take\r\nyour bath, eat, swallow and devour; here are three obols.\"[12] Then the\r\nPaphlagonian filches from one of us what we have prepared and makes a\r\npresent of it to our old man. T'other day I had just kneaded a Spartan\r\ncake at Pylos;[13] the cunning rogue came behind my back, sneaked it and\r\noffered the cake, which was my invention, in his own name. He keeps us at\r\na distance and suffers none but himself to wait upon the master; when\r\nDemos is dining, he keeps close to his side with a thong in his hand and\r\nputs the orators to flight. He keeps singing oracles to him, so that the\r\nold man now thinks of nothing but the Sibyl. Then, when he sees him\r\nthoroughly obfuscated, he uses all his cunning and piles up lies and\r\ncalumnies against the household; then we are scourged and the\r\nPaphlagonian runs about among the slaves to demand contributions with\r\nthreats and gathers 'em in with both hands. He will say, \"You see how I\r\nhave had Hylas beaten! Either content me or die at once!\" We are forced\r\nto give, for else the old man tramples on us and makes us spew forth all\r\nour body contains. There must be an end to it, friend. Let us see! what\r\ncan be done? Who will get us out of this mess?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. The best thing, chum, is our famous \"Let-us-bolt!\"\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. But none can escape the Paphlagonian, his eye is everywhere.\r\nAnd what a stride! He has one leg on Pylos and the other in the Assembly;\r\nhis rump is exactly over the land of the Chaonians, his hands are with\r\nthe Aetolians and his mind with the Clopidians.[14]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. 'Tis best then to die; but let us seek the most heroic death.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Let me bethink me, what is the most heroic?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Let us drink the blood of a bull; 'tis the death which\r\nThemistocles chose.[15]\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. No, not that, but a bumper of good unmixed wine in honour of\r\nthe Good Genius;[16] perchance we may stumble on a happy thought.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Look at him! \"Unmixed wine!\" Your mind is on drink intent? Can a\r\nman strike out a brilliant thought when drunk?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Without question. Go, ninny, blow yourself out with water;\r\ndo you dare to accuse wine of clouding the reason? Quote me more\r\nmarvellous effects than those of wine. Look! when a man drinks, he is\r\nrich, everything he touches succeeds, he gains lawsuits, is happy and\r\nhelps his friends. Come, bring hither quick a flagon of wine, that I may\r\nsoak my brain and get an ingenious idea.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Eh, my god! What can your drinking do to help us?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Much. But bring it to me, while I take my seat. Once drunk,\r\nI shall strew little ideas, little phrases, little reasonings everywhere.\r\n\r\nNICIAS (_returning with a flagon_). It is lucky I was not caught in the\r\nhouse stealing the wine.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Tell me, what is the Paphlagonian doing now?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. The wretch has just gobbled up some confiscated cakes; he is\r\ndrunk and lies at full-length a-snoring on his hides.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Very well, come along, pour me out wine and plenty of it.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Take it and offer a libation to your Good Genius; taste, taste\r\nthe liquor of the genial soil of Pramnium.[17]\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh, Good Genius! 'Tis thy will, not mine.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Prithee, tell me, what is it?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Run indoors quick and steal the oracles of the Paphlagonian,\r\nwhile he is asleep.[18]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Bless me! I fear this Good Genius will be but a very Bad Genius\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. And set the flagon near me, that I may moisten my wit to\r\ninvent some brilliant notion.\r\n\r\nNICIAS (_enters the house and returns at once_). How the Paphlagonian\r\ngrunts and snores! I was able to seize the sacred oracle, which he was\r\nguarding with the greatest care, without his seeing me.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! clever fellow! Hand it here, that I may read. Come, pour\r\nme out some drink, bestir yourself! Let me see what there is in it. Oh!\r\nprophecy! Some drink! some drink! Quick!\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Well! what says the oracle?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Pour again.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Is \"pour again\" in the oracle?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh, Bacis![19]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. But what is in it?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Quick! some drink!\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Bacis is very dry!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! miserable Paphlagonian! This then is why you have so\r\nlong taken such precautions; your horoscope gave you qualms of terror.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. What does it say?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. It says here how he must end.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. And how?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. How? the oracle announces clearly that a dealer in oakum\r\nmust first govern the city.[20]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. First dealer. And after him, who?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. After him, a sheep-dealer.[21]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Two dealers, eh? And what is this one's fate?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. To reign until a greater scoundrel than he arises; then he\r\nperishes and in his place the leather-seller appears, the Paphlagonian\r\nrobber, the bawler, who roars like a torrent.[22]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. And the leather-seller must destroy the sheep-seller?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Yes.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Oh! woe is me! Where can another seller be found, is there ever a\r\none left?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. There is yet one, who plies a firstrate trade.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Tell me, pray, what is that?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. You really want to know?\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Yes.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Well then! 'tis a sausage-seller who must overthrow him.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. A sausage-seller! Ah! by Posidon! what a fine trade! But where\r\ncan this man be found?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Let us seek him.\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Lo! there he is, going towards the market-place; 'tis the gods,\r\nthe gods who send him!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. This way, this way, oh, lucky sausage-seller, come forward,\r\ndear friend, our saviour, the saviour of our city.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What is it? Why do you call me?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Come here, come and learn about your good luck, you who are\r\nFortune's favourite!\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Come! Relieve him of his basket-tray and tell him the oracle of\r\nthe god; I will go and look after the Paphlagonian.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. First put down all your gear, then worship the earth and the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Tis done. What is the matter?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Happiness, riches, power; to-day you have nothing, to-morrow\r\nyou will have all, oh! chief of happy Athens.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why not leave me to wash my tripe and to sell my sausages\r\ninstead of making game of me?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! the fool! Your tripe! Do you see these tiers of\r\npeople?[23]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. You shall be master to them all, governor of the market, of\r\nthe harbours, of the Pnyx; you shall trample the Senate under foot, be\r\nable to cashier the generals, load them with fetters, throw them into\r\ngaol, and you will play the debauchee in the Prytaneum.[24]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What! I?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. You, without a doubt. But you do not yet see all the glory\r\nawaiting you. Stand on your basket and look at all the islands that\r\nsurround Athens.[25]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I see them. What then?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Look at the storehouses and the shipping.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, I am looking.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Exists there a mortal more blest than you? Furthermore, turn\r\nyour right eye towards Caria and your left towards Chalcedon.[26]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Tis then a blessing to squint!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. No, but 'tis you who are going to trade away all this.\r\nAccording to the oracle you must become the greatest of men.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Just tell me how a sausage-seller can become a great man.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. That is precisely why you will be great, because you are a\r\nsad rascal without shame, no better than a common market rogue.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I do not hold myself worthy of wielding power.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Oh! by the gods! Why do you not hold yourself worthy? Have\r\nyou then such a good opinion of yourself? Come, are you of honest\r\nparentage?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By the gods! No! of very bad indeed.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Spoilt child of fortune, everything fits together to ensure\r\nyour greatness.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But I have not had the least education. I can only read,\r\nand that very badly.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. That is what may stand in your way, almost knowing how to\r\nread. The demagogues will neither have an educated nor an honest man;\r\nthey require an ignoramus and a rogue. But do not, do not let go this\r\ngift, which the oracle promises.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But what does the oracle say?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Faith! it is put together in very fine enigmatical style, as\r\nelegant as it is clear: \"When the eagle-tanner with the hooked claws\r\nshall seize a stupid dragon, a blood-sucker, it will be an end to the hot\r\nPaphlagonian pickled garlic. The god grants great glory to the\r\nsausage-sellers unless they prefer to sell their wares.\"\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. In what way does this concern me? Pray instruct my\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. The eagle-tanner is the Paphlagonian.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What do the hooked claws mean?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. It means to say, that he robs and pillages us with his\r\nclaw-like hands.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And the dragon?\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. That is quite clear. The dragon is long and so also is the\r\nsausage; the sausage like the dragon is a drinker of blood. Therefore the\r\noracle says, that the dragon will triumph over the eagle-tanner, if he\r\ndoes not let himself be cajoled with words.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The oracles of the gods summon me! Faith! I do not at all\r\nunderstand how I can be capable of governing the people.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Nothing simpler. Continue your trade. Mix and knead together\r\nall the state business as you do for your sausages. To win the people,\r\nalways cook them some savoury that pleases them. Besides, you possess all\r\nthe attributes of a demagogue; a screeching, horrible voice, a perverse,\r\ncross-grained nature and the language of the market-place. In you all is\r\nunited which is needful for governing. The oracles are in your favour,\r\neven including that of Delphi. Come, take a chaplet, offer a libation to\r\nthe god of Stupidity[27] and take care to fight vigorously.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Who will be my ally? for the rich fear the Paphlagonian\r\nand the poor shudder at the sight of him.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. You will have a thousand brave Knights,[28] who detest him,\r\non your side; also the honest citizens amongst the spectators, those who\r\nare men of brave hearts, and finally myself and the god. Fear not, you\r\nwill not see his features, for none have dared to make a mask resembling\r\nhim. But the public have wit enough to recognize him.[29]\r\n\r\nNICIAS. Oh! mercy! here is the Paphlagonian!\r\n\r\nCLEON. By the twelve gods! Woe betide you, who have too long been\r\nconspiring against Demos. What means this Chalcidian cup? No doubt you\r\nare provoking the Chalcidians to revolt. You shall be killed, butchered,\r\nyou brace of rogues.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. What! are you for running away? Come, come, stand firm, bold\r\nSausage-seller, do not betray us. To the rescue, oh! Knights. Now is the\r\ntime. Simon, Panaetius,[30] get you to the right wing; they are coming\r\non; hold tight and return to the charge. I can see the dust of their\r\nhorses' hoofs; they are galloping to our aid. Courage! Repel, attack\r\nthem, put them to flight.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Strike, strike the villain, who has spread confusion amongst the\r\nranks of the Knights, this public robber, this yawning gulf of plunder,\r\nthis devouring Charybdis,[31] this villain, this villain, this villain! I\r\ncannot say the word too often, for he _is_ a villain a thousand times a\r\nday. Come, strike, drive, hurl him over and crush him to pieces; hate him\r\nas we hate him; stun him with your blows and your shouts. And beware lest\r\nhe escape you; he knows the way Eucrates[32] took straight to a bran sack\r\nfor concealment.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! veteran Heliasts,[33] brotherhood of the three obols,[34] whom\r\nI fostered by bawling at random, help me; I am being beaten to death by\r\nrebels.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. And 'tis justice; you devour the public funds that all should\r\nshare in; you treat the officers answerable for the revenue like the\r\nfruit of the fig tree, squeezing them to find which are still green or\r\nmore or less ripe; and, when you find one simple and timid, you force him\r\nto come from the Chersonese,[35] then you seize him by the middle,\r\nthrottle him by the neck, while you twist his shoulder back; he falls and\r\nyou devour him.[36] Besides, you know very well how to select from among\r\nthe citizens those who are as meek as lambs, rich, without guile and\r\nloathers of lawsuits.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Eh! what! Knights, are you helping them? But, if I am beaten, 'tis\r\nin your cause, for I was going to propose to erect you a statue in the\r\ncity in memory of your bravery.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! the impostor! the dull varlet! See! he treats us like old\r\ndotards and crawls at our feet to deceive us; but the cunning wherein\r\nlies his power shall this time recoil on himself; he trips up himself by\r\nresorting to such artifices.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh Citizens! oh people! see how these brutes are bursting my\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What shouts! but 'tis this very bawling that incessantly upsets\r\nthe city!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I can shout too--and so loud that you will flee with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. If you shout louder than he does, I will strike up the triumphal\r\nhymn; if you surpass him in impudence, the cake is ours.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I denounce this fellow; he has had tasty stews exported from\r\nAthens for the Spartan fleet.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I denounce him, who runs into the Prytaneum with\r\nempty belly and comes out with it full.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. And by Zeus! he carries off bread, meat, and fish, which is\r\nforbidden. Pericles himself never had this right.\r\n\r\nCLEON. You are travelling the right road to get killed.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I'll bawl three times as loud as you.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will deafen you with my yells.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I you with my bellowing.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I shall calumniate you, if you become a Strategus.[37]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Dog, I will lay your back open with the lash.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will make you drop your arrogance.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will baffle your machinations.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Dare to look me in the face!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I too was brought up in the market-place.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will cut you to shreds if you whisper a word.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will daub you with dung if you open your mouth.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I own I am a thief; do you admit yourself another.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By our Hermes of the market-place, if caught in the act,\r\nwhy, I perjure myself before those who saw me.\r\n\r\nCLEON. These are my own special tricks. I will denounce you to the\r\nPrytanes[38] as the owner of sacred tripe, that has not paid tithe.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! you scoundrel! you impudent bawler! everything is filled with\r\nyour daring, all Attica, the Assembly, the Treasury, the decrees, the\r\ntribunals. As a furious torrent you have overthrown our city; your\r\noutcries have deafened Athens and, posted upon a high rock, you have lain\r\nin wait for the tribute moneys as the fisherman does for the tunny-fish.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I know your tricks; 'tis an old plot resoled.[39]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you know naught of soling, I understand nothing of\r\nsausages; you, who cut bad leather on the slant to make it look stout and\r\ndeceive the country yokels. They had not worn it a day before it had\r\nstretched some two spans.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES 'Tis the very trick he served me; both my neighbours and my\r\nfriends laughed heartily at me, and before I reached Pergasae[40] I was\r\nswimming in my shoes.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Have you not always shown that blatant impudence, which is the\r\nsole strength of our orators? You push it so far, that you, the head of\r\nthe State, dare to milk the purses of the opulent aliens and, at sight of\r\nyou, the son of Hippodamus[41] melts into tears. But here is another man,\r\nwho gives me pleasure, for he is a much greater rascal than you; he will\r\noverthrow you; 'tis easy to see, that he will beat you in roguery, in\r\nbrazenness and in clever turns. Come, you, who have been brought up among\r\nthe class which to-day gives us all our great men, show us that a liberal\r\neducation is mere tomfoolery.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Just hear what sort of fellow that fine citizen is.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Will you not let me speak?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Assuredly not, for I also am a sad rascal.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. If he does not give in at that, tell him your parents were sad\r\nrascals too.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Once more, will you not let me speak?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, by Zeus!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Yes, by Zeus, but you shall!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, by Posidon! We will fight first to see who shall\r\nspeak first.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will die sooner.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will not let you....\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Let him, in the name of the gods, let him die.\r\n\r\nCLEON. What makes you so bold as to dare to speak to my face?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Tis that I know both how to speak and how to cook.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Hah! the fine speaker! Truly, if some business matter fell your\r\nway, you would know thoroughly well how to attack it, to carve it up\r\nalive! Shall I tell you what has happened to you? Like so many others,\r\nyou have gained some petty lawsuit against some alien.[42] Did you drink\r\nenough water to inspire you? Did you mutter over the thing sufficiently\r\nthrough the night, spout it along the street, recite it to all you met?\r\nHave you bored your friends enough with it? 'Tis then for this you deem\r\nyourself an orator. Ah! poor fool!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And what do you drink yourself then, to be able all alone\r\nby yourself to dumbfound and stupefy the city so with your clamour?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Can you match me with a rival? Me! When I have devoured a good hot\r\ntunny-fish and drunk on top of it a great jar of unmixed wine, I hold up\r\nthe Generals of Pylos to public scorn.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, when I have bolted the tripe of an ox together\r\nwith a sow's belly and swallowed the broth as well, I am fit, though\r\nslobbering with grease, to bellow louder than all orators and to terrify\r\nNicias.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. I admire your language so much; the only thing I do not approve\r\nis that you swallow all the broth yourself.\r\n\r\nCLEON. E'en though you gorged yourself on sea-dogs, you would not beat\r\nthe Milesians.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Give me a bullock's breast to devour, and I am a man to\r\ntraffic in mines.[43]\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will rush into the Senate and set them all by the ears.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I will lug out your gut to stuff like a sausage.\r\n\r\nCLEON. As for me, I will seize you by the rump and hurl you head foremost\r\nthrough the door.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. In any case, by Posidon, 'twill only be when you have thrown _me_\r\nthere first.[44]\r\n\r\nCLEON. Beware of the carcan![45]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I denounce you for cowardice.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will tan your hide.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will flay you and make a thief's pouch with the skin.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will peg you out on the ground.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will slice you into mince-meat.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will tear out your eyelashes.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will slit your gullet.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. We will set his mouth open with a wooden stick as the cooks\r\ndo with pigs; we will tear out his tongue, and, looking down his gaping\r\nthroat, will see whether his inside has any pimples.[46]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Thus then at Athens we have something more fiery than fire, more\r\nimpudent than impudence itself! 'Tis a grave matter; come, we will push\r\nand jostle him without mercy. There, you grip him tightly under the arms;\r\nif he gives way at the onset, you will find him nothing but a craven; I\r\nknow my man.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That he has been all his life and he has only made\r\nhimself a name by reaping another's harvest; and now he has tied up the\r\nears he gathered over there, he lets them dry and seeks to sell them.[47]\r\n\r\nCLEON. I do not fear you as long as there is a Senate and a people which\r\nstands like a fool, gaping in the air.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What unparalleled impudence! 'Tis ever the same brazen front. If\r\nI don't hate you, why, I'm ready to take the place of the one blanket\r\nCratinus wets;[48] I'll offer to play a tragedy by Morsimus.[49] Oh! you\r\ncheat! who turn all into money, who flutter from one extortion to\r\nanother; may you disgorge as quickly as you have crammed yourself! Then\r\nonly would I sing, \"Let us drink, let us drink to this happy event!\"[50]\r\nThen even the son of Iulius,[51] the old niggard, would empty his cup\r\nwith transports of joy, crying, \"Io, Paean! Io, Bacchus!\"\r\n\r\nCLEON. By Posidon! You! would you beat me in impudence! If you succeed,\r\nmay I no longer have my share of the victims offered to Zeus on the city\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, I swear by the blows that have so oft rained upon\r\nmy shoulders since infancy, and by the knives that have cut me, that I\r\nwill show more effrontery than you; as sure as I have rounded this fine\r\nstomach by feeding on the pieces of bread that had cleansed other folk's\r\ngreasy fingers.[52]\r\n\r\nCLEON. On pieces of bread, like a dog! Ah! wretch! you have the nature of\r\na dog and you dare to fight a cynecephalus?[53]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I have many another trick in my sack, memories of my\r\nchildhood's days. I used to linger around the cooks and say to them,\r\n\"Look, friends, don't you see a swallow? 'tis the herald of springtime.\"\r\nAnd while they stood, their noses in the air, I made off with a piece of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! most clever man! How well thought out! You did as the eaters\r\nof artichokes, you gathered them before the return of the swallows.[54]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. They could make nothing of it; or, if they suspected a\r\ntrick, I hid the meat in my breeches and denied the thing by all the\r\ngods; so that an orator, seeing me at the game, cried, \"This child will\r\nget on; he has the mettle that makes a statesman.\"\r\n\r\nCHORUS. He argued rightly; to steal, perjure yourself and make a receiver\r\nof your rump[55] are three essentials for climbing high.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will stop your insolence, or rather the insolence of both of\r\nyou. I will throw myself upon you like a terrible hurricane ravaging both\r\nland and sea at the will of its fury.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Then I will gather up my sausages and entrust myself to\r\nthe kindly waves of fortune so as to make you all the more enraged.\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. And I will watch in the bilges in case the boat should make\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nCLEON. No, by Demeter! I swear, 'twill not be with impunity that you have\r\nthieved so many talents from the Athenians.[56]\r\n\r\nCHORUS (_to the Sausage-seller_). Oh! oh! reef your sail a bit! Here is\r\nBoreas blowing calumniously.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I know that you got ten talents out of Potidaea.[57]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Hold! I will give you one; but keep it dark!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hah! that will please him mightily; now you can travel under full\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, the wind has lost its violence.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will bring four suits against you, each of one hundred\r\ntalents.[58]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I twenty against you for shirking duty and more than\r\na thousand for robbery.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I maintain that your parents were guilty of sacrilege against the\r\ngoddess.[59]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, that one of your grandfathers was a satellite....\r\n\r\nCLEON. To whom? Explain!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. To Byrsina, the mother of Hippias.[60]\r\n\r\nCLEON. You are an impostor.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And you are a rogue.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hit him hard.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh, oh, dear! The conspirators are murdering me!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Strike, strike with all your might; bruise his belly, lashing him\r\nwith your guts and your tripe; punish him with both arms! Oh! vigorous\r\nassailant and intrepid heart! Have you not routed him totally in this\r\nduel of abuse? how shall I give tongue to my joy and sufficiently praise\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Ah! by Demeter! I was not ignorant of this plot against me; I knew\r\nit was forming, that the chariot of war was being put together.[61]\r\n\r\nCHORUS (_to Sausage-seller_). Look out, look out! Come, outfence him with\r\nsome wheelwright slang?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. His tricks at Argos do not escape me. Under pretence of\r\nforming an alliance with the Argives, he is hatching a plot with the\r\nLacedaemonians there; and I know why the bellows are blowing and the\r\nmetal that is on the anvil; 'tis the question of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well done! Forge on, if he be a wheelwright.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And there are men at Sparta[62] who are hammering the\r\niron with you; but neither gold nor silver nor prayers nor anything else\r\nshall impede my denouncing your trickery to the Athenians.\r\n\r\nCLEON. As for me, I hasten to the Senate to reveal your plotting, your\r\nnightly gatherings in the city, your trafficking with the Medes and with\r\nthe Great King, and all you are foraging for in Boeotia.[63]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What price then is paid for forage by Boeotians?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! by Heracles! I will tan your hide.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, if you have both wit and heart, now is the time to show it,\r\nas on the day when you hid the meat in your breeches, as you say. Hasten\r\nto the Senate, for he will rush there like a tornado to calumniate us all\r\nand give vent to his fearful bellowings.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I am going, but first I must rid myself of my tripe and\r\nmy knives; I will leave them here.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Stay! rub your neck with lard; in this way you will slip between\r\nthe fingers of calumny.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Spoken like a finished master of fence.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Now, bolt down these cloves of garlic.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Pray, what for?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well primed with garlic, you will have greater mettle for the\r\nfight. But hurry, hurry, bestir yourself!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That's just what I am doing.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. And, above all, bite your foe, rend him to atoms, tear off his\r\ncomb[64] and do not return until you have devoured his wattles. Go! make\r\nyour attack with a light heart, avenge me and may Zeus guard you! I burn\r\nto see you return the victor and laden with chaplets of glory. And you,\r\nspectators, enlightened critics of all kinds of poetry, lend an ear to my\r\nanapaests.[65]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Had one of the old authors asked to mount this stage to recite\r\nhis verses, he would not have found it hard to persuade me. But our poet\r\nof to-day is likewise worthy of this favour; he shares our hatred, he\r\ndares to tell the truth, he boldly braves both waterspouts and\r\nhurricanes. Many among you, he tells us, have expressed wonder, that he\r\nhas not long since had a piece presented in his own name, and have asked\r\nthe reason why.[66] This is what he bids us say in reply to your\r\nquestions; 'tis not without grounds that he has courted the shade, for,\r\nin his opinion, nothing is more difficult than to cultivate the comic\r\nMuse; many court her, but very few secure her favours. Moreover, he knows\r\nthat you are fickle by nature and betray your poets when they grow old.\r\nWhat fate befell Magnes,[67] when his hair went white? Often enough has\r\nhe triumphed over his rivals; he has sung in all keys, played the lyre\r\nand fluttered wings; he turned into a Lydian and even into a gnat, daubed\r\nhimself with green to become a frog.[68] All in vain! When young, you\r\napplauded him; in his old age you hooted and mocked him, because his\r\ngenius for raillery had gone. Cratinus[69] again was like a torrent of\r\nglory rushing across the plain, uprooting oak, plane tree and rivals and\r\nbearing them pell-mell in its wake. The only songs at the banquet were,\r\n'Doro, shod with lying tales' and 'Adepts of the Lyric Muse';[70] so\r\ngreat was his renown. Look at him now! he drivels, his lyre has neither\r\nstrings nor keys, his voice quivers, but you have no pity for him, and\r\nyou let him wander about as he can, like Connas,[71] his temples circled\r\nwith a withered chaplet; the poor old fellow is dying of thirst; he who,\r\nin honour of his glorious past, should be in the Prytaneum drinking at\r\nhis ease, and instead of trudging the country should be sitting amongst\r\nthe first row of the spectators, close to the statue of Dionysus[72] and\r\nloaded with perfumes. Crates,[73] again, have you done hounding him with\r\nyour rage and your hisses? True, 'twas but meagre fare that his sterile\r\nMuse could offer you; a few ingenious fancies formed the sole\r\ningredients, but nevertheless he knew how to stand firm and to recover\r\nfrom his falls. 'Tis such examples that frighten our poet; in addition,\r\nhe would tell himself, that before being a pilot, he must first know how\r\nto row, then to keep watch at the prow, after that how to gauge the\r\nwinds, and that only then would he be able to command his vessel.[74] If\r\nthen you approve this wise caution and his resolve that he would not bore\r\nyou with foolish nonsense, raise loud waves of applause in his favour\r\nthis day, so that, at this Lenaean feast, the breath of your favour may\r\nswell the sails of his trumphant galley and the poet may withdraw proud\r\nof his success, with head erect and his face beaming with delight.\r\n\r\nPosidon, god of the racing steed, I salute you, you who delight in their\r\nneighing and in the resounding clatter of their brass-shod hoofs, god of\r\nthe swift galleys, which, loaded with mercenaries, cleave the seas with\r\ntheir azure beaks, god of the equestrian contests, in which young rivals,\r\neager for glory, ruin themselves for the sake of distinction with their\r\nchariots in the arena, come and direct our chorus; Posidon with the\r\ntrident of gold, you, who reign over the dolphins, who are worshipped at\r\nSunium and at Geraestus[75] beloved of Phormio,[76] and dear to the whole\r\ncity above all the immortals, I salute you!\r\n\r\nLet us sing the glory of our forefathers; ever victors, both on land and\r\nsea, they merit that Athens, rendered famous by these, her worthy sons,\r\nshould write their deeds upon the sacred peplus.[77] As soon as they saw\r\nthe enemy, they at once sprang at him without ever counting his strength.\r\nShould one of them fall in the conflict, he would shake off the dust,\r\ndeny his mishap and begin the struggle anew. Not one of these Generals of\r\nold time would have asked Cleaenetus[78] to be fed at the cost of the\r\nstate; but our present men refuse to fight, unless they get the honours\r\nof the Prytaneum and precedence in their seats. As for us, we place our\r\nvalour gratuitously at the service of Athens and of her gods; our only\r\nhope is, that, should peace ever put a term to our toils, you will not\r\ngrudge us our long, scented hair nor our delicate care for our toilet.\r\n\r\nOh! Pallas, guardian of Athens, you, who reign over the most pious city,\r\nthe most powerful, the richest in warriors and in poets, hasten to my\r\ncall, bringing in your train our faithful ally in all our expeditions and\r\ncombats, Victory, who smiles on our choruses and fights with us against\r\nour rivals. Oh! goddess! manifest yourself to our sight; this day more\r\nthan ever we deserve that you should ensure our triumph.\r\n\r\nWe will sing likewise the exploits of our steeds! they are worthy of our\r\npraises;[79] in what invasions, what fights have I not seen them helping\r\nus! But especially admirable were they, when they bravely leapt upon the\r\ngalleys, taking nothing with them but a coarse wine, some cloves of\r\ngarlic and onions; despite this, they nevertheless seized the sweeps just\r\nlike men, curved their backs over the thwarts and shouted, \"Hippopopoh!\r\nGive way! Come, all pull together! Come, come! How! Samphoras![80] Are\r\nyou not rowing?\" They rushed down upon the coast of Corinth, and the\r\nyoungest hollowed out beds in the sand with their hoofs or went to fetch\r\ncoverings; instead of luzern, they had no food but crabs, which they\r\ncaught on the strand and even in the sea; so that Theorus causes a\r\nCorinthian[81] crab to say, \"'Tis a cruel fate, oh Posidon! neither my\r\ndeep hiding-places, whether on land or at sea, can help me to escape the\r\nKnights.\"\r\n\r\nWelcome, oh, dearest and bravest of men! How distracted I have been\r\nduring your absence! But here you are back, safe and sound. Tell us about\r\nthe fight you have had.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The important thing is that I have beaten the Senate.[82]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. All glory to you! Let us burst into shouts of joy! You speak\r\nwell, but your deeds are even better. Come, tell me everything in detail;\r\nwhat a long journey would I not be ready to take to hear your tale! Come,\r\ndear friend, speak with full confidence to your admirers.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The story is worth hearing. Listen! From here I rushed\r\nstraight to the Senate, right in the track of this man; he was already\r\nletting loose the storm, unchaining the lightning, crushing the Knights\r\nbeneath huge mountains of calumnies heaped together and having all the\r\nair of truth; he called you conspirators and his lies caught root like\r\nweeds in every mind; dark were the looks on every side and brows were\r\nknitted. When I saw that the Senate listened to him favourably and was\r\nbeing tricked by his imposture, I said to myself, \"Come, gods of rascals\r\nand braggarts, gods of all fools, toad-eaters and braggarts and thou,\r\nmarket-place, where I was bred from my earliest days, give me unbridled\r\naudacity, an untiring chatter and a shameless voice.\" No sooner had I\r\nended this prayer than a lewd man broke wind on my right. \"Hah! 'tis a\r\ngood omen,\" said I, and prostrated myself; then I burst open the door by\r\na vigorous push with my back, and, opening my mouth to the utmost,\r\nshouted, \"Senators, I wanted you to be the first to hear the good news;\r\nsince the War broke out, I have never seen anchovies at a lower price!\"\r\nAll faces brightened at once and I was voted a chaplet for my good\r\ntidings; and I added, \"With a couple of words I will reveal to you, how\r\nyou can have quantities of anchovies for an obol; 'tis to seize on all\r\nthe dishes the merchants have.\" With mouths gaping with admiration, they\r\napplauded me. However, the Paphlagonian winded the matter and, well\r\nknowing the sort of language which pleases the Senate best, said,\r\n\"Friends, I am resolved to offer one hundred oxen to the goddess in\r\nrecognition of this happy event.\" The Senate at once veered to his side.\r\nSo when I saw myself defeated by this ox filth, I outbade the fellow,\r\ncrying, \"Two hundred!\" And beyond this I moved, that a vow be made to\r\nDiana of a thousand goats if the next day anchovies should only be worth\r\nan obol a hundred. And the Senate looked towards me again. The other,\r\nstunned with the blow, grew delirious in his speech, and at last the\r\nPrytanes and the guards dragged him out. The Senators then stood talking\r\nnoisily about the anchovies. Cleon, however, begged them to listen to the\r\nLacedaemonian envoy, who had come to make proposals of peace; but all\r\nwith one accord, cried, \"'Tis certainly not the moment to think of peace\r\nnow! If anchovies are so cheap, what need have we of peace? Let the war\r\ntake its course!\" And with loud shouts they demanded that the Prytanes\r\nshould close the sitting and then leapt over the rails in all directions.\r\nAs for me, I slipped away to buy all the coriander seed and leeks there\r\nwere on the market and gave it to them gratis as seasoning for their\r\nanchovies. 'Twas marvellous! They loaded me with praises and caresses;\r\nthus I conquered the Senate with an obol's worth of leeks, and here I am.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Bravo! you are the spoilt child of Fortune. Ah! our knave has\r\nfound his match in another, who has far better tricks in his sack, a\r\nthousand kinds of knaveries and of wily words. But the fight begins\r\nafresh; take care not to weaken; you know that I have long been your most\r\nfaithful ally.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! ah! here comes the Paphlagonian! One would say, 'twas\r\na hurricane lashing the sea and rolling the waves before it in its fury.\r\nHe looks as if he wanted to swallow me up alive! Ye gods! what an\r\nimpudent knave!\r\n\r\nCLEON. To my aid, my beloved lies! I am going to destroy you, or my name\r\nis lost.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! how he diverts me with his threats! His bluster makes\r\nme laugh! And I dance the _mothon_ for joy,[83] and sing at the top of my\r\nvoice, cuckoo!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Ah! by Demeter! if I do not kill and devour you, may I die!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you do not devour me? and I, if I do not drink your\r\nblood to the last drop, and then burst with indigestion.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I, I will strangle you, I swear it by the precedence which Pylos\r\ngained me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. By the precedence! Ah! might I see you fall from your\r\nprecedence into the hindmost seat!\r\n\r\nCLEON. By heaven! I will put you to the torture.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What a lively wit! Come, what's the best to give you to\r\neat? What do you prefer? A purse?\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will tear out your inside with my nails.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I will cut off your victuals at the Prytaneum.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will haul you before Demos, who will mete out justice to you.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I too will drag you before him and belch forth more\r\ncalumnies than you.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Why, poor fool, he does not believe you, whereas I play with him\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. So that Demos is your property, your contemptible\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nCLEON. 'Tis because I know the dishes that please him.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And these are little mouthfuls, which you serve to him\r\nlike a clever nurse. You chew the pieces and place some in small\r\nquantities in his mouth, while you swallow three parts yourself.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Thanks to my skill, I know exactly how to enlarge or contract this\r\ngullet.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I can do as much with my rump.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Hah! my friend, you tricked me at the Senate, but have a care! Let\r\nus go before Demos.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That's easily done; come, let's along without delay.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh, Demos! Come, I adjure you to help me, my father!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Come, oh, my dear little Demos; come and see how I am\r\ninsulted.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What a hubbub! To the Devil with you, bawlers! alas! my olive\r\nbranch, which they have torn down![84] Ah! 'tis you, Paphlagonian. And\r\nwho, pray, has been maltreating you?\r\n\r\nCLEON. You are the cause of this man and these young people having\r\ncovered me with blows.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And why?\r\n\r\nCLEON Because you love me passionately, Demos.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And you, who are you?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. His rival. For many a long year have I loved you, have I\r\nwished to do you honour, I and a crowd of other men of means. But this\r\nrascal here has prevented us. You resemble those young men who do not\r\nknow where to choose their lovers; you repulse honest folk; to earn your\r\nfavours, one has to be a lamp-seller, a cobbler, a tanner or a currier.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I am the benefactor of the people.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. In what way, an it please you?\r\n\r\nCLEON. In what way? I supplanted the Generals at Pylos, I hurried thither\r\nand I brought back the Laconian captives.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, whilst simply loitering, cleared off with a pot\r\nfrom a shop, which another fellow had been boiling.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Demos, convene the assembly at once to decide which of us two\r\nloves you best and most merits your favour.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Yes, yes, provided it be not at the Pnyx.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. I could not sit elsewhere; 'tis at the Pnyx, that you must appear\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! great gods! I am undone! At home this old fellow is\r\nthe most sensible of men, but the instant he is seated on those cursed\r\nstone seats,[85] he is there with mouth agape as if he were hanging up\r\nfigs by their stems to dry.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, loose all sail. Be bold, skilful in attack and entangle him\r\nin arguments which admit of no reply. It is difficult to beat him, for he\r\nis full of craft and pulls himself out of the worst corners. Collect all\r\nyour forces to come forth from this fight covered with glory, but take\r\ncare! Let him not assume the attack, get ready your grapples and advance\r\nwith your vessel to board him!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! guardian goddess of our city! oh! Athené! if it be true that\r\nnext to Lysicles, Cynna and Salabaccha[86] none have done so much good\r\nfor the Athenian people as I, suffer me to continue to be fed at the\r\nPrytaneum without working; but if I hate you, if I am not ready to fight\r\nin your defence alone and against all, may I perish, be sawn to bits\r\nalive and my skin be cut up into thongs.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I, Demos, if it be not true, that I love and cherish\r\nyou, may I be cooked in a stew; and if that is not saying enough, may I\r\nbe grated on this table with some cheese and then hashed, may a hook be\r\npassed through my testicles and let me be dragged thus to the\r\nCeramicus![87]\r\n\r\nCLEON. Is it possible, Demos, to love you more than I do? And firstly, as\r\nlong as you have governed with my consent, have I not filled your\r\ntreasury, putting pressure on some, torturing others or begging of them,\r\nindifferent to the opinion of private individuals, and solely anxious to\r\nplease you?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. There is nothing so wonderful in all that, Demos; I will\r\ndo as much; I will thieve the bread of others to serve up to you. No, he\r\nhas neither love for you nor kindly feeling; his only care is to warm\r\nhimself with your wood, and I will prove it. You, who, sword in hand,\r\nsaved Attica from the Median yoke at Marathon; you, whose glorious\r\ntriumphs we love to extol unceasingly, look, he cares little whether he\r\nsees you seated uncomfortably upon a stone; whereas I, I bring you this\r\ncushion, which I have sewn with my own hands. Rise and try this nice soft\r\nseat. Did you not put enough strain on your breeches at Salamis?[88]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Who are you then? Can you be of the race of Harmodius?[89] Upon my\r\nfaith, 'tis nobly done and like a true friend of Demos.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Petty flattery to prove him your goodwill!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But you have caught him with even smaller baits!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Never had Demos a defender or a friend more devoted than myself;\r\non my head, on my life, I swear it!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You pretend to love him and for eight years you have seen\r\nhim housed in casks, in crevices and dovecots,[90] where he is blinded\r\nwith the smoke, and you lock him in without pity; Archeptolemus brought\r\npeace and you tore it to ribbons; the envoys who come to propose a truce\r\nyou drive from the city with kicks in their backsides.\r\n\r\nCLEON. This is that Demos may rule over all the Greeks; for the oracles\r\npredict that, if he is patient, he must one day sit as judge in Arcadia\r\nat five obols per day. Meanwhile, I will nourish him, look after him and,\r\nabove all, I will ensure to him his three obols.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, little you care for his reigning in Arcadia, 'tis to\r\npillage and impose on the allies at will that you reckon; you wish the\r\nWar to conceal your rogueries as in a mist, that Demos may see nothing of\r\nthem, and harassed by cares, may only depend on yourself for his bread.\r\nBut if ever peace is restored to him, if ever he returns to his lands to\r\ncomfort himself once more with good cakes, to greet his cherished olives,\r\nhe will know the blessings you have kept him out of, even though paying\r\nhim a salary; and, filled with hatred and rage, he will rise, burning\r\nwith desire to vote against you. You know this only too well; 'tis for\r\nthis you rock him to sleep with your lies.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Is it not shameful, that you should dare thus to calumniate me\r\nbefore Demos, me, to whom Athens, I swear it by Demeter, already owes\r\nmore than it ever did to Themistocles?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! citizens of Argos, do you hear what he says?[91] You\r\ndare to compare yourself to Themistocles, who found our city half empty\r\nand left it full to overflowing, who one day gave us the Piraeus for\r\ndinner,[92] and added fresh fish to all our usual meals.[93] You, on the\r\ncontrary, you, who compare yourself with Themistocles, have only sought\r\nto reduce our city in size, to shut it within its walls, to chant oracles\r\nto us. And Themistocles goes into exile, while you gorge yourself on the\r\nmost excellent fare.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! Demos! Am I compelled to hear myself thus abused, and merely\r\nbecause I love you?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Silence! stop your abuse! All too long have I been your tool.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! my dear little Demos, he is a rogue, who has played\r\nyou many a scurvy trick; when your back is turned, he taps at the root\r\nthe lawsuits initiated by the peculators, swallows the proceeds wholesale\r\nand helps himself with both hands from the public funds.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Tremble, knave; I will convict you of having stolen thirty\r\nthousand drachmae.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. For a rascal of your kidney, you shout rarely! Well! I am\r\nready to die if I do not prove that you have accepted more than forty\r\nminae from the Mitylenaeans.[94]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This indeed may be termed talking. Oh, benefactor of the human\r\nrace, proceed and you will be the most illustrious of the Greeks. You\r\nalone shall have sway in Athens, the allies will obey you, and, trident\r\nin hand, you will go about shaking and overturning everything to enrich\r\nyourself. But, stick to your man, let him not go; with lungs like yours\r\nyou will soon have him finished.\r\n\r\nCLEON. No, my brave friends, no, you are running too fast; I have done a\r\nsufficiently brilliant deed to shut the mouth of all enemies, so long as\r\none of the bucklers of Pylos remains.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Of the bucklers! Hold! I stop you there and I hold you\r\nfast. For if it be true, that you love the people, you would not allow\r\nthese to be hung up with their rings;[95] but 'tis with an intent you\r\nhave done this. Demos, take knowledge of his guilty purpose; in this way\r\nyou no longer can punish him at your pleasure. Note the swarm of young\r\ntanners, who really surround him, and close to them the sellers of honey\r\nand cheese; all these are at one with him. Very well! you have but to\r\nfrown, to speak of ostracism and they will rush at night to these\r\nbucklers, take them down and seize our granaries.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Great gods! what! the bucklers retain their rings! Scoundrel! ah!\r\ntoo long have you had me for your tool, cheated and played with me!\r\n\r\nCLEON. But, dear sir, never you believe all he tells you. Oh! never will\r\nyou find a more devoted friend than me; unaided, I have known how to put\r\ndown the conspiracies; nothing that is a-hatching in the city escapes me,\r\nand I hasten to proclaim it loudly.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they\r\ncatch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is\r\ngood; in the same way 'tis only in troublous times that you line your\r\npockets. But come, tell me, you, who sell so many skins, have you ever\r\nmade him a present of a pair of soles for his slippers? and you pretend\r\nto love him!\r\n\r\nDEMOS. No, he has never given me any.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. That alone shows up the man; but I, I have bought you\r\nthis pair of shoes; accept them.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. None ever, to my knowledge, has merited so much from the people;\r\nyou are the most zealous of all men for your country and for my toes.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Can a wretched pair of slippers make you forget all that you owe\r\nme? Is it not I who curbed Gryttus,[96] the filthiest of the lewd, by\r\ndepriving him of his citizen rights?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! noble inspector of back passages, let me congratulate\r\nyou. Moreover, if you set yourself against this form of lewdness, this\r\npederasty, 'twas for sheer jealousy, knowing it to be the school for\r\norators.[97] But you see this poor Demos without a cloak and that at his\r\nage too! so little do you care for him, that in mid-winter you have not\r\ngiven him a garment with sleeves. Here, Demos, here is one, take it!\r\n\r\nDEMOS. This even Themistocles never thought of; the Piraeus was no doubt\r\na happy idea, but meseems this tunic is quite as fine an invention.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Must you have recourse to such jackanapes' tricks to supplant me?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, 'tis your own tricks that I am borrowing, just as a\r\nguest, driven by urgent need, seizes some other man's shoes.[98]\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! you shall not outdo me in flattery! I am going to hand Demos\r\nthis garment; all that remains to you, you rogue, is to go and hang\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Faugh! may the plague seize you! You stink of leather\r\nhorribly.[99]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why, 'tis to smother you that he has thrown this cloak\r\naround you on top of the other; and it is not the first plot he has\r\nplanned against you. Do you remember the time when silphium[100] was so\r\ncheap?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Aye, to be sure I do!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Very well! it was Cleon who had caused the price to fall\r\nso low so that all could eat it and the jurymen in the Courts were almost\r\npoisoned with farting in each others' faces.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Hah! why, indeed, a scavenger told me the same thing.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Were you not yourself in those days quite red in the\r\ngills with farting?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Why, 'twas a trick worthy of Pyrrandrus![101]\r\n\r\nCLEON. With what other idle trash will you seek to ruin me, you wretch!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! I shall be more brazen than you, for 'tis the goddess\r\nwho has commanded me.[102]\r\n\r\nCLEON. No, on my honour, you will not! Here, Demos, feast on this dish;\r\nit is your salary as a dicast, which you gain through me for doing\r\nnaught.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Hold! here is a little box of ointment to rub into the\r\nsores on your legs.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will pluck out your white hairs and make you young again.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Take this hare's scut to wipe the rheum from your eyes.\r\n\r\nCLEON. When you wipe your nose, clean your fingers on my head.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, on mine.\r\n\r\nCLEON. On mine. (_To the Sausage-seller._) I will have you made a\r\ntrierarch[103] and you will get ruined through it; I will arrange that\r\nyou are given an old vessel with rotten sails, which you will have to\r\nrepair constantly and at great cost.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Our man is on the boil; enough, enough, he is boiling over;\r\nremove some of the embers from under him and skim off his threats.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will punish your self-importance; I will crush you with imposts;\r\nI will have you inscribed on the list of the rich.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. For me no threats--only one simple wish. That you may be\r\nhaving some cuttle-fish fried on the stove just as you are going to set\r\nforth to plead the cause of the Milesians,[104] which, if you gain, means\r\na talent in your pocket; that you hurry over devouring the fish to rush\r\noff to the Assembly; suddenly you are called and run off with your mouth\r\nfull so as not to lose the talent and choke yourself. There! that is my\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Splendid! by Zeus, Apollo and Demeter!\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Faith! here is an excellent citizen indeed, such as has not been\r\nseen for a long time. 'Tis truly a man of the lowest scum! As for you,\r\nPaphlagonian, who pretend to love me, you only feed me on garlic. Return\r\nme my ring, for you cease to be my steward.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Here it is, but be assured, that if you bereave me of my power, my\r\nsuccessor will be worse than I am.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. This cannot be my ring; I see another device, unless I am going\r\npurblind.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What was your device?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. A fig-leaf, stuffed with bullock's fat.[105]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, that is not it.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What is it then?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Tis a gull with beak wide open, haranguing from the top\r\nof a stone.[106]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Ah! great gods!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What is the matter?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Away! away out of my sight! 'Tis not my ring he had, 'twas that of\r\nCleonymus. (_To the Sausage-seller_.) Hold, I give you this one; you\r\nshall be my steward.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Master, I adjure you, decide nothing till you have heard my\r\noracles.[107]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And mine.\r\n\r\nCLEON. If you believe him, you will have to suck his tool for him.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. If you listen to him, you'll have to let him skin your\r\npenis to the very stump.\r\n\r\nCLEON. My oracles say that you are to reign over the whole earth, crowned\r\nwith chaplets.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And mine say that, clothed in an embroidered purple robe,\r\nyou shall pursue Smicythes and her spouse,[108] standing in a chariot of\r\ngold and with a crown on your head.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Go, fetch me your oracles, that the Paphlagonian may hear them.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Willingly.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And you yours.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I run.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I run too; nothing could suit me better!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! happy day for us and for our children, if Cleon perish. Yet\r\njust now I heard some old cross-grained pleaders on the market-place who\r\nhold not this opinion discoursing together. Said they, \"If Cleon had not\r\nhad the power we should have lacked two most useful tools, the pestle and\r\nthe soup-ladle.\"[109] You also know what a pig's education he has had;\r\nhis school-fellows can recall that he only liked the Dorian style and\r\nwould study no other; his music-master in displeasure sent him away,\r\nsaying: \"This youth in matters of harmony, will only learn the Dorian\r\nstyle because 'tis akin to bribery.\"[110]\r\n\r\nCLEON. There, behold and look at this heap; and yet I do not bring all.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ugh! I pant and puff under the weight and yet I do not\r\nbring all.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What are these?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oracles.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. All these?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Does that astonish you? Why, I have another whole boxful of them.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I the whole of my attics and two rooms besides.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Come, let us see, whose are these oracles?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Mine are those of Bacis.[111]\r\n\r\nDEMOS (_to the Sausage-seller_). And whose are yours?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Glanis's, the elder brother of Bacis.[112]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And of what do they speak?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Of Athens, of Pylos, of you, of me, of all.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And yours?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Of Athens, of lentils, of Lacedaemonians, of fresh\r\nmackerel, of scoundrelly flour-sellers, of you, of me. Ah! ha! now let\r\nhim gnaw his own penis with chagrin!\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Come, read them out to me and especially that one I like so much,\r\nwhich says that I shall become an eagle and soar among the clouds.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Then listen and be attentive! \"Son of Erectheus,[113] understand\r\nthe meaning of the words, which the sacred tripods set resounding in the\r\nsanctuary of Apollo. Preserve the sacred dog with the jagged teeth, that\r\nbarks and howls in your defence; he will ensure you a salary and, if he\r\nfails, will perish as the victim of the swarms of jays that hunt him down\r\nwith their screams.\"\r\n\r\nDEMOS. By Demeter! I do not understand a word of it. What connection is\r\nthere between Erectheus, the jays and the dog?\r\n\r\nCLEON. 'Tis I who am the dog, since I bark in your defence. Well! Phoebus\r\ncommands you to keep and cherish your dog.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Tis not so spoken by the god; this dog seems to me to\r\ngnaw at the oracles as others gnaw at doorposts. Here is exactly what\r\nApollo says of the dog.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Let us hear, but I must first pick up a stone; an oracle which\r\nspeaks of a dog might bite me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \"Son of Erectheus, beware of this Cerberus that enslaves\r\nfreemen; he fawns upon you with his tail, when you are dining, but he is\r\nlying in wait to devour your dishes, should you turn your head an\r\ninstant; at night he sneaks into the kitchen and, true dog that he is,\r\nlicks up with one lap of his tongue both your dishes and ... the\r\nislands.\"[114]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Faith, Glanis, you speak better than your brother.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Condescend again to hear me and then judge: \"A woman in sacred\r\nAthens will be delivered of a lion, who shall fight for the people\r\nagainst clouds of gnats with the same ferocity as if he were defending\r\nhis whelps; care ye for him, erect wooden walls around him and towers of\r\nbrass.\" Do you understand that?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Not the least bit in the world.\r\n\r\nCLEON. The god tells you here to look after me, for, 'tis I who am your\r\nlion.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. How! You have become a lion and I never knew a thing about it?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. There is only one thing which he purposely keeps from\r\nyou; he does not say what this wall of wood and brass is in which Apollo\r\nwarns you to keep and guard him.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What does the god mean, then?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. He advises you to fit him into a five-holed wooden\r\ncollar.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Hah! I think that oracle is about to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Do not believe it; these are but jealous crows, that caw against\r\nme; but never cease to cherish your good hawk; never forget that he\r\nbrought you those Lacedaemonian fish, loaded with chains.[115]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! if the Paphlagonian ran any risk that day, 'twas\r\nbecause he was drunk. Oh, too credulous son of Cecrops,[116] do you\r\naccept that as a glorious exploit? A woman would carry a heavy burden if\r\nonly a man had put it on her shoulders. But to fight! Go to! he would\r\nshit himself, if ever it came to a tussle.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Note this Pylos in front of Pylos, of which the oracle speaks,\r\n\"Pylos is before Pylos.\"[117]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. How \"in front of Pylos\"? What does he mean by that?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. He says he will seize upon your bath-tubs.[118]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Then I shall not bathe to-day.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, as he has stolen our baths. But here is an oracle\r\nabout the fleet, to which I beg your best attention.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Read on! I am listening; let us first see how we are to pay our\r\nsailors.[119]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. \"Son of Aegeus,[120] beware of the tricks of the\r\ndog-fox,[121] he bites from the rear and rushes off at full speed; he is\r\nnothing but cunning and perfidy.\" Do you know what the oracle intends to\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. The dog-fox is Philostratus.[122]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, no, 'tis Cleon; he is incessantly asking you for\r\nlight vessels to go and collect the tributes, and Apollo advises you not\r\nto grant them.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What connection is there between a galley and a dog-fox?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. What connection? Why, 'tis quite plain--a galley travels\r\nas fast as a dog.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Why, then, does the oracle not say dog instead of dog-fox?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Because he compares the soldiers to young foxes, who,\r\nlike them, eat the grapes in the fields.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Good! Well then! how am I to pay the wages of my young foxes?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will undertake that, and in three days too! But listen\r\nto this further oracle, by which Apollo puts you on your guard against\r\nthe snares of the greedy fist.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Of what greedy fist?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The god in this oracle very clearly points to the hand of\r\nCleon, who incessantly holds his out, saying, \"Fill it.\"\r\n\r\nCLEON. 'Tis false! Phoebus means the hand of Diopithes.[123] But here I\r\nhave a winged oracle, which promises you shall become an eagle and rule\r\nover all the earth.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I have one, which says that you shall be King of the\r\nEarth and of the Sea, and that you shall administer justice in Ecbatana,\r\neating fine rich stews the while.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I have seen Athené[124] in a dream, pouring out full vials of\r\nriches and health over the people.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I too have seen the goddess, descending from the\r\nAcropolis with an owl perched upon her helmet; on your head she was\r\npouring out ambrosia, on that of Cleon garlic pickle.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Truly Glanis is the wisest of men. I shall yield myself to you;\r\nguide me in my old age and educate me anew.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Ah! I adjure you! not yet; wait a little; I will promise to\r\ndistribute barley every day.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Ah! I will not hear another word about barley; you have cheated me\r\ntoo often already, both you and Theophanes.[125]\r\n\r\nCLEON. Well then! you shall have flour-cakes all piping hot.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will give you cakes too, and nice cooked fish; you will\r\nonly have to eat.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Very well, mind you keep your promises. To whichever of you twain\r\nshall treat me best I hand over the reins of state.\r\n\r\nCLEON. I will be first.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. No, no, _I_ will.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Demos, you are our all-powerful sovereign lord; all tremble\r\nbefore you, yet you are led by the nose. You love to be flattered and\r\nfooled; you listen to the orators with gaping mouth and your mind is led\r\nastray.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. 'Tis rather you who have no brains, if you think me so foolish as\r\nall that; it is with a purpose that I play this idiot's role, for I love\r\nto drink the lifelong day, and so it pleases me to keep a thief for my\r\nminister. When he has thoroughly gorged himself, then I overthrow and\r\ncrush him.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What profound wisdom! If it be really so, why! all is for the\r\nbest. Your ministers, then, are your victims, whom you nourish and feed\r\nup expressly in the Pnyx, so that, the day your dinner is ready, you may\r\nimmolate the fattest and eat him.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Look, see how I play with them, while all the time they think\r\nthemselves such adepts at cheating me. I have my eye on them when they\r\nthieve, but I do not appear to be seeing them; then I thrust a judgment\r\ndown their throat as it were a feather, and force them to vomit up all\r\nthey have robbed from me.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! the rascal!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! the scoundrel!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Demos, all is ready these three hours; I await your orders and I\r\nburn with desire to load you with benefits.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I ten, twelve, a thousand hours, a long, long while,\r\nan infinitely long while.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. As for me, 'tis thirty thousand hours that I have been impatient;\r\nvery long, infinitely long that I have cursed you.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Do you know what you had best do?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. If I do not, tell me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Declare the lists open[126] and we will contend abreast\r\nto determine who shall treat you the best.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Splendid! Draw back in line![126]\r\n\r\nCLEON. I am ready.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Off you go!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER (_to Cleon_). I shall not let you get to the tape.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What fervent lovers! If I am not to-day the happiest of men, 'tis\r\nbecause I shall be the most disgusted.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Look! 'tis I who am the first to bring you a seat.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And I a table.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Hold, here is a cake kneaded of Pylos barley.[127]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE--SELLER. Here are crusts, which the ivory hand of the goddess has\r\nhallowed.[128]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Oh! Mighty Athené! How large are your fingers!\r\n\r\nCLEON. This is pea-soup, as exquisite as it is fine; 'tis Pallas the\r\nvictorious goddess at Pylos who crushed the peas herself.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh, Demos! the goddess watches over you; she is\r\nstretching forth over your head ... a stew-pan full of broth.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And should we still be dwelling in this city without this\r\nprotecting stew-pan?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Here are some fish, given to you by her who is the terror of our\r\nfoes.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The daughter of the mightiest of the gods sends you this\r\nmeat cooked in its own gravy, along with this dish of tripe and some\r\npaunch.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. 'Tis to thank me for the Peplos I offered to her; 'tis well.\r\n\r\nCLEON. The goddess with the terrible plume invites you to eat this long\r\ncake; you will row the harder on it.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Take this also.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And what shall I do with this tripe?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. She sends it you to belly out your galleys, for she is\r\nalways showing her kindly anxiety for our fleet. Now drink this beverage\r\ncomposed of three parts of water to two of wine.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Ah! what delicious wine, and how well it stands the water.[129]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Twas the goddess who came from the head of Zeus that\r\nmixed this liquor with her own hands.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Hold, here is a piece of good rich cake.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But I offer you an entire cake.\r\n\r\nCLEON. But you cannot offer him stewed hare as I do.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Ah! great gods! stewed hare! where shall I find it? Oh!\r\nbrain of mine, devise some trick!\r\n\r\nCLEON. Do you see this, poor fellow?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. A fig for that! Here are folk coming to seek me.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Who are they?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Envoys, bearing sacks bulging with money.\r\n\r\nCLEON. (_Hearing money mentioned Clean turns his head, and Agoracritus\r\nseizes the opportunity to snatch away the stewed hare._) Where, where, I\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Bah! What's that to you? Will you not even now let the\r\nstrangers alone? Demos, do you see this stewed hare which I bring you?\r\n\r\nCLEON. Ah! rascal! you have shamelessly robbed me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. You have robbed too, you robbed the Laconians at Pylos.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. An you pity me, tell me, how did you get the idea to filch it from\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. The idea comes from the goddess; the theft is all my own.\r\n\r\nCLEON. And I had taken such trouble to catch this hare.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But 'twas I who had it cooked.\r\n\r\nDEMOS (_to Cleon_). Get you gone! My thanks are only for him who served\r\nit.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Ah! wretch! have you beaten me in impudence!\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Well then, Demos, say now, who has treated you best, you\r\nand your stomach? Decide!\r\n\r\nDEMOS. How shall I act here so that the spectators shall approve my\r\njudgment?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I will tell you. Without saying anything, go and rummage\r\nthrough my basket, and then through the Paphlagonian's, and see what is\r\nin them; that's the best way to judge.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Let us see then, what is there in yours?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Why, 'tis empty, dear little father; I have brought\r\neverything to you.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. This is a basket devoted to the people.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Now hunt through the Paphlagonian's. Well?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Oh! what a lot of good things! Why! 'tis quite full! Oh! what a\r\nhuge great part of this cake he kept for himself! He had only cut off the\r\nleast little tiny piece for me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. But this is what he has always done. Of everything he\r\ntook, he only gave you the crumbs, and kept the bulk.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Oh! rascal! was this the way you robbed me? And I was loading you\r\nwith chaplets and gifts!\r\n\r\nCLEON. 'Twas for the public weal I robbed.\r\n\r\nDEMOS (_to Cleon_). Give me back that crown;[130] I will give it to him.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Return it quick, quick, you gallows-bird.\r\n\r\nCLEON. No, for the Pythian oracle has revealed to me the name of him who\r\nshall overthrow me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. And that name was mine, nothing can be clearer.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Reply and I shall soon see whether you are indeed the man whom the\r\ngod intended. Firstly, what school did you attend when a child?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. 'Twas in the kitchens I was taught with cuffs and blows.\r\n\r\nCLEON. What's that you say? Ah! this is truly what the oracle said. And\r\nwhat did you learn from the master of exercises?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I learnt to take a false oath without a smile, when I had\r\nstolen something.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! Phoebus Apollo, god of Lycia! I am undone! And when you had\r\nbecome a man, what trade did you follow?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. I sold sausages and did a bit of fornication.\r\n\r\nCLEON. Oh! my god! I am a lost man! Ah! still one slender hope remains.\r\nTell me, was it on the market-place or near the gates that you sold your\r\nsausages?\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Near the gates, in the market for salted goods.\r\n\r\nCLEON Alas! I see the prophecy of the god is verily come true. Alas! roll\r\nme home.[131] I am a miserable, ruined man. Farewell, my chaplet! 'Tis\r\ndeath to me to part with you. So you are to belong to another; 'tis\r\ncertain he cannot be a greater thief, but perhaps he may be a luckier\r\none.[132]\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. Oh! Zeus, the protector of Greece! 'tis to you I owe this\r\nvictory!\r\n\r\nDEMOSTHENES. Hail! illustrious conqueror, but forget not, that if you\r\nhave become a great man, 'tis thanks to me; I ask but a little thing;\r\nappoint me secretary of the law-court in the room of Phanus.\r\n\r\nDEMOS (_to the Sausage-seller_). But what is your name then? Tell me.\r\n\r\nSAUSAGE-SELLER. My name is Agoracritus, because I have always lived on\r\nthe market-place in the midst of lawsuits.[133]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Well then, Agoracritus, I stand by you; as for the Paphlagonian, I\r\nhand him over to your mercy.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Demos, I will care for you to the best of my power, and all\r\nshall admit that no citizen is more devoted than I to this city of\r\nsimpletons.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What fitter theme for our Muse, at the close as at the beginning\r\nof his work, than this, to sing the hero who drives his swift steeds down\r\nthe arena? Why afflict Lysistratus with our satires on his poverty,[134]\r\nand Thumantis,[135] who has not so much as a lodging? He is dying of\r\nhunger and can be seen at Delphi, his face bathed in tears, clinging to\r\nyour quiver, oh, Apollo! and supplicating you to take him out of his\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nAn insult directed at the wicked is not to be censured; on the contrary,\r\nthe honest man, if he has sense, can only applaud. Him, whom I wish to\r\nbrand with infamy, is little known himself; 'tis the brother of\r\nArignotus.[136] I regret to quote this name which is so dear to me, but\r\nwhoever can distinguish black from white, or the Orthian mode of music\r\nfrom others, knows the virtues of Arignotus, whom his brother,\r\nAriphrades,[137] in no way resembles. He gloats in vice, is not merely a\r\ndissolute man and utterly debauched--but he has actually invented a new\r\nform of vice; for he pollutes his tongue with abominable pleasures in\r\nbrothels licking up that nauseous moisture and befouling his beard as he\r\ntickles the lips of lewd women's private parts.[138] Whoever is not\r\nhorrified at such a monster shall never drink from the same cup with me.\r\n\r\nAt times a thought weighs on me at night; I wonder whence comes this\r\nfearful voracity of Cleonymus.[139] 'Tis said, that when dining with a\r\nrich host, he springs at the dishes with the gluttony of a wild beast and\r\nnever leaves the bread-bin until his host seizes him round the knees,\r\nexclaiming, \"Go, go, good gentleman, in mercy go, and spare my poor\r\ntable!\"\r\n\r\n'Tis said that the triremes assembled in council and that the oldest\r\nspoke in these terms, \"Are you ignorant, my sisters, of what is plotting\r\nin Athens? They say, that a certain Hyperbolus,[140] a bad citizen and an\r\ninfamous scoundrel, asks for a hundred of us to take them to sea against\r\nChalcedon.\"[141] All were indignant, and one of them, as yet a virgin,\r\ncried, \"May god forbid that I should ever obey him! I would prefer to\r\ngrow old in the harbour and be gnawed by worms. No! by the gods I swear\r\nit, Nauphanté, daughter of Nauson, shall never bend to his law; 'tis as\r\ntrue as I am made of wood and pitch. If the Athenians vote for the\r\nproposal of Hyperbolus, let them! we will hoist full sail and seek refuge\r\nby the temple of Theseus or the shrine of the Euminides.[142] No! he\r\nshall not command us! No! he shall not play with the city to this extent!\r\nLet him sail by himself for Tartarus, if such please him, launching the\r\nboats in which he used to sell his lamps.\"\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Maintain a holy silence! Keep your mouths from utterance!\r\ncall no more witnesses; close these tribunals, which are the delight of\r\nthis city, and gather at the theatre to chant the Paean of thanksgiving\r\nto the gods for a fresh favour.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! torch of sacred Athens, saviour of the Islands, what good\r\ntidings are we to celebrate by letting the blood of the victims flow in\r\nour market-places?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. I have freshened Demos up somewhat on the stove and have\r\nturned his ugliness into beauty.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. I admire your inventive genius; but, where is he?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. He is living in ancient Athens, the city of the garlands of\r\nviolets.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. How I should like to see him! What is his dress like, what his\r\nmanner?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. He has once more become as he was in the days when he lived\r\nwith Aristides and Miltiades. But you will judge for yourselves, for I\r\nhear the vestibule doors opening. Hail with your shouts of gladness the\r\nAthens of old, which now doth reappear to your gaze, admirable, worthy of\r\nthe songs of the poets and the home of the illustrious Demos.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! noble, brilliant Athens, whose brow is wreathed with violets,\r\nshow us the sovereign master of this land and of all Greece.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Lo! here he is coming with his hair held in place with a\r\ngolden band and in all the glory of his old-world dress; perfumed with\r\nmyrrh, he spreads around him not the odour of lawsuits, but of peace.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hail! King of Greece, we congratulate you upon the happiness you\r\nenjoy; it is worthy of this city, worthy of the glory of Marathon.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Come, Agoracritus, come, my best friend; see the service you have\r\ndone me by freshening me up on your stove.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Ah! if you but remembered what you were formerly and what\r\nyou did, you would for a certainty believe me to be a god.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. But what did I? and how was I then?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Firstly, so soon as ever an orator declared in the assembly\r\n\"Demos, I love you ardently; 'tis I alone, who dream of you and watch\r\nover your interests\"; at such an exordium you would look like a cock\r\nflapping his wings or a bull tossing his horns.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What, I?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Then, after he had fooled you to the hilt, he would go.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. What! they would treat me so, and I never saw it!\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. You knew only how to open and close your ears like a\r\nsunshade.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Was I then so stupid and such a dotard?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Worse than that; if one of two orators proposed to equip a\r\nfleet for war and the other suggested the use of the same sum for paying\r\nout to the citizens, 'twas the latter who always carried the day. Well!\r\nyou droop your head! you turn away your face?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. I redden at my past errors.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Think no more of them; 'tis not you who are to blame, but\r\nthose who cheated you in this sorry fashion. But, come, if some impudent\r\nlawyer dared to say, \"Dicasts, you shall have no wheat unless you convict\r\nthis accused man!\" what would you do? Tell me.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. I would have him removed from the bar, I would bind Hyperbolus\r\nabout his neck like a stone and would fling him into the Barathrum.[143]\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Well spoken! but what other measures do you wish to take?\r\n\r\nDEMOS. First, as soon as ever a fleet returns to the harbour, I shall pay\r\nup the rowers in full.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. That will soothe many a worn and chafed bottom.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Further, the hoplite enrolled for military service shall not get\r\ntransferred to another service through favour, but shall stick to that\r\ngiven him at the outset.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. This will strike the buckler of Cleonymus full in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. None shall ascend the rostrum, unless their chins are bearded.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. What then will become of Clisthenes and of Strato?[144]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. I wish only to refer to those youths, who loll about the perfume\r\nshops, babbling at random, \"What a clever fellow is Pheax![145] How\r\ncleverly he escaped death! how concise and convincing is his style! what\r\nphrases! how clear and to the point! how well he knows how to quell an\r\ninterruption!\"\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. I thought you were the lover of those pathic minions.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. The gods forefend it! and I will force all such fellows to go\r\na-hunting instead of proposing decrees.\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. In that case, accept this folding-stool, and to carry it\r\nthis well-grown, big-testicled slave lad. Besides, you may put him to any\r\nother purpose you please.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Oh! I am happy indeed to find myself as I was of old!\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. Aye, you deem yourself happy, when I shall have handed you\r\nthe truces of thirty years. Truces! step forward![146]\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Great gods! how charming they are! Can I do with them as I wish?\r\nwhere did you discover them, pray?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. 'Twas that Paphlagonian who kept them locked up in his\r\nhouse, so that you might not enjoy them. As for myself, I give them to\r\nyou; take them with you into the country.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. And what punishment will you inflict upon this Paphlagonian, the\r\ncause of all my troubles?\r\n\r\nAGORACRITUS. 'Twill not be over-terrible. I condemn him to follow my old\r\ntrade; posted near the gates, he must sell sausages of asses' and\r\ndogs'-meat; perpetually drunk, he will exchange foul language with\r\nprostitutes and will drink nothing but the dirty water from the baths.\r\n\r\nDEMOS. Well conceived! he is indeed fit to wrangle with harlots and\r\nbathmen; as for you, in return for so many blessings, I invite you to\r\ntake the place at the Prytaneum which this rogue once occupied. Put on\r\nthis frog-green mantle and follow me. As for the other, let 'em take him\r\naway; let him go sell his sausages in full view of the foreigners, whom\r\nhe used formerly so wantonly to insult.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFINIS OF \"THE KNIGHTS\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[4] Mitchell's \"Aristophanes.\" Preface to \"The Knights.\"\r\n\r\n[5] A generic name, used to denote a slave, because great numbers came\r\nfrom Paphlagonia, a country in Asia Minor. Aristophanes also plays upon\r\nthe word, [Greek: Paphlag_on], Paphlagonian, and the verb, [Greek:\r\npathlazein], to boil noisily, thus alluding to Cleon's violence and\r\nbluster when speaking.\r\n\r\n[6] A musician, belonging to Phrygia, who had composed melodies intended\r\nto describe pain.\r\n\r\n[7] Line 323 of the 'Hyppolytus,' by Euripides.\r\n\r\n[8] Euripides' mother was said to have sold vegetables on the market.\r\n\r\n[9] The whole of this passage seems a satire on the want of courage shown\r\nby these two generals. History, however, speaks of Nicias as a brave\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n[10] i.e. living on his salary as a judge. The Athenians used beans for\r\nrecording their votes.\r\n\r\n[11] Place where the Public Assembly of Athens, the [Greek: ekkl_esia],\r\nwas held.\r\n\r\n[12] This was the salary paid to the Ecclesiasts, the jury of citizens\r\nwho tried cases. It was one obol at first, but Cleon had raised it to\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n[13] A town in Messina, opposite the little island of Sphacteria;\r\nDemosthenes had seized it, and the Spartans had vainly tried to retake\r\nit, having even been obliged to leave four hundred soldiers shut up in\r\nSphacteria. Cleon, sent out with additional forces, had forced the\r\nSpartans to capitulate and had thus robbed Demosthenes of the glory of\r\nthe capture. (_See_ Introduction.)\r\n\r\n[14] Literally, his rump is among the Chaonians ([Greek: chain_o], to\r\ngape open), because his anus is distended by pederastic practices; his\r\nhands with the Aetolians ([Greek: aite_o], to ask, to beg); his mind with\r\nthe Clopidians ([Greek: klept_o], to steal).\r\n\r\n[15] The versions of his death vary. He is said to have taken poison in\r\norder to avoid fighting against Athens.\r\n\r\n[16] A minor god, supposed by the ancients to preside over the life of\r\neach man; each empire, each province, each town had its titular Genius.\r\nEveryone offered sacrifice to his Genius on each anniversary of his birth\r\nwith wine, flowers and incense.\r\n\r\n[17] A hill in Asia Minor, near Smyrna. Homer mentions the wine of\r\nPramnium.\r\n\r\n[18] The common people, who at Athens were as superstitious as everywhere\r\nelse, took delight in oracles, especially when they were favourable, and\r\nCleon served them up to suit their taste and to advance his own ambition.\r\n\r\n[19] Famous seer of Boeotia.\r\n\r\n[20] Eucrates, who was the leading statesman at Athens after Pericles.\r\n\r\n[21] Lysicles, who married the courtesan Aspasia.\r\n\r\n[22] Literally, like Cycloborus, a torrent in Attica.\r\n\r\n[23] He points to the spectators.\r\n\r\n[24] The public meals were given in the Prytaneum; to these were admitted\r\nthose whose services merited that they should be fed at the cost of the\r\nState. This distinction depended on the popular vote, and was very often\r\nbestowed on demagogues very unworthy of the privilege.\r\n\r\n[25] Islands of the Aegaean, subject to Athens, which paid considerable\r\ntributes.\r\n\r\n[26] Caria and Chalcedon were at the two extremities of Asia Minor; the\r\nformer being at the southern, the latter at the northern end of that\r\nextensive coast.\r\n\r\n[27] As though stupidity were an essential of good government.\r\n\r\n[28] The Athenian citizens were divided into four classes--the\r\nPentacosiomedimni, who possessed five hundred minae; the Knights, who had\r\nthree hundred and were obliged to maintain a charger (hence their name);\r\nthe Zeugitae and the Thetes. In Athens, the Knights never had the high\r\nconsideration and the share in the magistracy which they enjoyed at Rome.\r\n\r\n[29] It is said that Aristophanes played the part of Cleon himself, as no\r\none dared to assume the role. (_See_ Introduction.)\r\n\r\n[30] They were two leaders of the knightly order.\r\n\r\n[31] The famous whirlpool, near Sicily.\r\n\r\n[32] Eucrates, the oakum-seller, already mentioned, when the object of a\r\nriot, took refuge in a mill and there hid himself in a sack of bran.\r\n\r\n[33] The chief Athenian tribunal only next in dignity to the Areopagus;\r\nit generally consisted of two hundred members; it tried civil cases of\r\nthe greatest importance and some crimes beyond the competence of other\r\ncourts, e.g. rape, adultery, extortion. The sittings were in the open\r\nair, hence the name ([Greek: _Elios], the sun).\r\n\r\n[34] The Heliasts' salary. (_See_ above.)\r\n\r\n[35] Tributary to Athens; Olynthus and Potidaea were the chief towns of\r\nthis important Peninsula.\r\n\r\n[36] Meaning he frightens him with the menace of judicial prosecution\r\nforces him to purchase silence.\r\n\r\n[37] The strategi were the heads of the military forces.\r\n\r\n[38] They presided at the Public Assemblies; they were also empowered to\r\ntry the most important cases.\r\n\r\n[39] An allusion to Cleon's former calling.\r\n\r\n[40] A country deme of Attica.\r\n\r\n[41] Archeptolemus, a resident alien, who lived in Piraeus. He had loaded\r\nAthens with gifts and was nevertheless maltreated by Cleon.\r\n\r\n[42] This was easier than against a citizen because of the inferiority,\r\nin which the pride of the Athenian held those born on other soil.\r\n\r\n[43] When drunk he conceives himself rich and the man to buy up the rich\r\nsilver mines of Laurium, in south-east Attica.\r\n\r\n[44] The Chorus throws itself between Cleon and Agoracritus to protect\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n[45] An iron collar, an instrument of torture and of punishment.\r\n\r\n[46] A disease among swine.\r\n\r\n[47] Cleon wanted the Spartans to purchase the prisoners of Sphacteria\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n[48] With piss--the result of his drunken habits.\r\n\r\n[49] A tragic poet, apparently proverbial for feebleness of style.\r\n\r\n[50] Beginning of a song of Simonides.\r\n\r\n[51] A miser.\r\n\r\n[52] Guests used pieces of bread to wipe their fingers at table.\r\n\r\n[53] 'Dog's head,' a vicious species of ape.\r\n\r\n[54] They were allowed to remain in the ground throughout the winter so\r\nthat they might grow tender.\r\n\r\n[55] An allusion to the pederastic habits ascribed to some of the orators\r\nby popular rumour.\r\n\r\n[56] He imputes the crime to Agoracritus of which he is guilty himself.\r\n\r\n[57] A town in Thrace and subject to Athens. It therefore paid tribute to\r\nthe latter. It often happened that the demagogues extracted considerable\r\nsums from the tributaries by threats or promises.\r\n\r\n[58] It was customary in Athens for the plaintiff himself to fix the fine\r\nto be paid by the defendant.\r\n\r\n[59] Athené, the tutelary divinity of Athens.\r\n\r\n[60] And wife of Pisistratus. Anything belonging to the ancient tyrants\r\nwas hateful to the Athenians.\r\n\r\n[61] An allusion to the language used by the democratic orators, who, to\r\nbe better understood by the people, constantly affected the use of terms\r\nbelonging to the different trades.\r\n\r\n[62] He accuses Cleon of collusion with the enemy.\r\n\r\n[63] Cleon retorts upon his adversary the charge brought against himself.\r\nThe Boeotians were the allies of Sparta.\r\n\r\n[64] Allusion to cock-fighting.\r\n\r\n[65] The tripping metre usually employed in the _parabasis_.\r\n\r\n[66] Hitherto Aristophanes had presented his pieces under an assumed\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[67] A comic poet, who had carried off the prize eleven times; not a\r\nfragment of his works remains to us.\r\n\r\n[68] An allusion to the titles of some of his pieces, viz. \"the Flute\r\nPlayers, the Birds, the Lydians, the Gnats, the Frogs.\"\r\n\r\n[69] The Comic Poet, rival of Aristophanes, several times referred to\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[70] These were the opening lines of poems by Cratinus, often sung at\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\n[71] A poet, successful at the Olympic games, and in old age reduced to\r\nextreme misery.\r\n\r\n[72] The place of honour in the Dionysiac Theatre, reserved for\r\ndistinguished citizens.\r\n\r\n[73] A Comic Poet, who was elegant but cold; he had at first played as an\r\nactor in the pieces of Cratinus.\r\n\r\n[74] Besides the oarsmen and the pilot, there was on the Grecian vessels\r\na sailor, who stood at the prow to look out for rocks, and another, who\r\nobserved the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n[75] Two promontories, one in Attica, the other in Euboea, on which\r\ntemples to Posidon were erected.\r\n\r\n[76] An Athenian general, who had gained several naval victories. He had\r\ncontributed to the success of the expedition to Samos (Thucydides, Book\r\nI), and had recently beaten a Peloponnesian fleet (Thucydides, Book II).\r\n\r\n[77] At the Panathenaea, a festival held every fourth year, a peplus, or\r\nsail, was carried with pomp to the Acropolis. On this various\r\nmythological scenes, having reference to Athené, were embroidered--her\r\nexploits against the giants, her fight with Posidon concerning the name\r\nto be given to Athens, etc. It had also become customary to add the names\r\nand the deeds of such citizens as had deserved well of their country.\r\n\r\n[78] Cleaenetus had passed a law to limit the number of citizens to be\r\nfed at the Prytaneum; it may be supposed, that those, who aspired to this\r\ndistinction, sought to conciliate Cleaenetus in their favour.\r\n\r\n[79] The Chorus of Knights, not being able to sing their own praises,\r\nfeign to divert these to their chargers.\r\n\r\n[80] A horse branded with the obsolete letter [Greek: sán]--[Symbol:\r\nLetter 'san'], as a mark of breed or high quality.\r\n\r\n[81] Crab was no doubt a nickname given to the Corinthians on account of\r\nthe position of their city on an isthmus between two seas. In the\r\n'Acharnians' Theorus is mentioned as an ambassador, who had returned from\r\nthe King of Persia.\r\n\r\n[82] The Senate was a body composed of five hundred members, elected\r\nannually like the magistrates from the three first classes to the\r\nexclusion of the fourth, the Thetes, which was composed of the poorest\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n[83] The [Greek: moth_on], a rough, boisterous, obscene dance.\r\n\r\n[84] At the festival of the Pyanepsia, held in honour of Athené as the\r\nprotectress of Theseus in his fight with the Minotaur, the children\r\ncarried olive branches in procession, round which strips of linen were\r\nwound; they were then fastened up over the entrances of each house.\r\n\r\n[85] On which the citizens sat in the Public Assembly in the Pnyx to hear\r\nthe orators. In the centre of the semicircular space the tribune stood, a\r\nsquare block of stone, [Greek: B_ema], and from this the people were\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n[86] Lysicles was a dealer in sheep, who had wielded great power in\r\nAthens after the death of Pericles. Cynna and Salabaccha were two\r\ncelebrated courtesans.\r\n\r\n[87] Place of interment for those who died for the country.\r\n\r\n[88] Seated on the banks for the rowers.\r\n\r\n[89] Assassin of the tyrant Hippias, the son of Pisistratus. His memory\r\nwas held in great honour at Athens.\r\n\r\n[90] Driven out by the invasions of the Peloponnesians, the people of the\r\noutlying districts had been obliged to seek refuge within the walls of\r\nAthens, where they were lodged wherever they could find room.\r\n\r\n[91] A verse borrowed from Euripides' lost play of 'Telephus.'\r\n\r\n[92] Themistocles joined the Piraeus to Athens by the construction of the\r\nLong Walls.\r\n\r\n[93] Which were caught off the Piraeus.\r\n\r\n[94] Mitylené, chief city of the Island of Lesbos, rebelled against the\r\nAthenians and was retaken by Chares. By a popular decree the whole\r\nmanhood of the town was to suffer death, but this decree was withdrawn\r\nthe next day. Aristophanes insinuates that Cleon, bought over with\r\nMitylenaean gold, brought about this change of opinion. On the contrary,\r\nThucydides says that the decree was revoked in spite of Cleon's\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n[95] When bucklers were hung up as trophies, it was usual to detach the\r\nring or brace, so as to render them useless for warlike purposes.\r\n\r\n[96] An orator of debauched habits.\r\n\r\n[97] An accusation frequently hurled at the orators.\r\n\r\n[98] Guests took off their shoes before entering the festal hall.\r\n\r\n[99] An allusion to Cleon's former calling of a tanner.\r\n\r\n[100] A plant from Cyrenaïca, which was imported into Athens in large\r\nquantities after the conclusion of a treaty of navigation, which Cleon\r\nmade with this country. It was a very highly valued flavouring for\r\nsauces.\r\n\r\n[101] The name of a supposed informer. The adjective, [Greek: pyrrhos],\r\nyellow, the colour of ordure, is contained in the construction of this\r\nname; thus a most disgusting piece of word-play is intended.\r\n\r\n[102] The orators were for ever claiming the protection of Athené.\r\n\r\n[103] A very expensive burden, which was imposed upon the rich citizen.\r\nThe trierarchs had to furnish both the equipment of the triremes or\r\nwar-galleys and their upkeep. They varied considerably in number and\r\nended in reaching a total of 1200; the most opulent found the money, and\r\nwere later repaid partly and little by little by those not so well\r\ncircumstanced. Later it was permissible for anyone, appointed as a\r\ntrierarch, to point out someone richer than himself and to ask to have\r\nhim take his place with the condition that if the other preferred, he\r\nshould exchange fortunes with him and continue his office of trierarch.\r\n\r\n[104] This is an allusion to some extortion of Cleon's.\r\n\r\n[105] The Greek word [Greek: d_emos] means both \"The People\" and fat,\r\ngrease. The pun cannot well be kept in English.\r\n\r\n[106] A voracious bird--in allusion to Cleon's rapacity and to his\r\nloquacity in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n[107] The orators were fond of supporting their arguments with imaginary\r\noracles--and Cleon was an especial adept at this dodge.\r\n\r\n[108] Smicythes, King of Thrace, spoken of in the oracle as a woman,\r\ndoubtless on account of his cowardice. The word pursue is here used in a\r\ndouble sense, viz. in battle and in law. It is on account of this latter\r\nmeaning, that Aristophanes adds \"and her spouse,\" because in cases in\r\nwhich women were sued at law, their husbands were summoned as conjointly\r\nliable.\r\n\r\n[109] Because he had smashed up and turned upside down the fortunes of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n[110] The pun--rather a far-fetched one--is between the words [Greek:\r\nD_orh_osti] (in the Dorian mode) and [Greek: d_orhon] (a bribe).\r\n\r\n[111] A Boeotian soothsayer.\r\n\r\n[112] A name invented by the Sausage-seller on the spur of the moment, to\r\ncap Cleon's boast.\r\n\r\n[113] That is, Athenian; Erectheus was an ancient mythical King of\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\n[114] That is, the tributes paid to Athens by the Aegaean Islands,\r\nwhether allies or subjects.\r\n\r\n[115] The Lacedaemonian prisoners from Sphacteria, so often referred to.\r\n\r\n[116] That is, Athenian; Cecrops was the first King of Athens, according\r\nto the legends.\r\n\r\n[117] There were three towns of this name in different parts of Greece.\r\n\r\n[118] There is a pun here which it is impossible to render in English;\r\nthe Greek [Greek: Pylos](Pylos) differs by only one letter from the word\r\nmeaning a bath-tub ([Greek: Pyelos]).\r\n\r\n[119] Cleon was reproached by his enemies with paying small attention to\r\nthe regular payment of the sailors.\r\n\r\n[120] Another poetical term to signify Athenian; Aegeus, an ancient\r\nmythical King of Athens, father of Theseus.\r\n\r\n[121] Impudent as a dog and cunning as a fox.\r\n\r\n[122] An orator and statesman of the day; practically nothing is known\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n[123] Another orator and statesman, accused apparently of taking bribes.\r\n\r\n[124] As pointed out before, the orators were fond of dragging Athené\r\ncontinually into their speeches.\r\n\r\n[125] One of Cleon's protégés and flatterers. The scholiasts say he was\r\nhis secretary.\r\n\r\n[126] Terms borrowed from the circus races.\r\n\r\n[127] That is, at the expense of other folk.\r\n\r\n[128] Pieces of bread, hollowed out, which were filled with mincemeat or\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\n[129] Both Greeks and Romans drank their wine mixed with water.\r\n\r\n[130] After his success in the Sphacteria affair Cleon induced the people\r\nto vote him a chaplet of gold.\r\n\r\n[131] That is, by means of the mechanical device of the Greek stage known\r\nas the [Greek: ekkukl_ema].\r\n\r\n[132] Parody of a well-known verse from Euripides' 'Alcestis.'\r\n\r\n[133] The name Agoracritus is compounded: cf. [Greek: agora], a\r\nmarket-place, and [Greek: krinein], to judge.\r\n\r\n[134] This grandiloquent opening is borrowed from Pindar.\r\n\r\n[135] Mentioned in the 'Acharnians.'\r\n\r\n[136] A soothsayer.\r\n\r\n[137] A flute-player.\r\n\r\n[138] An allusion to the vice of the 'cunnilingue,' apparently a novel\r\nform of naughtiness at Athens in Aristophanes' day.\r\n\r\n[139] As well known for his gluttony as for his cowardice.\r\n\r\n[140] One of the most noisy demagogues of Cleon's party; he succeeded\r\nhim, but was later condemned to ostracism.\r\n\r\n[141] A town in Bithynia, situated at the entrance of the Bosphorus and\r\nnearly opposite Byzantium. It was one of the most important towns in Asia\r\nMinor. Doubtless Hyperbolus only demanded so large a fleet to terrorize\r\nthe towns and oppress them at will.\r\n\r\n[142] These temples were inviolable places of refuge, where even slaves\r\nwere secure.\r\n\r\n[143] A rocky cleft at the back of the Acropolis into which criminals\r\nwere hurled.\r\n\r\n[144] Young and effeminate orators of licentious habits.\r\n\r\n[145] By adroit special pleading he had contrived to get his acquittal,\r\nwhen charged with a capital offence.\r\n\r\n[146] They were personified on the stage as pretty little _filles de\r\njoie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACHARNIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the series of three Comedies--'The Acharnians,'\r\n'Peace' and 'Lysistrata'--produced at intervals of years, the sixth,\r\ntenth and twenty-first of the Peloponnesian War, and impressing on the\r\nAthenian people the miseries and disasters due to it and to the\r\nscoundrels who by their selfish and reckless policy had provoked it, the\r\nconsequent ruin of industry and, above all, agriculture, and the urgency\r\nof asking Peace. In date it is the earliest play brought out by the\r\nauthor in his own name and his first work of serious importance. It was\r\nacted at the Lenaean Festival, in January, 426 B.C., and gained the first\r\nprize, Cratinus being second.\r\n\r\nIts diatribes against the War and fierce criticism of the general policy\r\nof the War party so enraged Cleon that, as already mentioned, he\r\nendeavoured to ruin the author, who in 'The Knights' retorted by a direct\r\nand savage personal attack on the leader of the democracy. The plot is of\r\nthe simplest. Dicaeopolis, an Athenian citizen, but a native of Acharnae,\r\none of the agricultural _demes_ and one which had especially suffered in\r\nthe Lacedaemonian invasions, sick and tired of the ill-success and\r\nmiseries of the War, makes up his mind, if he fails to induce the people\r\nto adopt his policy of \"peace at any price,\" to conclude a private and\r\nparticular peace of his own to cover himself, his family, and his estate.\r\nThe Athenians, momentarily elated by victory and over-persuaded by the\r\ndemagogues of the day--Cleon and his henchmen, refuse to hear of such a\r\nthing as coming to terms. Accordingly Dicaeopolis dispatches an envoy to\r\nSparta on his own account, who comes back presently with a selection of\r\nspecimen treaties in his pocket. The old man tastes and tries, special\r\nterms are arranged, and the play concludes with a riotous and uproarious\r\nrustic feast in honour of the blessings of Peace and Plenty. Incidentally\r\nexcellent fun is poked at Euripides and his dramatic methods, which\r\nsupply matter for so much witty badinage in several others of our\r\nauthor's pieces.\r\n\r\nOther specially comic incidents are: the scene where the two young\r\ndaughters of the famished Megarian are sold in the market at Athens as\r\nsucking-pigs--a scene in which the convenient similarity of the Greek\r\nwords signifying a pig and the 'pudendum muliebre' respectively is\r\nutilized in a whole string of ingenious and suggestive 'double entendres'\r\nand ludicrous jokes; another where the Informer, or Market-Spy, is packed\r\nup in a crate as crockery and carried off home by the Boeotian buyer.\r\n\r\nThe drama takes its title from the Chorus, composed of old men of\r\nAcharnae.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ACHARNIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS.\r\nHERALD.\r\nAMPHITHEUS.\r\nAMBASSADORS.\r\nPSEUDARTABAS.\r\nTHEORUS.\r\nWIFE OF DICAEOPOLIS.\r\nDAUGHTER OF DICAEOPOLIS.\r\nEURIPIDES.\r\nCEPHISOPHON, servant of Euripides.\r\nLAMACHUS.\r\nATTENDANT OF LAMACHUS.\r\nA MEGARIAN.\r\nMAIDENS, daughters of the Megarian.\r\nA BOEOTIAN.\r\nNICARCHUS.\r\nA HUSBANDMAN.\r\nA BRIDESMAID.\r\nAN INFORMER.\r\nMESSENGERS.\r\nCHORUS OF ACHARNIAN ELDERS.\r\n\r\nSCENE: The Athenian Ecclesia on the Pnyx; afterwards Dicaeopolis' house\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ACHARNIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS[147] (_alone_). What cares have not gnawed at my heart and\r\nhow few have been the pleasures in my life! Four, to be exact, while my\r\ntroubles have been as countless as the grains of sand on the shore! Let\r\nme see of what value to me have been these few pleasures? Ah! I remember\r\nthat I was delighted in soul when Cleon had to disgorge those five\r\ntalents;[148] I was in ecstasy and I love the Knights for this deed; 'it\r\nis an honour to Greece.'[149] But the day when I was impatiently awaiting\r\na piece by Aeschylus,[150] what tragic despair it caused me when the\r\nherald called, \"Theognis,[151] introduce your Chorus!\" Just imagine how\r\nthis blow struck straight at my heart! On the other hand, what joy\r\nDexitheus caused me at the musical competition, when he played a Boeotian\r\nmelody on the lyre! But this year by contrast! Oh! what deadly torture to\r\nhear Chaeris[152] perform the prelude in the Orthian mode![153]--Never,\r\nhowever, since I began to bathe, has the dust hurt my eyes as it does\r\nto-day. Still it is the day of assembly; all should be here at daybreak,\r\nand yet the Pnyx[154] is still deserted. They are gossiping in the\r\nmarket-place, slipping hither and thither to avoid the vermilioned\r\nrope.[155] The Prytanes[156] even do not come; they will be late, but\r\nwhen they come they will push and fight each other for a seat in the\r\nfront row. They will never trouble themselves with the question of peace.\r\nOh! Athens! Athens! As for myself, I do not fail to come here before all\r\nthe rest, and now, finding myself alone, I groan, yawn, stretch, break\r\nwind, and know not what to do; I make sketches in the dust, pull out my\r\nloose hairs, muse, think of my fields, long for peace, curse town life\r\nand regret my dear country home,[157] which never told me to 'buy fuel,\r\nvinegar or oil'; there the word 'buy,' which cuts me in two, was unknown;\r\nI harvested everything at will. Therefore I have come to the assembly\r\nfully prepared to bawl, interrupt and abuse the speakers, if they talk of\r\naught but peace. But here come the Prytanes, and high time too, for it is\r\nmidday! As I foretold, hah! is it not so? They are pushing and fighting\r\nfor the front seats.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Move on up, move on, move on, to get within the consecrated\r\narea.[158]\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Has anyone spoken yet?\r\n\r\nHERALD. Who asks to speak?\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. I do.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Your name?\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Amphitheus.\r\n\r\nHERALD. You are no man.[159]\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. No! I am an immortal! Amphitheus was the son of Ceres and\r\nTriptolemus; of him was born Celeus. Celeus wedded Phaencreté, my\r\ngrandmother, whose son was Lucinus, and, being born of him, I am an\r\nimmortal; it is to me alone that the gods have entrusted the duty of\r\ntreating with the Lacedaemonians. But, citizens, though I am immortal, I\r\nam dying of hunger; the Prytanes give me naught.[160]\r\n\r\nA PRYTANIS. Guards!\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Oh, Triptolemus and Ceres, do ye thus forsake your own blood?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Prytanes, in expelling this citizen, you are offering an\r\noutrage to the Assembly. He only desired to secure peace for us and to\r\nsheathe the sword.\r\n\r\nPRYTANIS. Sit down and keep silence!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, by Apollo, will I not, unless you are going to discuss\r\nthe question of peace.\r\n\r\nHERALD. The ambassadors, who are returned from the Court of the King!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Of what King? I am sick of all those fine birds, the peacock\r\nambassadors and their swagger.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Silence!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! oh! by Ecbatana,[161] what assumption!\r\n\r\nAN AMBASSADOR. During the archonship of Euthymenes, you sent us to the\r\nGreat King on a salary of two drachmae per diem.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! those poor drachmae!\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. We suffered horribly on the plains of the Caÿster, sleeping\r\nunder a tent, stretched deliciously on fine chariots, half dead with\r\nweariness.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And I was very much at ease, lying on the straw along the\r\nbattlements![162]\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. Everywhere we were well received and forced to drink\r\ndelicious wine out of golden or crystal flagons....\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, city of Cranaus,[163] thy ambassadors are laughing at\r\nthee!\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. For great feeders and heavy drinkers are alone esteemed as\r\nmen by the barbarians.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Just as here in Athens, we only esteem the most drunken\r\ndebauchees.\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. At the end of the fourth year we reached the King's Court,\r\nbut he had left with his whole army to ease himself, and for the space of\r\neight months he was thus easing himself in midst of the golden\r\nmountains.[164]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And how long was he replacing his dress?\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. The whole period of a full moon; after which he returned to\r\nhis palace; then he entertained us and had us served with oxen roasted\r\nwhole in an oven.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who ever saw an oxen baked in an oven? What a lie!\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. On my honour, he also had us served with a bird three times\r\nas large as Cleonymus,[165] and called the Boaster.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And do we give you two drachmae, that you should treat us to\r\nall this humbug?\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. We are bringing to you, Pseudartabas,[166] the King's Eye.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I would a crow might pluck out thine with his beak, thou\r\ncursed ambassador!\r\n\r\nHERALD. The King's Eye!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Eh! Great gods! Friend, with thy great eye, round like the\r\nhole through which the oarsman passes his sweep, you have the air of a\r\ngalley doubling a cape to gain the port.\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. Come, Pseudartabas, give forth the message for the Athenians\r\nwith which you were charged by the Great King.\r\n\r\nPSEUDARTABAS. Jartaman exarx 'anapissonnai satra.[167]\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. Do you understand what he says?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. By Apollo, not I!\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. He says, that the Great King will send you gold. Come, utter\r\nthe word 'gold' louder and more distinctly.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Thou shalt not have gold, thou gaping-arsed Ionian.[168]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! may the gods forgive me, but that is clear enough.\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. What does he say?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. That the Ionians are debauchees and idiots, if they expect\r\nto receive gold from the barbarians.\r\n\r\nAMBASSADOR. Not so, he speaks of medimni[169] of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What medimni? Thou art but a great braggart; but get your\r\nway, I will find out the truth by myself. Come now, answer me clearly, if\r\nyou do not wish me to dye your skin red. Will the Great King send us\r\ngold? (_Pseudartabas makes a negative sign._) Then our ambassadors are\r\nseeking to deceive us? (_Pseudartabas signs affirmatively._) These\r\nfellows make signs like any Greek; I am sure that they are nothing but\r\nAthenians. Oh, ho! I recognize one of these eunuchs; it is Clisthenes,\r\nthe son of Sibyrtius.[170] Behold the effrontery of this shaven rump!\r\nHow! great baboon, with such a beard do you seek to play the eunuch to\r\nus? And this other one? Is it not Straton?\r\n\r\nHERALD. Silence! Let all be seated. The Senate invites the King's Eye to\r\nthe Prytaneum.[171]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is this not sufficient to drive one to hang oneself? Here I\r\nstand chilled to the bone, whilst the doors of the Prytaneum fly wide\r\nopen to lodge such rascals. But I will do something great and bold. Where\r\nis Amphitheus? Come and speak with me.\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Here I am.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take these eight drachmae and go and conclude a truce with\r\nthe Lacedaemonians for me, my wife and my children; I leave you free, my\r\ndear citizens, to send out embassies and to stand gaping in the air.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Bring in Theorus, who has returned from the Court of\r\nSitalces.[172]\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. I am here.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Another humbug!\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. We should not have remained long in Thrace....\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Forsooth, no, if you had not been well paid.\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. ... If the country had not been covered with snow; the rivers\r\nwere ice-bound at the time that Theognis[173] brought out his tragedy\r\nhere; during the whole of that time I was holding my own with Sitalces,\r\ncup in hand; and, in truth, he adored you to such a degree, that he wrote\r\non the walls, \"How beautiful are the Athenians!\" His son, to whom we gave\r\nthe freedom of the city, burned with desire to come here and eat\r\nchitterlings at the feast of the Apaturia;[174] he prayed his father to\r\ncome to the aid of his new country and Sitalces swore on his goblet that\r\nhe would succour us with such a host that the Athenians would exclaim,\r\n\"What a cloud of grasshoppers!\"\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. May I die if I believe a word of what you tell us! Excepting\r\nthe grasshoppers, there is not a grain of truth in it all!\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. And he has sent you the most warlike soldiers of all Thrace.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Now we shall begin to see clearly.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Come hither, Thracians, whom Theorus brought.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What plague have we here?\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. 'Tis the host of the Odomanti.[175]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Of the Odomanti? Tell me what it means. Who has mutilated\r\ntheir tools like this?\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. If they are given a wage of two drachmae, they will put all\r\nBoeotia[176] to fire and sword.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Two drachmae to those circumcised hounds! Groan aloud, ye\r\npeople of rowers, bulwark of Athens! Ah! great gods! I am undone; these\r\nOdomanti are robbing me of my garlic![177] Will you give me back my\r\ngarlic?\r\n\r\nTHEORUS. Oh! wretched man! do not go near them; they have eaten\r\ngarlic.[178]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Prytanes, will you let me be treated in this manner, in my\r\nown country and by barbarians? But I oppose the discussion of paying a\r\nwage to the Thracians; I announce an omen; I have just felt a drop of\r\nrain.[179]\r\n\r\nHERALD. Let the Thracians withdraw and return the day after to-morrow;\r\nthe Prytanes declare the sitting at an end.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ye gods, what garlic I have lost! But here comes Amphitheus\r\nreturned from Lacedaemon. Welcome, Amphitheus.\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. No, there is no welcome for me and I fly as fast as I can,\r\nfor I am pursued by the Acharnians.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Why, what has happened?\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. I was hurrying to bring your treaty of truce, but some old\r\ndotards from Acharnae[180] got scent of the thing; they are veterans of\r\nMarathon, tough as oak or maple, of which they are made for sure--rough\r\nand ruthless. They all set to a-crying, \"Wretch! you are the bearer of a\r\ntreaty, and the enemy has only just cut our vines!\" Meanwhile they were\r\ngathering stones in their cloaks, so I fled and they ran after me\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Let 'em shout as much as they please! But have you brought\r\nme a treaty?\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Most certainly, here are three samples to select from,[181]\r\nthis one is five years old; take it and taste.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Faugh!\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Well?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. It does not please me; it smells of pitch and of the ships\r\nthey are fitting out.[182]\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. Here is another, ten years old; taste it.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. It smells strongly of the delegates, who go round the towns\r\nto chide the allies for their slowness.[183]\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. This last is a truce of thirty years, both on sea and land.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! by Bacchus! what a bouquet! It has the aroma of nectar\r\nand ambrosia; this does not say to us, \"Provision yourselves for three\r\ndays.\" But it lisps the gentle numbers, \"Go whither you will.\"[184] I\r\naccept it, ratify it, drink it at one draught and consign the Acharnians\r\nto limbo. Freed from the war and its ills, I shall keep the Dionysia[185]\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nAMPHITHEUS. And I shall run away, for I'm mortally afraid of the\r\nAcharnians.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This way all! Let us follow our man; we will demand him of\r\neveryone we meet; the public weal makes his seizure imperative. Ho,\r\nthere! tell me which way the bearer of the truce has gone; he has escaped\r\nus, he has disappeared. Curse old age! When I was young, in the days when\r\nI followed Phayllus,[186] running with a sack of coals on my back, this\r\nwretch would not have eluded my pursuit, let him be as swift as he will;\r\nbut now my limbs are stiff; old Lacratides[187] feels his legs are\r\nweighty and the traitor escapes me. No, no, let us follow him; old\r\nAcharnians like ourselves shall not be set at naught by a scoundrel, who\r\nhas dared, great gods! to conclude a truce, when I wanted the war\r\ncontinued with double fury in order to avenge my ruined lands. No mercy\r\nfor our foes until I have pierced their hearts like a sharp reed, so that\r\nthey dare never again ravage my vineyards. Come, let us seek the rascal;\r\nlet us look everywhere, carrying our stones in our hands; let us hunt him\r\nfrom place to place until we trap him; I could never, never tire of the\r\ndelight of stoning him.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Peace! profane men![188]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Silence all! Friends, do you hear the sacred formula? Here is he,\r\nwhom we seek! This way, all! Get out of his way, surely he comes to offer\r\nan oblation.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Peace, profane men! Let the basket-bearer[189] come forward,\r\nand thou, Xanthias, hold the phallus well upright.[190]\r\n\r\nWIFE OF DICAEOPOLIS. Daughter, set down the basket and let us begin the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER OF DICAEOPOLIS. Mother, hand me the ladle, that I may spread the\r\nsauce on the cake.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. It is well! Oh, mighty Bacchus, it is with joy that, freed\r\nfrom military duty, I and all mine perform this solemn rite and offer\r\nthee this sacrifice; grant, that I may keep the rural Dionysia without\r\nhindrance and that this truce of thirty years may be propitious for me.\r\n\r\nWIFE OF DICAEOPOLIS. Come, my child, carry the basket gracefully and with\r\na grave, demure face. Happy he, who shall be your possessor and embrace\r\nyou so firmly at dawn,[191] that you belch wind like a weasel. Go\r\nforward, and have a care they don't snatch your jewels in the crowd.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Xanthias, walk behind the basket-bearer and hold the phallus\r\nwell erect; I will follow, singing the Phallic hymn; thou, wife, look on\r\nfrom the top of the terrace.[192] Forward! Oh, Phales,[193] companion of\r\nthe orgies of Bacchus, night reveller, god of adultery, friend of young\r\nmen, these past six[194] years I have not been able to invoke thee. With\r\nwhat joy I return to my farmstead, thanks to the truce I have concluded,\r\nfreed from cares, from fighting and from Lamachuses![195] How much\r\nsweeter, Phales, oh, Phales, is it to surprise Thratta, the pretty\r\nwood-maid, Strymodorus' slave, stealing wood from Mount Phelleus, to\r\ncatch her under the arms, to throw her on the ground and possess her! Oh,\r\nPhales, Phales! If thou wilt drink and bemuse thyself with me, we will\r\nto-morrow consume some good dish in honour of the peace, and I will hang\r\nup my buckler over the smoking hearth.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. It is he, he himself. Stone him, stone him, stone him, strike the\r\nwretch. All, all of you, pelt him, pelt him!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What is this? By Heracles, you will smash my pot.[196]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. It is you that we are stoning, you miserable scoundrel.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And for what sin, Acharnian Elders, tell me that!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You ask that, you impudent rascal, traitor to your country; you\r\nalone amongst us all have concluded a truce, and you dare to look us in\r\nthe face!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But you do not know _why_ I have treated for peace. Listen!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Listen to you? No, no, you are about to die, we will annihilate\r\nyou with our stones.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But first of all, listen. Stop, my friends.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. I will hear nothing; do not address me; I hate you more than I do\r\nCleon,[197] whom one day I shall flay to make sandals for the Knights.\r\nListen to your long speeches, after you have treated with the Laconians!\r\nNo, I will punish you.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Friends, leave the Laconians out of debate and consider only\r\nwhether I have not done well to conclude my truce.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Done well! when you have treated with a people who know neither\r\ngods, nor truth, nor faith.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. We attribute too much to the Laconians; as for myself, I\r\nknow that they are not the cause of all our troubles.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh, indeed, rascal! You dare to use such language to me and then\r\nexpect me to spare you!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, they are not the cause of all our troubles, and I\r\nwho address you claim to be able to prove that they have much to complain\r\nof in us.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This passes endurance; my heart bounds with fury. Thus you dare\r\nto defend our enemies.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Were my head on the block I would uphold what I say and rely\r\non the approval of the people.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Comrades, let us hurl our stones and dye this fellow purple.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What black fire-brand has inflamed your heart! You will not\r\nhear me? You really will not, Acharnians?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. No, a thousand times, no.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is a hateful injustice.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. May I die, if I listen.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Nay, nay! have mercy, have mercy, Acharnians.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You shall die.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, blood for blood! I will kill your dearest friend. I\r\nhave here the hostages of Acharnae;[198] I shall disembowel them.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Acharnians, what means this threat? Has he got one of our\r\nchildren in his house? What gives him such audacity?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Stone me, if it please you; I shall avenge myself on this.\r\n(_Shows a basket_.) Let us see whether you have any love for your coals.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Great gods! this basket is our fellow-citizen. Stop, stop, in\r\nheaven's name!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall dismember it despite your cries; I will listen to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. How! will you kill this coal-basket, my beloved comrade?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Just now, you did not listen to me.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well, speak now, if you will; tell us, tell us you have a\r\nweakness for the Lacedaemonians. I consent to anything; never will I\r\nforsake this dear little basket.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. First, throw down your stones.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. There! 'tis done. And you, do you put away your sword.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Let me see that no stones remain concealed in your cloaks.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. They are all on the ground; see how we shake our garments. Come,\r\nno haggling, lay down your sword; we threw away everything while crossing\r\nfrom one side of the stage to the other.[199]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What cries of anguish you would have uttered had these coals\r\nof Parnes[200] been dismembered, and yet it came very near it; had they\r\nperished, their death would have been due to the folly of their\r\nfellow-citizens. The poor basket was so frightened, look, it has shed a\r\nthick black dust over me, the same as a cuttle-fish does. What an\r\nirritable temper! You shout and throw stones, you will not hear my\r\narguments--not even when I propose to speak in favour of the\r\nLacedaemonians with my head on the block; and yet I cling to my life.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well then, bring out a block before your door, scoundrel, and let\r\nus hear the good grounds you can give us; I am curious to know them. Now\r\nmind, as you proposed yourself, place your head on the block and speak.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Here is the block; and, though I am but a very sorry\r\nspeaker, I wish nevertheless to talk freely of the Lacedaemonians and\r\nwithout the protection of my buckler. Yet I have many reasons for fear. I\r\nknow our rustics; they are delighted if some braggart comes, and rightly\r\nor wrongly loads both them and their city with praise and flattery; they\r\ndo not see that such toad-eaters[201] are traitors, who sell them for\r\ngain. As for the old men, I know their weakness; they only seek to\r\noverwhelm the accused with their votes.[202] Nor have I forgotten how\r\nCleon treated me because of my comedy last year;[203] he dragged me\r\nbefore the Senate and there he uttered endless slanders against me; 'twas\r\na tempest of abuse, a deluge of lies. Through what a slough of mud he\r\ndragged me! I nigh perished. Permit me, therefore, before I speak, to\r\ndress in the manner most likely to draw pity.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What evasions, subterfuges and delays! Hold! here is the sombre\r\nhelmet of Pluto with its thick bristling plume; Hieronymus[204] lends it\r\nto you; then open Sisyphus'[205] bag of wiles; but hurry, hurry, pray,\r\nfor our discussion does not admit of delay.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. The time has come for me to manifest my courage, so I will\r\ngo and seek Euripides. Ho! slave, slave!\r\n\r\nSLAVE. Who's there?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is Euripides at home?\r\n\r\nSLAVE. He is and he isn't; understand that, if you have wit for't.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. How? He is and he isn't![206]\r\n\r\nSLAVE. Certainly, old man; busy gathering subtle fancies here and there,\r\nhis mind is not in the house, but he himself is; perched aloft, he is\r\ncomposing a tragedy.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, Euripides, you are indeed happy to have a slave so quick\r\nat repartee! Now, fellow, call your master.\r\n\r\nSLAVE. Impossible!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. So much the worse. But I will not go. Come, let us knock at\r\nthe door. Euripides, my little Euripides, my darling Euripides, listen;\r\nnever had man greater right to your pity. It is Dicaeopolis of the\r\nChollidan Deme who calls you. Do you hear?\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. I have no time to waste.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Very well, have yourself wheeled out here.[207]\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Impossible.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Nevertheless....\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Well, let them roll me out; as to coming down, I have not the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Euripides....\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. What words strike my ear?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. You perch aloft to compose tragedies, when you might just as\r\nwell do them on the ground. I am not astonished at your introducing\r\ncripples on the stage.[208] And why dress in these miserable tragic rags?\r\nI do not wonder that your heroes are beggars. But, Euripides, on my knees\r\nI beseech you, give me the tatters of some old piece: for I have to treat\r\nthe Chorus to a long speech, and if I do it ill it is all over with me.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. What rags do you prefer? Those in which I rigged out\r\nAeneus[209] on the stage, that unhappy, miserable old man?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, I want those of some hero still more unfortunate.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Of Phoenix, the blind man?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, not of Phoenix, you have another hero more unfortunate\r\nthan him.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Now, what tatters _does_ he want? Do you mean those of the\r\nbeggar Philoctetes?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, of another far more the mendicant.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Is it the filthy dress of the lame fellow, Bellerophon?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, 'tis not Bellerophon; he, whom I mean, was not only lame\r\nand a beggar, but boastful and a fine speaker.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Ah! I know, it is Telephus, the Mysian.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, Telephus. Give me his rags, I beg of you.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Slave! give him Telephus' tatters; they are on top of the rags\r\nof Thyestes and mixed with those of Ino.\r\n\r\nSLAVE. Catch hold! here they are.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! Zeus, whose eye pierces everywhere and embraces all,\r\npermit me to assume the most wretched dress on earth. Euripides, cap your\r\nkindness by giving me the little Mysian hat, that goes so well with these\r\ntatters. I must to-day have the look of a beggar; \"be what I am, but not\r\nappear to be\";[210] the audience will know well who I am, but the Chorus\r\nwill be fools enough not to, and I shall dupe 'em with my subtle phrases.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. I will give you the hat; I love the clever tricks of an\r\ningenious brain like yours.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Rest happy, and may it befall Telephus as I wish. Ah! I\r\nalready feel myself filled with quibbles. But I must have a beggar's\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Here you are, and now get you gone from this porch.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, my soul! You see how you are driven from this house,\r\nwhen I still need so many accessories. But let us be pressing, obstinate,\r\nimportunate. Euripides, give me a little basket with a lamp alight\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Whatever do you want such a thing as that for?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I do not need it, but I want it all the same.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. You importune me; get you gone!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Alas! may the gods grant you a destiny as brilliant as your\r\nmother's.[211]\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Leave me in peace.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! just a little broken cup.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Take it and go and hang yourself. What a tiresome fellow!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! you do not know all the pain you cause me. Dear, good\r\nEuripides, nothing beyond a small pipkin stoppered with a sponge.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Miserable man! You are robbing me of an entire tragedy.[212]\r\nHere, take it and be off.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I am going, but, great gods! I need one thing more; unless I\r\nhave it, I am a dead man. Hearken, my little Euripides, only give me this\r\nand I go, never to return. For pity's sake, do give me a few small herbs\r\nfor my basket.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. You wish to ruin me then. Here, take what you want; but it is\r\nall over with my pieces!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I won't ask another thing; I'm going. I am too importunate\r\nand forget that I rouse against me the hate of kings.--Ah! wretch that I\r\nam! I am lost! I have forgotten one thing, without which all the rest is\r\nas nothing. Euripides, my excellent Euripides, my dear little Euripides,\r\nmay I die if I ask you again for the smallest present; only one, the\r\nlast, absolutely the last; give me some of the chervil your mother left\r\nyou in her will.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES. Insolent hound! Slave, lock the door.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, my soul! I must go away without the chervil. Art thou\r\nsensible of the dangerous battle we are about to engage upon in defending\r\nthe Lacedaemonians? Courage, my soul, we must plunge into the midst of\r\nit. Dost thou hesitate and art thou fully steeped in Euripides? That's\r\nright! do not falter, my poor heart, and let us risk our head to say what\r\nwe hold for truth. Courage and boldly to the front. I wonder I am so\r\nbrave!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What do you purport doing? what are you going to say? What an\r\nimpudent fellow! what a brazen heart! To dare to stake his head and\r\nuphold an opinion contrary to that of us all! And he does not tremble to\r\nface this peril! Come, it is you who desired it, speak!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Spectators, be not angered if, although I am a beggar, I\r\ndare in a Comedy to speak before the people of Athens of the public weal;\r\nComedy too can sometimes discern what is right. I shall not please, but I\r\nshall say what is true. Besides, Cleon shall not be able to accuse me of\r\nattacking Athens before strangers;[213] we are by ourselves at the\r\nfestival of the Lenaea; the period when our allies send us their tribute\r\nand their soldiers is not yet. Here is only the pure wheat without chaff;\r\nas to the resident strangers settled among us, they and the citizens are\r\none, like the straw and the ear.\r\n\r\nI detest the Lacedaemonians with all my heart, and may Posidon, the god\r\nof Taenarus,[214] cause an earthquake and overturn their dwellings! My\r\nvines also have been cut. But come (there are only friends who hear me),\r\nwhy accuse the Laconians of all our woes? Some men (I do not say the\r\ncity, note particularly, that I do not say the city), some wretches, lost\r\nin vices, bereft of honour, who were not even citizens of good stamp, but\r\nstrangers, have accused the Megarians of introducing their produce\r\nfraudulently, and not a cucumber, a leveret, a sucking-pig, a clove of\r\ngarlic, a lump of salt was seen without its being said, \"Halloa! these\r\ncome from Megara,\" and their being instantly confiscated. Thus far the\r\nevil was not serious, and we were the only sufferers. But now some young\r\ndrunkards go to Megara and carry off the courtesan Simaetha; the\r\nMegarians, hurt to the quick, run off in turn with two harlots of the\r\nhouse of Aspasia; and so for three gay women Greece is set ablaze. Then\r\nPericles, aflame with ire on his Olympian height, let loose the\r\nlightning, caused the thunder to roll, upset Greece and passed an edict,\r\nwhich ran like the song, \"That the Megarians be banished both from our\r\nland and from our markets and from the sea and from the continent.\"[215]\r\nMeanwhile the Megarians, who were beginning to die of hunger, begged the\r\nLacedaemonians to bring about the abolition of the decree, of which those\r\nharlots were the cause; several times we refused their demand; and from\r\nthat time there was a horrible clatter of arms everywhere. You will say\r\nthat Sparta was wrong, but what should she have done? Answer that.\r\nSuppose that a Lacedaemonian had seized a little Seriphian[216] dog on\r\nany pretext and had sold it, would you have endured it quietly? Far from\r\nit, you would at once have sent three hundred vessels to sea, and what an\r\nuproar there would have been through all the city! there 'tis a band of\r\nnoisy soldiery, here a brawl about the election of a Trierarch; elsewhere\r\npay is being distributed, the Pallas figure-heads are being regilded,\r\ncrowds are surging under the market porticos, encumbered with wheat that\r\nis being measured, wine-skins, oar-leathers, garlic, olives, onions in\r\nnets; everywhere are chaplets, sprats, flute-girls, black eyes; in the\r\narsenal bolts are being noisily driven home, sweeps are being made and\r\nfitted with leathers; we hear nothing but the sound of whistles, of\r\nflutes and fifes to encourage the work-folk. That is what you assuredly\r\nwould have done, and would not Telephus have done the same? So I come to\r\nmy general conclusion; we have no common sense.\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Oh! wretch! oh! infamous man! You are naught but a\r\nbeggar and yet you dare to talk to us like this! you insult their\r\nworships the informers!\r\n\r\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. By Posidon! he speaks the truth; he has not lied in a\r\nsingle detail.\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. But though it be true, need he say it? But you'll have\r\nno great cause to be proud of your insolence!\r\n\r\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. Where are you running to? Don't you move; if you\r\nstrike this man I shall be at you.\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. Lamachus, whose glance flashes lightning, whose plume\r\npetrifies thy foes, help! Oh! Lamachus, my friend, the hero of my tribe\r\nand all of you, both officers and soldiers, defenders of our walls, come\r\nto my aid; else is it all over with me!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Whence comes this cry of battle? where must I bring my aid?\r\nwhere must I sow dread? who wants me to uncase my dreadful Gorgon's\r\nhead?[217]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, Lamachus, great hero! Your plumes and your cohorts\r\nterrify me.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This man, Lamachus, incessantly abuses Athens.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. You are but a mendicant and you dare to use language of this\r\nsort?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh, brave Lamachus, forgive a beggar who speaks at hazard.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. But what have you said? Let us hear.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I know nothing about it; the sight of weapons makes me\r\ndizzy. Oh! I adjure you, take that fearful Gorgon somewhat farther away.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. There.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Now place it face downwards on the ground.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. It is done.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Give me a plume out of your helmet.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Here is a feather.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And hold my head while I vomit; the plumes have turned my\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Hah! what are you proposing to do? do you want to make yourself\r\nvomit with this feather?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is it a feather? what bird's? a braggart's?\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Ah! ah! I will rip you open.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, Lamachus! Violence is out of place here! But as you\r\nare so strong, why did you not circumcise me? You have all you want for\r\nthe operation there.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. A beggar dares thus address a general!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. How? Am I a beggar?\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. What are you then?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who am I? A good citizen, not ambitious; a soldier, who has\r\nfought well since the outbreak of the war, whereas you are but a vile\r\nmercenary.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. They elected me....\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, three cuckoos did![218] If I have concluded peace,\r\n'twas disgust that drove me; for I see men with hoary heads in the ranks\r\nand young fellows of your age shirking service. Some are in Thrace\r\ngetting an allowance of three drachmae, such fellows as Tisameophoenippus\r\nand Panurgipparchides. The others are with Chares or in Chaonia, men like\r\nGeretotheodorus and Diomialazon; there are some of the same kidney, too,\r\nat Camarina and at Gela,[219] the laughing-stock of all and sundry.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. They were elected.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And why do you always receive your pay, when none of these\r\nothers ever get any? Speak, Marilades, you have grey hair; well then,\r\nhave you ever been entrusted with a mission? See! he shakes his head. Yet\r\nhe is an active as well as a prudent man. And you, Dracyllus, Euphorides\r\nor Prinides, have you knowledge of Ecbatana or Chaonia? You say no, do\r\nyou not? Such offices are good for the son of Caesyra[220] and Lamachus,\r\nwho, but yesterday ruined with debt, never pay their shot, and whom all\r\ntheir friends avoid as foot passengers dodge the folks who empty their\r\nslops out of window.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! in freedom's name! are such exaggerations to be borne?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Lamachus is well content; no doubt he is well paid, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. But I propose always to war with the Peloponnesians, both at\r\nsea, on land and everywhere to make them tremble, and trounce them\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. For my own part, I make proclamation to all Peloponnesians,\r\nMegarians and Boeotians, that to them my markets are open; but I debar\r\nLamachus from entering them.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Convinced by this man's speech, the folk have changed their view\r\nand approve him for having concluded peace. But let us prepare for the\r\nrecital of the parabasis.[221]\r\n\r\nNever since our poet presented Comedies, has he praised himself upon the\r\nstage; but, having been slandered by his enemies amongst the volatile\r\nAthenians, accused of scoffing at his country and of insulting the\r\npeople, to-day he wishes to reply and regain for himself the inconstant\r\nAthenians. He maintains that he has done much that is good for you; if\r\nyou no longer allow yourselves to be too much hoodwinked by strangers or\r\nseduced by flattery, if in politics you are no longer the ninnies you\r\nonce were, it is thanks to him. Formerly, when delegates from other\r\ncities wanted to deceive you, they had but to style you, \"the people\r\ncrowned with violets,\" and, at the word \"violets\" you at once sat erect\r\non the tips of your bums. Or, if to tickle your vanity, someone spoke of\r\n\"rich and sleek Athens,\" in return for that 'sleekness' he would get all,\r\nbecause he spoke of you as he would have of anchovies in oil. In\r\ncautioning you against such wiles, the poet has done you great service as\r\nwell as in forcing you to understand what is really the democratic\r\nprinciple. Thus, the strangers, who came to pay their tributes, wanted to\r\nsee this great poet, who had dared to speak the truth to Athens. And so\r\nfar has the fame of his boldness reached that one day the Great King,\r\nwhen questioning the Lacedaemonian delegates, first asked them which of\r\nthe two rival cities was the superior at sea, and then immediately\r\ndemanded at which it was that the comic poet directed his biting satire.\r\n\"Happy that city,\" he added, \"if it listens to his counsel; it will grow\r\nin power, and its victory is assured.\" This is why the Lacedaemonians\r\noffer you peace, if you will cede them Aegina; not that they care for the\r\nisle, but they wish to rob you of your poet.[222] As for you, never lose\r\nhim, who will always fight for the cause of justice in his Comedies; he\r\npromises you that his precepts will lead you to happiness, though he uses\r\nneither flattery, nor bribery, nor intrigue, nor deceit; instead of\r\nloading you with praise, he will point you to the better way. I scoff at\r\nCleon's tricks and plotting; honesty and justice shall fight my cause;\r\nnever will you find me a political poltroon, a prostitute to the highest\r\nbidder.\r\n\r\nI invoke thee, Acharnian Muse, fierce and fell as the devouring fire;\r\nsudden as the spark that bursts from the crackling oaken coal when roused\r\nby the quickening fan to fry little fishes, while others knead the dough\r\nor whip the sharp Thasian pickle with rapid hand, so break forth, my\r\nMuse, and inspire thy tribesmen with rough, vigorous, stirring strains.\r\n\r\nWe others, now old men and heavy with years, we reproach the city; so\r\nmany are the victories we have gained for the Athenian fleets that we\r\nwell deserve to be cared for in our declining life; yet far from this, we\r\nare ill-used, harassed with law-suits, delivered over to the scorn of\r\nstripling orators. Our minds and bodies being ravaged with age, Posidon\r\nshould protect us, yet we have no other support than a staff. When\r\nstanding before the judge, we can scarcely stammer forth the fewest\r\nwords, and of justice we see but its barest shadow, whereas the accuser,\r\ndesirous of conciliating the younger men, overwhelms us with his ready\r\nrhetoric; he drags us before the judge, presses us with questions, lays\r\ntraps for us; the onslaught troubles, upsets and rends poor old Tithonus,\r\nwho, crushed with age, stands tongue-tied; sentenced to a fine,[223] he\r\nweeps, he sobs and says to his friend, \"This fine robs me of the last\r\ntrifle that was to have bought my coffin.\"\r\n\r\nIs this not a scandal? What! the clepsydra[224] is to kill the\r\nwhite-haired veteran, who, in fierce fighting, has so oft covered himself\r\nwith glorious sweat, whose valour at Marathon saved the country! 'Twas we\r\nwho pursued on the field of Marathon, whereas now 'tis wretches who\r\npursue us to the death and crush us! What would Marpsias reply to\r\nthis?[225] What an injustice, that a man, bent with age like Thucydides,\r\nshould be brow-beaten by this braggart advocate, Cephisodemus,[226] who\r\nis as savage as the Scythian desert he was born in! Is it not to convict\r\nhim from the outset? I wept tears of pity when I saw an Archer[227]\r\nmaltreat this old man, who, by Ceres, when he was young and the true\r\nThucydides, would not have permitted an insult from Ceres herself! At\r\nthat date he would have floored ten miserable orators, he would have\r\nterrified three thousand Archers with his shouts; he would have pierced\r\nthe whole line of the enemy with his shafts. Ah! but if you will not\r\nleave the aged in peace, decree that the advocates be matched; thus the\r\nold man will only be confronted with a toothless greybeard, the young\r\nwill fight with the braggart, the ignoble with the son of Clinias[228];\r\nmake a law that in future, the old man can only be summoned and convicted\r\nat the courts by the aged and the young man by the youth.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. These are the confines of my market-place. All\r\nPeloponnesians, Megarians, Boeotians, have the right to come and trade\r\nhere, provided they sell their wares to me and not to Lamachus. As\r\nmarket-inspectors I appoint these three whips of Leprean[229] leather,\r\nchosen by lot. Warned away are all informers and all men of Phasis.[230]\r\nThey are bringing me the pillar on which the treaty is inscribed[231] and\r\nI shall erect it in the centre of the market, well in sight of all.\r\n\r\nA MEGARIAN. Hail! market of Athens, beloved of Megarians. Let Zeus, the\r\npatron of friendship, witness, I regretted you as a mother mourns her\r\nson. Come, poor little daughters of an unfortunate father, try to find\r\nsomething to eat; listen to me with the full heed of an empty belly.\r\nWhich would you prefer? To be sold or to cry with hunger.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTERS. To be sold, to be sold!\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. That is my opinion too. But who would make so sorry a deal as\r\nto buy you? Ah! I recall me a Megarian trick; I am going to disguise you\r\nas little porkers, that I am offering for sale. Fit your hands with these\r\nhoofs and take care to appear the issue of a sow of good breed, for, if I\r\nam forced to take you back to the house, by Hermes! you will suffer\r\ncruelly of hunger! Then fix on these snouts and cram yourselves into this\r\nsack. Forget not to grunt and to say wee-wee like the little pigs that\r\nare sacrificed in the Mysteries. I must summon Dicaeopolis. Where is he?\r\nDicaeopolis, will you buy some nice little porkers?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who are you? a Megarian?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. I have come to your market.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, how are things at Megara?[232]\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. We are crying with hunger at our firesides.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. The fireside is jolly enough with a piper. But what else is\r\ndoing at Megara, eh?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. What else? When I left for the market, the authorities were\r\ntaking steps to let us die in the quickest manner.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. That is the best way to get you out of all your troubles.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. True.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What other news of Megara? What is wheat selling at?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. With us it is valued as highly as the very gods in heaven!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Is it salt that you are bringing?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Are you not holding back the salt?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. 'Tis garlic then?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. What! garlic! do you not at every raid grub up the ground with\r\nyour pikes to pull out every single head?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What _do_ you bring then?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Little sows, like those they immolate at the Mysteries.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! very well, show me them.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. They are very fine; feel their weight. See! how fat and fine.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But what is this?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. A _sow_, for a certainty.[233]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. You say a sow! of what country, then?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. From Megara. What! is that not a sow then?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, I don't believe it is.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. This is too much! what an incredulous man! He says 'tis not a\r\nsow; but we will stake, an you will, a measure of salt ground up with\r\nthyme, that in good Greek this is called a sow and nothing else.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But a sow of the human kind.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Without question, by Diocles! of my own breed! Well! What think\r\nyou? will you hear them squeal?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well, yes, i' faith, I will.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Cry quickly, wee sowlet; squeak up, hussy, or by Hermes! I take\r\nyou back to the house.\r\n\r\nGIRL. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Is that a little sow, or not?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Yes, it seems so; but let it grow up, and it will be a fine\r\nfat cunt.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. In five years it will be just like its mother.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But it cannot be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. And why not?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. It has no tail.[234]\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Because it is quite young, but in good time it will have a big\r\none, thick and red.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. The two are as like as two peas.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. They are born of the same father and mother; let them be\r\nfattened, let them grow their bristles, and they will be the finest sows\r\nyou can offer to Aphrodité.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But sows are not immolated to Aphrodité.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Not sows to Aphrodité! Why, 'tis the only goddess to whom they\r\nare offered! the flesh of my sows will be excellent on the spit.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Can they eat alone? They no longer need their mother!\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Certainly not, nor their father.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What do they like most?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Whatever is given them; but ask for yourself.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Speak! little sow.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Can you eat chick-pease?[235]\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee, wee-wee!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And Attic figs?\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER. Wee-wee, wee-wee!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What sharp squeaks at the name of figs. Come, let some figs\r\nbe brought for these little pigs. Will they eat them? Goodness! how they\r\nmunch them, what a grinding of teeth, mighty Heracles! I believe those\r\npigs hail from the land of the Voracians. But surely, 'tis impossible\r\nthey have bolted all the figs!\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Yes, certainly, bar this one that I took from them.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! what funny creatures! For what sum will you sell them?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. I will give you one for a bunch of garlic, and the other, if\r\nyou like, for a quart measure of salt.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I buy them of you. Wait for me here.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. The deal is done. Hermes, god of good traders, grant I may sell\r\nboth my wife and my mother in the same way!\r\n\r\nAN INFORMER. Hi! fellow, what countryman are you?\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. I am a pig-merchant from Megara.\r\n\r\nINFORMER. I shall denounce both your pigs and yourself as public enemies.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Ah! here our troubles begin afresh!\r\n\r\nINFORMER. Let go that sack. I will punish your Megarian lingo.[236]\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Dicaeopolis, Dicaeopolis, they want to denounce me.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who dares do this thing? Inspectors, drive out the\r\nInformers. Ah! you offer to enlighten us without a lamp![237]\r\n\r\nINFORMER. What! I may not denounce our enemies?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Have a care for yourself, if you don't go off pretty quick\r\nto denounce elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. What a plague to Athens!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Be reassured, Megarian. Here is the value of your two swine,\r\nthe garlic and the salt. Farewell and much happiness!\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Ah! we never have that amongst us.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Well! may the inopportune wish apply to myself.\r\n\r\nMEGARIAN. Farewell, dear little sows, and seek, far from your father, to\r\nmunch your bread with salt, if they give you any.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Here is a man truly happy. See how everything succeeds to his\r\nwish. Peacefully seated in his market, he will earn his living; woe to\r\nCtesias,[238] and all other informers, who dare to enter there! You will\r\nnot be cheated as to the value of wares, you will not again see\r\nPrepis[239] wiping his foul rump, nor will Cleonymus[240] jostle you; you\r\nwill take your walks, clothed in a fine tunic, without meeting\r\nHyperbolus[241] and his unceasing quibblings, without being accosted on\r\nthe public place by any importunate fellow, neither by Cratinus,[242]\r\nshaven in the fashion of the debauchees, nor by this musician, who\r\nplagues us with his silly improvisations, Artemo, with his arm-pits\r\nstinking as foul as a goat, like his father before him. You will not be\r\nthe butt of the villainous Pauson's[243] jeers, nor of Lysistratus,[244]\r\nthe disgrace of the Cholargian deme, who is the incarnation of all the\r\nvices, and endures cold and hunger more than thirty days in the month.\r\n\r\nA BOEOTIAN. By Heracles! my shoulder is quite black and blue. Ismenias,\r\nput the penny-royal down there very gently, and all of you, musicians\r\nfrom Thebes, pipe with your bone flutes into a dog's rump.[245]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Enough, enough, get you gone. Rascally hornets, away with\r\nyou! Whence has sprung this accursed swarm of Cheris[246] fellows which\r\ncomes assailing my door?\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Ah! by Iolas![247] Drive them off, my dear host, you will\r\nplease me immensely; all the way from Thebes, they were there piping\r\nbehind me and have completely stripped my penny-royal of its blossom. But\r\nwill you buy anything of me, some chickens or some locusts?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! good day, Boeotian, eater of good round loaves.[248]\r\nWhat do you bring?\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. All that is good in Boeotia, marjoram, penny-royal, rush-mats,\r\nlamp-wicks, ducks, jays, woodcocks, waterfowl, wrens, divers.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. 'Tis a very hail of birds that beats down on my market.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. I also bring geese, hares, foxes, moles, hedgehogs, cats,\r\nlyres, martins, otters and eels from the Copaic lake.[249]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! my friend, you, who bring me the most delicious of fish,\r\nlet me salute your eels.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Come, thou, the eldest of my fifty Copaic virgins, come and\r\ncomplete the joy of our host.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! my well-beloved, thou object of my long regrets, thou\r\nart here at last then, thou, after whom the comic poets sigh, thou, who\r\nart dear to Morychus.[250] Slaves, hither with the stove and the bellows.\r\nLook at this charming eel, that returns to us after six long years of\r\nabsence.[251] Salute it, my children; as for myself, I will supply coal\r\nto do honour to the stranger. Take it into my house; death itself could\r\nnot separate me from her, if cooked with beet leaves.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. And what will you give me in return?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. It will pay for your market dues. And as to the rest, what\r\ndo you wish to sell me?\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Why, everything.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. On what terms? For ready-money or in wares from these parts?\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. I would take some Athenian produce, that we have not got in\r\nBoeotia.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Phaleric anchovies, pottery?\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Anchovies, pottery? But these we have. I want produce that is\r\nwanting with us and that is plentiful here.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! I have the very thing; take away an Informer, packed up\r\ncarefully as crockery-ware.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. By the twin gods! I should earn big money, if I took one; I\r\nwould exhibit him as an ape full of spite.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hah! here we have Nicarchus,[252] who comes to denounce you.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. How small he is!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But in his case the whole is one mass of ill-nature.\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. Whose are these goods?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Mine; they come from Boeotia, I call Zeus to witness.\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. I denounce them as coming from an enemy's country.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. What! you declare war against birds?\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. And I am going to denounce you too.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. What harm have I done you?\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. I will say it for the benefit of those that listen; you\r\nintroduce lamp-wicks from an enemy's country.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Then you go as far as denouncing a wick.\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. It needs but one to set an arsenal afire.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. A wick set an arsenal ablaze! But how, great gods?\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS. Should a Boeotian attach it to an insect's wing, and, taking\r\nadvantage of a violent north wind, throw it by means of a tube into the\r\narsenal and the fire once get hold of the vessels, everything would soon\r\nbe devoured by the flames.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! wretch! an insect and a wick would devour everything.\r\n(_He strikes him_.)\r\n\r\nNICARCHUS (_to the Chorus_). You will bear witness, that he mishandles\r\nme.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Shut his mouth. Give him some hay; I am going to pack him up\r\nas a vase, that he may not get broken on the road.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Pack up your goods carefully, friend; that the stranger may not\r\nbreak it when taking it away.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall take great care with it, for one would say he is\r\ncracked already; he rings with a false note, which the gods abhor.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. But what will be done with him?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is a vase good for all purposes; it will be used as a\r\nvessel for holding all foul things, a mortar for pounding together\r\nlaw-suits, a lamp for spying upon accounts, and as a cup for the mixing\r\nup and poisoning of everything.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. None could ever trust a vessel for domestic use that has such a\r\nring about it.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! it is strong, my friend, and will never get broken, if\r\ncare is taken to hang it head downwards.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. There! it is well packed now!\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Marry, I will proceed to carry off my bundle.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Farewell, worthiest of strangers, take this Informer, good for\r\nanything, and fling him where you like.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Bah! this rogue has given me enough trouble to pack! Here!\r\nBoeotian, pick up your pottery.\r\n\r\nBOEOTIAN. Stoop, Ismenias, that I may put it on your shoulder, and be\r\nvery careful with it.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. You carry nothing worth having; however, take it, for you\r\nwill profit by your bargain; the Informers will bring you luck.\r\n\r\nA SERVANT OF LAMACHUS. Dicaeopolis!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What do want crying this gait?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Lamachus wants to keep the Feast of Cups,[253] and I come by his\r\norder to bid you one drachma for some thrushes and three more for a\r\nCopaic eel.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And who is this Lamachus, who demands an eel?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. 'Tis the terrible, indefatigable Lamachus, he, who is always\r\nbrandishing his fearful Gorgon's head and the three plumes which\r\no'ershadow his helmet.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, no, he will get nothing, even though he gave me his\r\nbuckler. Let him eat salt fish, while he shakes his plumes, and, if he\r\ncomes here making any din, I shall call the inspectors. As for myself, I\r\nshall take away all these goods; I go home on thrushes' wings and\r\nblackbirds' pinions.[254]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You see, citizens, you see the good fortune which this man owes\r\nto his prudence, to his profound wisdom. You see how, since he has\r\nconcluded peace, he buys what is useful in the household and good to eat\r\nhot. All good things flow towards him unsought. Never will I welcome the\r\ngod of war in my house; never shall he chant the 'Harmodius' at my\r\ntable;[255] he is a sot, who comes feasting with those who are\r\noverflowing with good things and brings all sorts of mischief at his\r\nheels. He overthrows, ruins, rips open; 'tis vain to make him a thousand\r\noffers, \"be seated, pray, drink this cup, proffered in all friendship,\"\r\nhe burns our vine-stocks and brutally pours out the wine from our\r\nvineyards on the ground. This man, on the other hand, covers his table\r\nwith a thousand dishes; proud of his good fortunes, he has had these\r\nfeathers cast before his door to show us how he lives.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! Peace! companion of fair Aphrodité and of the sweet\r\nGraces, how charming are your features and yet I never knew it! Would\r\nthat Eros might join me to thee, Eros, crowned with roses as Zeuxis[256]\r\nshows him to us! Perhaps I seem somewhat old to you, but I am yet able to\r\nmake you a threefold offering; despite my age, I could plant a long row\r\nof vines for you; then beside these some tender cuttings from the fig;\r\nfinally a young vine-stock, loaded with fruit and all round the field\r\nolive trees, which would furnish us with oil, wherewith to anoint us both\r\nat the New Moons.\r\n\r\nHERALD. List, ye people! As was the custom of your forebears, empty a\r\nfull pitcher of wine at the call of the trumpet; he, who first sees the\r\nbottom, shall get a wine-skin as round and plump as Ctesiphon's belly.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Women, children, have you not heard? Faith! do you not heed\r\nthe herald? Quick! let the hares boil and roast merrily; keep them\r\na-turning; withdraw them from the flame; prepare the chaplets; reach me\r\nthe skewers that I may spit the thrushes.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. I envy you your wisdom and even more your good cheer.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What then will you say when you see the thrushes roasting?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Ah! true indeed!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave! stir up the fire.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. See, how he knows his business, what a perfect cook! How well he\r\nunderstands the way to prepare a good dinner!\r\n\r\nA HUSBANDMAN. Ah! woe is me!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Heracles! What have we here?\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. A most miserable man.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Keep your misery for yourself.\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Ah! friend! since you alone are enjoying peace, grant me a\r\npart of your truce, were it but five years.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What has happened to you?\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. I am ruined; I have lost a pair of steers.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. How?\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. The Boeotians seized them at Phylé.[257]\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! poor wretch! and yet you have not left off white?\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Their dung made my wealth.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What can I do in the matter?\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Crying for my beasts has lost me my eyesight. Ah! if you care\r\nfor poor Dercetes of Phylé, anoint mine eyes quickly with your balm of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But, my poor fellow, I do not practise medicine.\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Come, I adjure you; perchance I shall recover my steers.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. 'Tis impossible; away, go and whine to the disciples of\r\nPittalus.[258]\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Grant me but one drop of peace; pour it into this reedlet.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. No, not a particle; go a-weeping elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN. Oh! oh! oh! my poor beasts!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This man has discovered the sweetest enjoyment in peace; he will\r\nshare it with none.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pour honey over this tripe; set it before the fire to dry.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. What lofty tones he uses! Did you hear him?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Get the eels on the gridiron!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You are killing me with hunger; your smoke is choking your\r\nneighbours, and you split our ears with your bawling.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Have this fried and let it be nicely browned.\r\n\r\nA BRIDESMAID. Dicaeopolis! Dicaeopolis!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Who are you?\r\n\r\nBRIDESMAID. A young bridegroom sends you these viands from the marriage\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Whoever he be, I thank him.\r\n\r\nBRIDESMAID. And in return, he prays you to pour a glass of peace into\r\nthis vase, that he may not have to go to the front and may stay at home\r\nto do his duty to his young wife.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take back, take back your viands; for a thousand drachmae I\r\nwould not give a drop of peace; but who are you, pray?\r\n\r\nBRIDESMAID. I am the bridesmaid; she wants to say something to you from\r\nthe bride privately.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Come, what do you wish to say? (_The bridesmaid whispers in\r\nhis ear._) _Ah!_ what a ridiculous demand! The bride burns with longing\r\nto keep by her her husband's weapon. Come! bring hither my truce; to her\r\nalone will I give some of it, for she is a woman, and, as such, should\r\nnot suffer under the war. Here, friend, reach hither your vial. And as to\r\nthe manner of applying this balm, tell the bride, when a levy of soldiers\r\nis made to rub some in bed on her husband, where most needed. There,\r\nslave, take away my truce! Now, quick hither with the wine-flagon, that I\r\nmay fill up the drinking bowls!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. I see a man, striding along apace, with knitted brows; he seems\r\nto us the bearer of terrible tidings.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Oh! toils and battles! 'tis Lamachus!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. What noise resounds around my dwelling, where shines the glint\r\nof arms.\r\n\r\nHERALD. The Generals order you forthwith to take your battalions and your\r\nplumes, and, despite the snow, to go and guard our borders. They have\r\nlearnt that a band of Boeotians intend taking advantage of the feast of\r\nCups to invade our country.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Ah! the Generals! they are numerous, but not good for much!\r\nIt's cruel, not to be able to enjoy the feast!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Oh! warlike host of Lamachus!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Wretch! do you dare to jeer me?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Do you want to fight this four-winged Geryon?\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! oh! what fearful tidings!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! ah! I see another herald running up; what news does he\r\nbring me?\r\n\r\nHERALD. Dicaeopolis!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What is the matter?\r\n\r\nHERALD. Come quickly to the feast and bring your basket and your cup;\r\n'tis the priest of Bacchus who invites you. But hasten, the guests have\r\nbeen waiting for you a long while. All is ready--couches, tables,\r\ncushions, chaplets, perfumes, dainties and courtesans to boot; biscuits,\r\ncakes, sesamé-bread, tarts, and--lovely dancing women, the sweetest charm\r\nof the festivity. But come with all haste.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! hostile gods!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. This is not astounding; you have chosen this huge, great\r\nugly Gorgon's head for your patron. You, shut the door, and let someone\r\nget ready the meal.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave! slave! my knapsack!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave! slave! a basket!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Take salt and thyme, slave, and don't forget the onions.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Get some fish for me; I cannot bear onions.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave, wrap me up a little stale salt meat in a fig-leaf.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And for me some good greasy tripe in a fig-leaf; I will have\r\nit cooked here.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Bring me the plumes for my helmet.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Bring me wild pigeons and thrushes.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. How white and beautiful are these ostrich feathers!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. How fat and well browned is the flesh of this wood-pigeon!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Bring me the case for my triple plume.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pass me over that dish of hare.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. _Oh!_ the moths have eaten the hair of my crest!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I shall always eat hare before dinner.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Hi! friend! try not to scoff at my armour.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hi! friend! will you kindly not stare at my thrushes.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Hi! friend! will you kindly not address me.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. I do not address you; I am scolding my slave. Shall we wager\r\nand submit the matter to Lamachus, which of the two is the best to eat, a\r\nlocust or a thrush?\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Insolent hound!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. He much prefers the locusts.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave, unhook my spear and bring it to me.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave, slave, take the sausage from the fire and bring it to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Come, let me draw my spear from its sheath. Hold it, slave,\r\nhold it tight.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And you, slave, grip, grip well hold of the skewer.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave, the bracings for my shield.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pull the loaves out of the oven and bring me these bracings\r\nof my stomach.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. My round buckler with the Gorgon's head.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. My round cheese-cake.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. What clumsy wit!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. What delicious cheese-cake!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Pour oil on the buckler. Hah! hah! I can see an old man who\r\nwill be accused of cowardice.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pour honey on the cake. Hah! hah! I can see an old man who\r\nmakes Lamachus of the Gorgon's head weep with rage.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave, full war armour.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Slave, my beaker; that is _my_ armour.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. With this I hold my ground with any foe.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And I with this with any tosspot.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Fasten the strappings to the buckler; personally I shall carry\r\nthe knapsack.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Pack the dinner well into the basket; personally I shall\r\ncarry the cloak.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Slave, take up the buckler and let's be off. It is snowing! Ah!\r\n'tis a question of facing the winter.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take up the basket, 'tis a question of getting to the feast.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. We wish you both joy on your journeys, which differ so much. One\r\ngoes to mount guard and freeze, while the other will drink, crowned with\r\nflowers, and then sleep with a young beauty, who will rub his tool for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI say it freely; may Zeus confound Antimachus, the poet-historian, the\r\nson of Psacas! When Choregus at the Lenaea, alas! alas! he dismissed me\r\ndinnerless. May I see him devouring with his eyes a cuttle-fish, just\r\nserved, well cooked, hot and properly salted; and the moment that he\r\nstretches his hand to help himself, may a dog seize it and run off with\r\nit. Such is my first wish. I also hope for him a misfortune at night.\r\nThat returning all-fevered from horse practice, he may meet an\r\nOrestes,[259] mad with drink, who breaks open his head; that wishing to\r\nseize a stone, he, in the dark, may pick up a fresh stool, hurl his\r\nmissile, miss aim and hit Cratinus.[260]\r\n\r\nSLAVE OF LAMACHUS. Slaves of Lamachus! Water, water in a little pot! Make\r\nit warm, get ready cloths, cerate, greasy wool and bandages for his\r\nankle. In leaping a ditch, the master has hurt himself against a stake;\r\nhe has dislocated and twisted his ankle, broken his head by falling on a\r\nstone, while his Gorgon shot far away from his buckler. His mighty\r\nbraggadocio plume rolled on the ground; at this sight he uttered these\r\ndoleful words, \"Radiant star, I gaze on thee for the last time; my eyes\r\nclose to all light, I die.\" Having said this, he falls into the water,\r\ngets out again, meets some runaways and pursues the robbers with his\r\nspear at their backsides.[261] But here he comes, himself. Get the door\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! heavens! oh! heavens! What cruel pain! I faint, I tremble!\r\nAlas! I die! the foe's lance has struck me! But what would hurt me most\r\nwould be for Dicaeopolis to see me wounded thus and laugh at my\r\nill-fortune.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS (_enters with two courtesans_). Oh! my gods! what bosoms!\r\nHard as a quince! Come, my treasures, give me voluptuous kisses! Glue\r\nyour lips to mine. Haha! I was the first to empty my cup.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! cruel fate! how I suffer! accursed wounds!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Hah! hah! hail! Knight Lamachus! (_Embraces Lamachus._)\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. By the hostile gods! _(Bites Dicaeopolis.)_\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Ah! great gods!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Why do you embrace me?\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And why do you bite me?\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. 'Twas a cruel score I was paying back!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Scores are not evened at the feast of Cups!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! Paean, Paean!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. But to-day is not the feast of Paean.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Oh! support my leg, do; ah! hold it tenderly, my friends!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. And you, my darlings, take hold of my tool both of you!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. This blow with the stone makes me dizzy; my sight grows dim.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. For myself, I want to get to bed; I am bursting with\r\nlustfulness, I want to be fucking in the dark.\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. Carry me to the surgeon Pittalus.\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Take me to the judges. Where is the king of the feast? The\r\nwine-skin is mine!\r\n\r\nLAMACHUS. That spear has pierced my bones; what torture I endure!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. You see this empty cup! I triumph! I triumph!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Old man, I come at your bidding! You triumph! you triumph!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Again I have brimmed my cup with unmixed wine and drained it\r\nat a draught!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You triumph then, brave champion; thine is the wine-skin!\r\n\r\nDICAEOPOLIS. Follow me, singing \"Triumph! Triumph!\"\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Aye! we will sing of thee, thee and thy sacred wine-skin, and we\r\nall, as we follow thee, will repeat in thine honour, \"Triumph, Triumph!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFINIS OF \"THE ACHARNIANS\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[147] A name invented by Aristophanes and signifying 'a just citizen.'\r\n\r\n[148] Cleon had received five talents from the islanders subject to\r\nAthens, on condition that he should get the tribute payable by them\r\nreduced; when informed of this transaction, the Knights compelled him to\r\nreturn the money.\r\n\r\n[149] A hemistich borrowed from Euripides' 'Telephus.'\r\n\r\n[150] The tragedies of Aeschylus continued to be played even after the\r\npoet's death, which occurred in 436 B.C., ten years before the production\r\nof the Acharnians.\r\n\r\n[151] A tragic poet, whose pieces were so devoid of warmth and life that\r\nhe was nicknamed [Greek: chi_on], i.e. _snow_.\r\n\r\n[152] A bad musician, frequently ridiculed by Aristophanes; he played\r\nboth the lyre and the flute.\r\n\r\n[153] A lively and elevated method.\r\n\r\n[154] A hill near the Acropolis, where the Assemblies were held.\r\n\r\n[155] Several means were used to force citizens to attend the assemblies;\r\nthe shops were closed; circulation was only permitted in those streets\r\nwhich led to the Pnyx; finally, a rope covered with vermilion was drawn\r\nround those who dallied in the Agora (the marketplace), and the\r\nlate-comers, ear-marked by the imprint of the rope, were fined.\r\n\r\n[156] Magistrates who, with the Archons and the Epistatae, shared the\r\ncare of holding and directing the assemblies of the people; they were\r\nfifty in number.\r\n\r\n[157] The Peloponnesian War had already, at the date of the\r\nrepresentation of the 'Acharnians,' lasted five years, 431-426 B.C.;\r\ndriven from their lands by the successive Lacedaemonian invasions, the\r\npeople throughout the country had been compelled to seek shelter behind\r\nthe walls of Athens.\r\n\r\n[158] Shortly before the meeting of the Assembly, a number of young pigs\r\nwere immolated and a few drops of their blood were sprinkled on the seats\r\nof the Prytanes; this sacrifice was in honour of Ceres.\r\n\r\n[159] The name, Amphitheus, contains the word, [Greek: Theos], _god_.\r\n\r\n[160] Amongst other duties, it was the office of the Prytanes to look\r\nafter the wants of the poor.\r\n\r\n[161] The summer residence of the Great King.\r\n\r\n[162] Referring to the hardships he had endured garrisoning the walls of\r\nAthens during the Lacedaemonian invasions early in the War.\r\n\r\n[163] Cranaus, the second king of Athens, the successor of Cecrops.\r\n\r\n[164] Lucian, in his 'Hermotimus,' speaks of these golden mountains as an\r\napocryphal land of wonders and prodigies.\r\n\r\n[165] Cleonymus was an Athenian general of exceptionally tall stature;\r\nAristophanes incessantly rallies him for his cowardice; he had cast away\r\nhis buckler in a fight.\r\n\r\n[166] A name borne by certain officials of the King of Persia. The actor\r\nof this part wore a mask, fitted with a single eye of great size.\r\n\r\n[167] Jargon, no doubt meaningless in all languages.\r\n\r\n[168] The Persians styled all Greeks 'Ionians' without distinction; here\r\nthe Athenians are intended.\r\n\r\n[169] A Greek measure, containing about six modii.\r\n\r\n[170] Noted for his extreme ugliness and his obscenity. Aristophanes\r\nfrequently holds him to scorn in his comedies.\r\n\r\n[171] Ambassadors were entertained there at the public expense.\r\n\r\n[172] King of Thrace.\r\n\r\n[173] The tragic poet.\r\n\r\n[174] A feast lasting three days and celebrated during the month\r\nPyanepsion (November). The Greek word contains the suggestion of fraud\r\n([Greek: apat_e]).\r\n\r\n[175] A Thracian tribe from the right bank of the Strymon.\r\n\r\n[176] The Boeotians were the allies of Sparta.\r\n\r\n[177] Dicaeopolis had brought a clove of garlic with him to eat during\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n[178] Garlic was given to game-cocks, before setting them at each other,\r\nto give them pluck for the fight.\r\n\r\n[179] At the least unfavourable omen, the sitting of the Assembly was\r\ndeclared at an end.\r\n\r\n[180] The deme of Acharnae was largely inhabited by charcoal-burners, who\r\nsupplied the city with fuel.\r\n\r\n[181] He presents them in the form of wines contained in three separate\r\nskins.\r\n\r\n[182] Meaning, preparations for war.\r\n\r\n[183] Meaning, securing allies for the continuance of the war.\r\n\r\n[184] When Athens sent forth an army, the soldiers were usually ordered\r\nto assemble at some particular spot with provisions for three days.\r\n\r\n[185] These feasts were also called the Anthesteria or Lenaea; the\r\nLenaeum was a temple to Bacchus, erected outside the city. They took\r\nplace during the month Anthesterion (February).\r\n\r\n[186] A celebrated athlete from Croton and a victor at Olympia; he was\r\nequally good as a runner and at the 'five exercises' ([Greek:\r\npentathlon.]).\r\n\r\n[187] He had been Archon at the time of the battle of Marathon.\r\n\r\n[188] A sacred formula, pronounced by the priest before offering the\r\nsacrifice ([Greek: kan_ephoria]).\r\n\r\n[189] The maiden who carried the basket filled with fruits at the\r\nDionysia in honour of Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[190] The emblem of the fecundity of nature; it consisted of a\r\nrepresentation, generally grotesquely exaggerated, of the male genital\r\norgans; the phallophori crowned with violets and ivy and their faces\r\nshaded with green foliage, sang improvised airs, called 'Phallics,' full\r\nof obscenity and suggestive 'double entendres.'\r\n\r\n[191] The most propitious moment for Love's gambols, observes the\r\nscholiast.\r\n\r\n[192] Married women did not join in the processions.\r\n\r\n[193] The god of generation, worshipped in the form of a phallus.\r\n\r\n[194] A remark, which fixes the date of the production of the\r\n'Acharnians,' viz. the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War, 426 B.C.\r\n\r\n[195] Lamachus was an Athenian general, who figures later in this comedy.\r\n\r\n[196] At the rural Dionysia a pot of kitchen vegetables was borne in the\r\nprocession along with other emblems.\r\n\r\n[197] Cleon the Demagogue was a currier originally by trade. He was the\r\nsworn foe and particular detestation of the Knights or aristocratic party\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n[198] That is, the baskets of charcoal.\r\n\r\n[199] The stage of the Greek theatre was much broader, and at the same\r\ntime shallower, than in a modern playhouse.\r\n\r\n[200] A mountain in Attica, in the neighbourhood of Acharnae.\r\n\r\n[201] Orators in the pay of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[202] Satire on the Athenians' addiction to lawsuits.\r\n\r\n[203] 'The Babylonians.' Cleon had denounced Aristophanes to the senate\r\nfor having scoffed at Athens before strangers, many of whom were present\r\nat the performance. The play is now lost.\r\n\r\n[204] A tragic poet; we know next to nothing of him or his works.\r\n\r\n[205] Son of Aeolus, renowned in fable for his robberies, and for the\r\ntortures to which he was put by Pluto. He was cunning enough to break\r\nloose out of hell, but Hermes brought him back again.\r\n\r\n[206] This whole scene is directed at Euripides; Aristophanes ridicules\r\nthe subtleties of his poetry and the trickeries of his staging, which,\r\naccording to him, he only used to attract the less refined among his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n[207] \"Wheeled out\"--that is, by means of the [Greek: ekkukl_ema], a\r\nmechanical contrivance of the Greek stage, by which an interior was\r\nshown, the set scene with performers, etc., all complete, being in some\r\nway, which cannot be clearly made out from the descriptions, swung out or\r\nwheeled out on to the main stage.\r\n\r\n[208] Having been lamed, it is of course implied, by tumbling from the\r\nlofty apparatus on which the Author sat perched to write his tragedies.\r\n\r\n[209] Euripides delighted, or was supposed by his critic Aristophanes to\r\ndelight, in the representation of misery and wretchedness on the stage.\r\n'Aeneus,' 'Phoenix,' 'Philoctetes,' 'Bellerophon,' 'Telephus,' 'Ino' are\r\ntitles of six tragedies of his in this _genre_ of which fragments are\r\nextant.\r\n\r\n[210] Line borrowed from Euripides. A great number of verses are\r\nsimilarly parodied in this scene.\r\n\r\n[211] Report said that Euripides' mother had sold vegetables on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n[212] Aristophanes means, of course, to imply that the whole talent of\r\nEuripides lay in these petty details of stage property.\r\n\r\n[213] 'The Babylonians' had been produced at a time of year when Athens\r\nwas crowded with strangers; 'The Acharnians,' on the contrary, was played\r\nin December.\r\n\r\n[214] Sparta had been menaced with an earthquake in 427 B.C. Posidon was\r\n'The Earthshaker,' god of earthquakes, as well as of the sea.\r\n\r\n[215] A song by Timocreon the Rhodian, the words of which were\r\npractically identical with Pericles' decree.\r\n\r\n[216] A small and insignificant island, one of the Cyclades, allied with\r\nthe Athenians, like most of these islands previous to and during the\r\nfirst part of the Peloponnesian War.\r\n\r\n[217] A figure of Medusa's head, forming the centre of Lamachus' shield.\r\n\r\n[218] Indicates the character of his election, which was arranged, so\r\nAristophanes implies, by his partisans.\r\n\r\n[219] Towns in Sicily. There is a pun on the name Gela--[Greek: Gela] and\r\n[Greek: Katagela] (ridiculous)--which it is impossible to keep in\r\nEnglish. Apparently the Athenians had sent embassies to all parts of the\r\nGreek world to arrange treaties of alliance in view of the struggle with\r\nthe Lacedaemonians; but only young debauchees of aristocratic connections\r\nhad been chosen as envoys.\r\n\r\n[220] A contemporary orator apparently, otherwise unknown.\r\n\r\n[221] The _parabasis_ in the Old Comedy was a sort of address or topical\r\nharangue addressed directly by the poet, speaking by the Chorus, to the\r\naudience. It was nearly always political in bearing, and the subject of\r\nthe particular piece was for the time being set aside altogether.\r\n\r\n[222] It will be remembered that Aristophanes owned land in Aegina.\r\n\r\n[223] Everything was made the object of a law-suit at Athens. The old\r\nsoldiers, inexpert at speaking, often lost the day.\r\n\r\n[224] A water-clock used to limit the length of speeches in the courts.\r\n\r\n[225] A braggart speaker, fiery and pugnacious.\r\n\r\n[226] Cephisodemus was an Athenian, but through his mother possessed\r\nScythian blood.\r\n\r\n[227] The city of Athens was policed by Scythian archers.\r\n\r\n[228] Alcibiades.\r\n\r\n[229] The leather market was held at Lepros, outside the city.\r\n\r\n[230] Meaning an informer ([Greek: phain_o], to denounce).\r\n\r\n[231] According to the Athenian custom.\r\n\r\n[232] Megara was allied to Sparta and suffered during the war more than\r\nany other city, because of its proximity to Athens.\r\n\r\n[233]: Throughout this whole scene there is an obscene play upon the word\r\n[Greek: choiros], which means in Greek both 'sow' and 'a woman's organs\r\nof generation.'\r\n\r\n[234] Sacrificial victims were bound to be perfect in every part; an\r\nanimal, therefore, without a tail could not be offered.\r\n\r\n[235] The Greek word, [Greek: erebinthos], also means the male sexual\r\norgan. Observe the little pig-girl greets this question with _three_\r\naffirmative squeaks!\r\n\r\n[236] The Megarians used the Doric dialect.\r\n\r\n[237] A play upon the word [Greek: phainein], which both means _to light_\r\nand _to denounce_.\r\n\r\n[238] An informer (sycophant), otherwise unknown.\r\n\r\n[239] A debauchee of vile habits; a pathic.\r\n\r\n[240] Mentioned above; he was as proud as he was cowardly.\r\n\r\n[241] An Athenian general, quarrelsome and litigious, and an Informer\r\ninto the bargain.\r\n\r\n[242] A comic poet of vile habits.\r\n\r\n[243] A painter.\r\n\r\n[244] A debauchee, a gambler, and always in extreme poverty.\r\n\r\n[245] This kind of flute had a bellows, made of dog-skin, much like the\r\nbagpipes of to-day.\r\n\r\n[246] A flute-player, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[247] A hero, much honoured in Thebes; nephew of Heracles.\r\n\r\n[248] A form of bread peculiar to Boeotia.\r\n\r\n[249] A lake in Boeotia.\r\n\r\n[250] He was the Lucullus of Athens.\r\n\r\n[251] This again fixes the date of the presentation of the 'Acharnians'\r\nto 426 B.C., the sixth year of the War, since the beginning of which\r\nBoeotia had been closed to the Athenians.\r\n\r\n[252] An Informer.\r\n\r\n[253] The second day of the Dionysia or feasts of Bacchus, kept in the\r\nmonth Anthesterion (February), and called the Anthesteria. They lasted\r\nthree days; the second being the Feast of Cups, a description of which is\r\nto be found at the end of this comedy, the third the Feast of Pans.\r\nVases, filled with grain of all kinds, were borne in procession and\r\ndedicated to Hermes.\r\n\r\n[254] A parody of some verses from a lost poet.\r\n\r\n[255] A feasting song in honour of Harmodius, the assassin of Hipparchus\r\nthe Tyrant, son of Pisistratus.\r\n\r\n[256] The celebrated painter, born at Heraclea, a contemporary of\r\nAristophanes.\r\n\r\n[257] A deme and frontier fortress of Attica, near the Boeotian border.\r\n\r\n[258] An Athenian physician of the day.\r\n\r\n[259] An allusion to the paroxysms of rage, as represented in many\r\ntragedies familiar to an Athenian audience, of Orestes, the son of\r\nAgamemnon, after he had killed his mother.\r\n\r\n[260] No doubt the comic poet, rival of Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n[261] Unexpected wind-up of the story. Aristophanes intends to deride the\r\nboasting of Lamachus, who was always ascribing to himself most unlikely\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe 'Peace' was brought out four years after 'The Acharnians' (422 B.C.),\r\nwhen the War had already lasted ten years. The leading motive is the same\r\nas in the former play--the intense desire of the less excitable and more\r\nmoderate-minded citizens for relief from the miseries of war.\r\n\r\nTrygaeus, a rustic patriot, finding no help in men, resolves to ascend to\r\nheaven to expostulate personally with Zeus for allowing this wretched\r\nstate of things to continue. With this object he has fed and trained a\r\ngigantic dung-beetle, which he mounts, and is carried, like Bellerophon\r\non Pegasus, on an aerial journey. Eventually he reaches Olympus, only to\r\nfind that the gods have gone elsewhere, and that the heavenly abode is\r\noccupied solely by the demon of War, who is busy pounding up the Greek\r\nStates in a huge mortar. However, his benevolent purpose is not in vain;\r\nfor learning from Hermes that the goddess Peace has been cast into a pit,\r\nwhere she is kept a fast prisoner, he calls upon the different peoples of\r\nHellas to make a united effort and rescue her, and with their help drags\r\nher out and brings her back in triumph to earth. The play concludes with\r\nthe restoration of the goddess to her ancient honours, the festivities of\r\nthe rustic population and the nuptials of Trygaeus with Opora (Harvest),\r\nhandmaiden of Peace, represented as a pretty courtesan.\r\n\r\nSuch references as there are to Cleon in this play are noteworthy. The\r\ngreat Demagogue was now dead, having fallen in the same action as the\r\nrival Spartan general, the renowned Brasidas, before Amphipolis, and\r\nwhatever Aristophanes says here of his old enemy is conceived in the\r\nspirit of 'de mortuis nil nisi bonum.' In one scene Hermes is descanting\r\non the evils which had nearly ruined Athens and declares that 'The\r\nTanner' was the cause of them all. But Trygaeus interrupts him with the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  \"Hold--say not so, good master Hermes;\r\n  Let the man rest in peace where now he lies.\r\n  He is no longer of our world, but yours.\"\r\n\r\nHere surely we have a trait of magnanimity on the author's part as\r\nadmirable in its way as the wit and boldness of his former attacks had\r\nbeen in theirs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS.\r\nTWO SERVANTS of TRYGAEUS.\r\nMAIDENS, Daughters of TRYGAEUS.\r\nHERMES.\r\nWAR.\r\nTUMULT.\r\nHIEROCLES, a Soothsayer.\r\nA SICKLE-MAKER.\r\nA CREST-MAKER.\r\nA TRUMPET-MAKER.\r\nA HELMET-MAKER.\r\nA SPEAR-MAKER.\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS.\r\nSON OF CLEONYMUS.\r\nCHORUS OF HUSBANDMEN.\r\n\r\nSCENE: A farmyard, two slaves busy beside a dungheap; afterwards, in\r\nOlympus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Quick, quick, bring the dung-beetle his cake.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Coming, coming.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Give it to him, and may it kill him!\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. May he never eat a better.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Now give him this other one kneaded up with ass's dung.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. There! I've done that too.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. And where's what you gave him just now; surely he can't\r\nhave devoured it yet!\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Indeed he has; he snatched it, rolled it between his feet\r\nand boiled it.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Come, hurry up, knead up a lot and knead them stiffly.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Oh, scavengers, help me in the name of the gods, if you\r\ndo not wish to see me fall down choked.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Come, come, another made of the stool of a young\r\nscapegrace catamite. 'Twill be to the beetle's taste; he likes it well\r\nground.[262]\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. There! I am free at least from suspicion; none will\r\naccuse me of tasting what I mix.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Faugh! come, now another! keep on mixing with all your\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. I' faith, no. I can stand this awful cesspool stench no\r\nlonger, so I bring you the whole ill-smelling gear.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Pitch it down the sewer sooner, and yourself with it.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Maybe, one of you can tell me where I can buy a\r\nstopped-up nose, for there is no work more disgusting than to mix food\r\nfor a beetle and to carry it to him. A pig or a dog will at least pounce\r\nupon our excrement without more ado, but this foul wretch affects the\r\ndisdainful, the spoilt mistress, and won't eat unless I offer him a cake\r\nthat has been kneaded for an entire day.... But let us open the door a\r\nbit ajar without his seeing it. Has he done eating? Come, pluck up\r\ncourage, cram yourself till you burst! The cursed creature! It wallows in\r\nits food! It grips it between its claws like a wrestler clutching his\r\nopponent, and with head and feet together rolls up its paste like a\r\nropemaker twisting a hawser. What an indecent, stinking, gluttonous\r\nbeast! I know not what angry god let this monster loose upon us, but of a\r\ncertainty it was neither Aphrodité nor the Graces.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Who was it then?\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. No doubt the Thunderer, Zeus.\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. But perhaps some spectator, some beardless youth, who\r\nthinks himself a sage, will say, \"What is this? What does the beetle\r\nmean?\" And then an Ionian,[263] sitting next him, will add, \"I think 'tis\r\nan allusion to Cleon, who so shamelessly feeds on filth all by\r\nhimself.\"--But now I'm going indoors to fetch the beetle a drink.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. As for me, I will explain the matter to you all,\r\nchildren, youths, grown-ups and old men, aye, even to the decrepit\r\ndotards. My master is mad, not as you are, but with another sort of\r\nmadness, quite a new kind. The livelong day he looks open-mouthed towards\r\nheaven and never stops addressing Zeus. \"Ah! Zeus,\" he cries, \"what are\r\nthy intentions? Lay aside thy besom; do not sweep Greece away!\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! ah! ah!\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. Hush, hush! Methinks I hear his voice!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Zeus, what art thou going to do for our people? Dost thou\r\nnot see this, that our cities will soon be but empty husks?\r\n\r\nFIRST SLAVE. As I told you, that is his form of madness. There you have a\r\nsample of his follies. When his trouble first began to seize him, he said\r\nto himself, \"By what means could I go straight to Zeus?\" Then he made\r\nhimself very slender little ladders and so clambered up towards heaven;\r\nbut he soon came hurtling down again and broke his head. Yesterday, to\r\nour misfortune, he went out and brought us back this thoroughbred, but\r\nfrom where I know not, this great beetle, whose groom he has forced me to\r\nbecome. He himself caresses it as though it were a horse, saying, \"Oh! my\r\nlittle Pegasus,[264] my noble aerial steed, may your wings soon bear me\r\nstraight to Zeus!\" But what is my master doing? I must stoop down to look\r\nthrough this hole. Oh! great gods! Here! neighbours, run here quick! here\r\nis my master flying off mounted on his beetle as if on horseback.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Gently, gently, go easy, beetle; don't start off so proudly, or\r\ntrust at first too greatly to your powers; wait till you have sweated,\r\ntill the beating of your wings shall make your limb joints supple. Above\r\nall things, don't let off some foul smell, I adjure you; else I would\r\nrather have you stop in the stable altogether.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Poor master! Is he crazy?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Silence! silence!\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT (_to Trygaeus_). But why start up into the air on chance?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis for the weal of all the Greeks; I am attempting a daring\r\nand novel feat.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. But what is your purpose? What useless folly!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No words of ill omen! Give vent to joy and command all men to\r\nkeep silence, to close down their drains and privies with new tiles and\r\nto stop their own vent-holes.[265]\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. No, I shall not be silent, unless you tell me where you\r\nare going.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why, where am I likely to be going across the sky, if it be not\r\nto visit Zeus?\r\n\r\nFIRST SERVANT. For what purpose?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I want to ask him what he reckons to do for all the Greeks.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. And if he doesn't tell you?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I shall pursue him at law as a traitor who sells Greece to the\r\nMedes.[266]\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Death seize me, if I let you go.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. It is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nSECOND SERVANT. Alas! alas! dear little girls, your father is deserting\r\nyou secretly to go to heaven. Ah! poor orphans, entreat him, beseech him.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Father! father! what is this I hear? Is it true? What!\r\nyou would leave me, you would vanish into the sky, you would go to the\r\ncrows?[267] 'Tis impossible! Answer, father, an you love me.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, I am going. You hurt me too sorely, my daughters, when you\r\nask me for bread, calling me your daddy, and there is not the ghost of an\r\nobolus in the house; if I succeed and come back, you will have a barley\r\nloaf every morning--and a punch in the eye for sauce!\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. But how will you make the journey? 'Tis not a ship that\r\nwill carry you thither.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, but this winged steed will.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. But what an idea, daddy, to harness a beetle, on which\r\nto fly to the gods.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. We see from Aesop's fables that they alone can fly to the abode\r\nof the Immortals.[268]\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Father, father, 'tis a tale nobody can believe! that\r\nsuch a stinking creature can have gone to the gods.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. It went to have vengeance on the eagle and break its eggs.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Why not saddle Pegasus? you would have a more\r\n_tragic_[269] appearance in the eyes of the gods.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Eh! don't you see, little fool, that then twice the food would\r\nbe wanted? Whereas my beetle devours again as filth what I have eaten\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. And if it fell into the watery depths of the sea, could\r\nit escape with its wings?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS (_showing his penis_). I am fitted with a rudder in case of\r\nneed, and my Naxos beetle will serve me as a boat.[270]\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. And what harbour will you put in at?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why, is there not the harbour of Cantharos at the Piraeus?[271]\r\n\r\nLITTLE DAUGHTER. Take care not to knock against anything and so fall off\r\ninto space; once a cripple, you would be a fit subject for Euripides, who\r\nwould put you into a tragedy.[272]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I'll see to it. Good-bye! (_To the Athenians._) You, for love\r\nof whom I brave these dangers, do ye neither let wind nor go to stool for\r\nthe space of three days, for, if, while cleaving the air, my steed should\r\nscent anything, he would fling me head foremost from the summit of my\r\nhopes. Now come, my Pegasus, get a-going with up-pricked ears and make\r\nyour golden bridle resound gaily. Eh! what are you doing? What are you up\r\nto? Do you turn your nose towards the cesspools? Come, pluck up a spirit;\r\nrush upwards from the earth, stretch out your speedy wings and make\r\nstraight for the palace of Zeus; for once give up foraging in your daily\r\nfood.--Hi! you down there, what are you after now? Oh! my god! 'tis a man\r\nemptying his belly in the Piraeus, close to the house where the bad girls\r\nare. But is it my death you seek then, my death? Will you not bury that\r\nright away and pile a great heap of earth upon it and plant wild thyme\r\ntherein and pour perfumes on it? If I were to fall from up here and\r\nmisfortune happened to me, the town of Chios[273]would owe a fine of five\r\ntalents for my death, all along of your cursed rump. Alas! how frightened\r\nI am! oh! I have no heart for jests. Ah! machinist, take great care of\r\nme. There is already a wind whirling round my navel; take great care or,\r\nfrom sheer fright, I shall form food for my beetle.... But I think I am\r\nno longer far from the gods; aye, that is the dwelling of Zeus, I\r\nperceive. Hullo! Hi! where is the doorkeeper? Will no one open?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The scene changes and heaven is presented._\r\n\r\nHERMES. Meseems I can sniff a man. (_He perceives Trygaeus astride his\r\nbeetle._) Why, what plague is this?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. A horse-beetle.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! impudent, shameless rascal! oh! scoundrel! triple scoundrel!\r\nthe greatest scoundrel in the world! how did you come here? Oh! scoundrel\r\nof all scoundrels! your name? Reply.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Triple scoundrel.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Your country?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Triple scoundrel.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Your father?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. My father? Triple scoundrel.\r\n\r\nHERMES. By the Earth, you shall die, unless you tell me your name.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I am Trygaeus of the Athmonian deme, a good vine-dresser,\r\nlittle addicted to quibbling and not at all an informer.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Why do you come?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I come to bring you this meat.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Ah! my good friend, did you have a good journey?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Glutton, be off! I no longer seem a triple scoundrel to you.\r\nCome, call Zeus.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Ah! ah! you are a long way yet from reaching the gods, for they\r\nmoved yesterday.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. To what part of the earth?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Eh! of the earth, did you say?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. In short, where are they then?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Very far, very far, right at the furthest end of the dome of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But why have they left you all alone here?\r\n\r\nHERMES. I am watching what remains of the furniture, the little pots and\r\npans, the bits of chairs and tables, and odd wine-jars.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And why have the gods moved away?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Because of their wrath against the Greeks. They have located War\r\nin the house they occupied themselves and have given him full power to do\r\nwith you exactly as he pleases; then they went as high up as ever they\r\ncould, so as to see no more of your fights and to hear no more of your\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What reason have they for treating us so?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Because they have afforded you an opportunity for peace more than\r\nonce, but you have always preferred war. If the Laconians got the very\r\nslightest advantage, they would exclaim, \"By the Twin Brethren! the\r\nAthenians shall smart for this.\" If, on the contrary, the latter\r\ntriumphed and the Laconians came with peace proposals, you would say, \"By\r\nDemeter, they want to deceive us. No, by Zeus, we will not hear a word;\r\nthey will always be coming as long as we hold Pylos.\"[274]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, that is quite the style our folk do talk in.\r\n\r\nHERMES. So that I don't know whether you will ever see Peace again.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why, where has she gone to then?\r\n\r\nHERMES. War has cast her into a deep pit.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Where?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Down there, at the very bottom. And you see what heaps of stones\r\nhe has piled over the top, so that you should never pull her out again.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Tell me, what is War preparing against us?\r\n\r\nHERMES. All I know is that last evening he brought along a huge mortar.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And what is he going to do with his mortar?\r\n\r\nHERMES. He wants to pound up all the cities of Greece in it.... But I\r\nmust say good-bye, for I think he is coming out; what an uproar he is\r\nmaking!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! great gods! let us seek safety; meseems I already hear the\r\nnoise of this fearful war mortar.\r\n\r\nWAR (_enters carrying a mortar_). Oh! mortals, mortals, wretched mortals,\r\nhow your jaws will snap!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! divine Apollo! what a prodigious big mortar! Oh, what\r\nmisery the very sight of War causes me! This then is the foe from whom I\r\nfly, who is so cruel, so formidable, so stalwart, so solid on his legs!\r\n\r\nWAR. Oh! Prasiae![275] thrice wretched, five times, aye, a thousand times\r\nwretched! for thou shalt be destroyed this day.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. This does not yet concern us over much; 'tis only so much the\r\nworse for the Laconians.\r\n\r\nWAR. Oh! Megara! Megara! how utterly are you going to be ground up! what\r\nfine mincemeat[276] are you to be made into!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Alas! alas! what bitter tears there will be among the\r\nMegarians![277]\r\n\r\nWAR. Oh, Sicily! you too must perish! Your wretched towns shall be grated\r\nlike this cheese.[278] Now let us pour some Attic honey[279] into the\r\nmortar.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! I beseech you! use some other honey; this kind is worth\r\nfour obols; be careful, oh! be careful of our Attic honey.\r\n\r\nWAR. Hi! Tumult, you slave there!\r\n\r\nTUMULT. What do you want?\r\n\r\nWAR. Out upon you! You stand there with folded arms. Take this cuff o'\r\nthe head for your pains.\r\n\r\nTUMULT. Oh! how it stings! Master, have you got garlic in your fist, I\r\nwonder?\r\n\r\nWAR. Run and fetch me a pestle.\r\n\r\nTUMULT. But we haven't got one; 'twas only yesterday we moved.\r\n\r\nWAR. Go and fetch me one from Athens, and hurry, hurry!\r\n\r\nTUMULT. Aye, I hasten there; if I return without one, I shall have no\r\ncause for laughing. [_Exit._\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! what is to become of us, wretched mortals that we are? See\r\nthe danger that threatens if he returns with the pestle, for War will\r\nquietly amuse himself with pounding all the towns of Hellas to pieces.\r\nAh! Bacchus! cause this herald of evil to perish on his road!\r\n\r\nWAR. Well!\r\n\r\nTUMULT (_who has returned_). Well, what?\r\n\r\nWAR. You have brought back nothing?\r\n\r\nTUMULT. Alas! the Athenians have lost their pestle--the tanner, who\r\nground Greece to powder.[280]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Athené, venerable mistress! 'tis well for our city he is\r\ndead, and before he could serve us with this hash.\r\n\r\nWAR. Then go and seek one at Sparta and have done with it!\r\n\r\nTUMULT. Aye, aye, master!\r\n\r\nWAR. Be back as quick as ever you can.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS (_to the audience_). What is going to happen, friends? 'Tis a\r\ncritical hour. Ah! if there is some initiate of Samothrace[281] among\r\nyou, 'tis surely the moment to wish this messenger some accident--some\r\nsprain or strain.\r\n\r\nTUMULT (_who returns_). Alas! alas! thrice again, alas!\r\n\r\nWAR. What is it? Again you come back without it?\r\n\r\nTUMULT. The Spartans too have lost their pestle.\r\n\r\nWAR. How, varlet?\r\n\r\nTUMULT. They had lent it to their allies in Thrace,[282] who have lost it\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Long life to you, Thracians! My hopes revive, pluck up courage,\r\nmortals!\r\n\r\nWAR. Take all this stuff away; I am going in to make a pestle for myself.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis now the time to sing as Datis did, as he masturbated\r\nhimself at high noon, \"Oh pleasure! oh enjoyment! oh delights!\" 'Tis now,\r\noh Greeks! the moment when freed of quarrels and fighting, we should\r\nrescue sweet Peace and draw her out of this pit, before some other pestle\r\nprevents us. Come, labourers, merchants, workmen, artisans, strangers,\r\nwhether you be domiciled or not, islanders, come here, Greeks of all\r\ncountries, come hurrying here with picks and levers and ropes! 'Tis the\r\nmoment to drain a cup in honour of the Good Genius.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come hither, all! quick, quick, hasten to the rescue! All peoples\r\nof Greece, now is the time or never, for you to help each other. You see\r\nyourselves freed from battles and all their horrors of bloodshed. The\r\nday, hateful to Lamachus,[283] has come. Come then, what must be done?\r\nGive your orders, direct us, for I swear to work this day without\r\nceasing, until with the help of our levers and our engines we have drawn\r\nback into light the greatest of all goddesses, her to whom the olive is\r\nso dear.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Silence! if War should hear your shouts of joy he would bound\r\nforth from his retreat in fury.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Such a decree overwhelms us with joy; how different to the edict,\r\nwhich bade us muster with provisions for three days.[284]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us beware lest the cursed Cerberus[285] prevent us even\r\nfrom the nethermost hell from delivering the goddess by his furious\r\nhowling, just as he did when on earth.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Once we have hold of her, none in the world will be able to take\r\nher from us. Huzza! huzza![286]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You will work my death if you don't subdue your shouts. War\r\nwill come running out and trample everything beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well then! _Let_ him confound, let him trample, let him overturn\r\neverything! We cannot help giving vent to our joy.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! cruel fate! My friends! in the name of the gods, what\r\npossesses you? Your dancing will wreck the success of a fine undertaking.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. 'Tis not I who want to dance; 'tis my legs that bound with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Enough, an you love me, cease your gambols.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. There! Tis over.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You say so, and nevertheless you go on.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Yet one more figure and 'tis done.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Well, just this one; then you must dance no more.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. No, no more dancing, if we can help you.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But look, you are not stopping even now.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. By Zeus, I am only throwing up my right leg, that's all.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, I grant you that, but pray, annoy me no further.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Ah! the left leg too will have its fling; well, 'tis but its\r\nright. I am so happy, so delighted at not having to carry my buckler any\r\nmore. I sing and I laugh more than if I had cast my old age, as a serpent\r\ndoes its skin.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, 'tis no time for joy yet, for you are not sure of success.\r\nBut when you have got the goddess, then rejoice, shout and laugh;\r\nthenceforward you will be able to sail or stay at home, to make love or\r\nsleep, to attend festivals and processions, to play at cottabos,[287]\r\nlive like true Sybarites and to shout, Io, io!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Ah! God grant we may see the blessed day. I have suffered so\r\nmuch; have so oft slept with Phormio[288] on hard beds. You will no\r\nlonger find me an acid, angry, hard judge as heretofore, but will find me\r\nturned indulgent and grown younger by twenty years through happiness. We\r\nhave been killing ourselves long enough, tiring ourselves out with going\r\nto the Lyceum[289] and returning laden with spear and buckler.--But what\r\ncan we do to please you? Come, speak; for 'tis a good Fate, that has\r\nnamed you our leader.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. How shall we set about removing these stones?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Rash reprobate, what do you propose doing?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Nothing bad, as Cillicon said.[290]\r\n\r\n\r\nHERMES. You are undone, you wretch.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, if the lot had to decide my life, for Hermes would know\r\nhow to turn the chance.[291]\r\n\r\nHERMES. You are lost, you are dead.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. On what day?\r\n\r\nHERMES. This instant.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But I have not provided myself with flour and cheese yet[292]\r\nto start for death.\r\n\r\nHERMES. You _are_ kneaded and ground already, I tell you.[293]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Hah! I have not yet tasted that gentle pleasure.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Don't you know that Zeus has decreed death for him who is\r\nsurprised exhuming Peace?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What! must I really and truly die?\r\n\r\nHERMES. You must.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Well then, lend me three drachmae to buy a young pig; I wish to\r\nhave myself initiated before I die.[294]\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! Zeus, the Thunderer![295]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I adjure you in the name of the gods, master, don't denounce\r\nus!\r\n\r\nHERMES. I may not, I cannot keep silent.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. In the name of the meats which I brought you so good-naturedly.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Why, wretched man, Zeus will annihilate me, if I do not shout out\r\nat the top of my voice, to inform him what you are plotting.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, no! don't shout, I beg you, dear little Hermes.... And what\r\nare you doing, comrades? You stand there as though you were stocks and\r\nstones. Wretched men, speak, entreat him at once; otherwise he will be\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! mighty Hermes! don't do it; no, don't do it! If ever you have\r\neaten some young pig, sacrificed by us on your altars, with pleasure, may\r\nthis offering not be without value in your sight to-day.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Do you not hear them wheedling you, mighty god?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Be not pitiless toward our prayers; permit us to deliver the\r\ngoddess. Oh! the most human, the most generous of the gods, be favourable\r\ntoward us, if it be true that you detest the haughty crests and proud\r\nbrows of Pisander;[296] we shall never cease, oh master, offering you\r\nsacred victims and solemn prayers.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Have mercy, mercy, let yourself be touched by their words;\r\nnever was your worship so dear to them as to-day.\r\n\r\nHERMES. I' truth, never have you been greater thieves.[297]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I will reveal a great, a terrible conspiracy against the gods\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Hah! speak and perchance I shall let myself be softened.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Know then, that the Moon and that infamous Sun are plotting\r\nagainst you, and want to deliver Greece into the hands of the Barbarians.\r\n\r\nHERMES. What for?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Because it is to you that we sacrifice, whereas the barbarians\r\nworship them; hence they would like to see you destroyed, that they alone\r\nmight receive the offerings.\r\n\r\nHERMES. 'Tis then for this reason that these untrustworthy charioteers\r\nhave for so long been defrauding us, one of them robbing us of daylight\r\nand the other nibbling away at the other's disk.[298]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, certainly. So therefore, Hermes, my friend, help us with\r\nyour whole heart to find and deliver the captive and we will celebrate\r\nthe great Panathenaea[299] in your honour as well as all the festivals of\r\nthe other gods; for Hermes shall be the Mysteries, the Dipolia, the\r\nAdonia; everywhere the towns, freed from their miseries, will sacrifice\r\nto Hermes, the Liberator; you will be loaded with benefits of every kind,\r\nand to start with, I offer you this cup for libations as your first\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Ah! how golden cups do influence me! Come, friends, get to work.\r\nTo the pit quickly, pick in hand and drag away the stones.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. We go, but you, the cleverest of all the gods, supervise our\r\nlabours; tell us, good workman as you are, what we must do; we shall obey\r\nyour orders with alacrity.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Quick, reach me your cup, and let us preface our work by\r\naddressing prayers to the gods.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! sacred, sacred libations! Keep silence, oh! ye people! keep\r\nsilence!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us offer our libations and our prayers, so that this day\r\nmay begin an era of unalloyed happiness for Greece and that he who has\r\nbravely pulled at the rope with us may never resume his buckler.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Aye, may we pass our lives in peace, caressing our mistresses and\r\npoking the fire.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. May he who would prefer the war, oh Dionysus, be ever drawing\r\nbarbed arrows out of his elbows.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. If there be a citizen, greedy for military rank and honours, who\r\nrefuses, oh, divine Peace! to restore you to daylight, may he behave as\r\ncowardly as Cleonymus on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. If a lance-maker or a dealer in shields desires war for the\r\nsake of better trade, may he be taken by pirates and eat nothing but\r\nbarley.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. If some ambitious man does not help us, because he wants to\r\nbecome a General, or if a slave is plotting to pass over to the enemy,\r\nlet his limbs be broken on the wheel, may he be beaten to death with\r\nrods! As for us, may Fortune favour us! Io! Paean, Io!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Don't say Paean,[300] but simply, Io.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Very well, then! Io! Io! I'll simply say, Io!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. To Hermes, the Graces, Hora, Aphrodité, Eros!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. And not to Ares?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Nor doubtless to Enyalius?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, all strain at the ropes to tear away the stones. Pull!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, pull harder, harder.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Still harder, harder still.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave, heave, oh!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, come, there is no working together. Come! all pull at the\r\nsame instant! you Boeotians are only pretending. Beware!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Come, heave away, heave!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hi! you two pull as well.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why, I am pulling, I am hanging on to the rope and straining\r\ntill I am almost off my feet; I am working with all my might.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Why does not the work advance then?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Lamachus, this is too bad! You are in the way, sitting there.\r\nWe have no use for your Medusa's head, friend.[301]\r\n\r\nHERMES. But hold, the Argives have not pulled the least bit; they have\r\ndone nothing but laugh at us for our pains while they were getting gain\r\nwith both hands.[302]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! my dear sir, the Laconians at all events pull with vigour.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. But look! only those among them who generally hold the\r\nplough-tail show any zeal,[303] while the armourers impede them in their\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nHERMES. And the Megarians too are doing nothing, yet look how they are\r\npulling and showing their teeth like famished curs; the poor wretches are\r\ndying of hunger![304]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. This won't do, friends. Come! all together! Everyone to the\r\nwork and with a good heart for the business.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Harder!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come on then, by heaven.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. This will never do.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Is it not a shame? some pull one way and others another. You,\r\nArgives there, beware of a thrashing!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Come, put your strength into it.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Heave away, heave!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. There are many ill-disposed folk among us.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Do you at least, who long for peace, pull heartily.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. But there are some who prevent us.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Off to the Devil with you, Megarians! The goddess hates you. She\r\nrecollects that you were the first to rub her the wrong way. Athenians,\r\nyou are not well placed for pulling. There you are too busy with\r\nlaw-suits; if you really want to free the goddess, get down a little\r\ntowards the sea.[305]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, friends, none but husbandmen on the rope.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Ah! that will do ever so much better.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. He says the thing is going well. Come, all of you, together and\r\nwith a will.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis the husbandmen who are doing all the work.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come then, come, and all together! Hah! hah! at last there is\r\nsome unanimity in the work. Don't let us give up, let us redouble our\r\nefforts. There! now we have it! Come then, all together! Heave away,\r\nheave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave away, heave! Heave\r\naway, heave! All together! (_Peace is drawn out of the pit._)\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! venerated goddess, who givest us our grapes, where am I to\r\nfind the ten-thousand-gallon words[306] wherewith to greet thee? I have\r\nnone such at home. Oh! hail to thee, Opora,[307] and thou, Theoria![308]\r\nHow beautiful is thy face! How sweet thy breath! What gentle fragrance\r\ncomes from thy bosom, gentle as freedom from military duty, as the most\r\ndainty perfumes!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Is it then a smell like a soldier's knapsack?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! hateful soldier! your hideous satchel makes me sick! it\r\nstinks like the belching of onions, whereas this lovable deity has the\r\nodour of sweet fruits, of festivals, of the Dionysia, of the harmony of\r\nflutes, of the comic poets, of the verses of Sophocles, of the phrases of\r\nEuripides...\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. That's a foul calumny, you wretch! She detests that framer of\r\nsubtleties and quibbles.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. ... of ivy, of straining-bags for wine, of bleating ewes, of\r\nprovision-laden women hastening to the kitchen, of the tipsy servant\r\nwench, of the upturned wine-jar, and of a whole heap of other good\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Then look how the reconciled towns chat pleasantly together, how\r\nthey laugh; and yet they are all cruelly mishandled; their wounds are\r\nbleeding still.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But let us also scan the mien of the spectators; we shall thus\r\nfind out the trade of each.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Ah! good gods! look at that poor crest-maker, tearing at his\r\nhair,[309] and at that pike-maker, who has just broken wind in yon\r\nsword-cutler's face.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And do you see with what pleasure this sickle-maker is making\r\nlong noses at the spear-maker?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Now ask the husbandmen to be off.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Listen, good folk! Let the husbandmen take their farming tools\r\nand return to their fields as quick as possible, but without either\r\nsword, spear or javelin. All is as quiet as if Peace had been reigning\r\nfor a century. Come, let everyone go till the earth, singing the Paean.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh, thou, whom men of standing desired and who art good to\r\nhusbandmen, I have gazed upon thee with delight; and now I go to greet my\r\nvines, to caress after so long an absence the fig trees I planted in my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Friends, let us first adore the goddess, who has delivered us\r\nfrom crests and Gorgons;[310] then let us hurry to our farms, having\r\nfirst bought a nice little piece of salt fish to eat in the fields.\r\n\r\nHERMES. By Posidon! what a fine crew they make and dense as the crust of\r\na cake; they are as nimble as guests on their way to a feast.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. See, how their iron spades glitter and how beautifully their\r\nthree-pronged mattocks glisten in the sun! How regularly they will align\r\nthe plants! I also burn myself to go into the country and to turn over\r\nthe earth I have so long neglected.--Friends, do you remember the happy\r\nlife that peace afforded us formerly; can you recall the splendid baskets\r\nof figs, both fresh and dried, the myrtles, the sweet wine, the violets\r\nblooming near the spring, and the olives, for which we have wept so much?\r\nWorship, adore the goddess for restoring you so many blessings.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hail! hail! thou beloved divinity! thy return overwhelms us with\r\njoy. When far from thee, my ardent wish to see my fields again made me\r\npine with regret. From thee came all blessings. Oh! much desired Peace!\r\nthou art the sole support of those who spend their lives tilling the\r\nearth. Under thy rule we had a thousand delicious enjoyments at our beck;\r\nthou wert the husbandman's wheaten cake and his safeguard. So that our\r\nvineyards, our young fig-tree woods and all our plantations hail thee\r\nwith delight and smile at thy coming. But where was she then, I wonder,\r\nall the long time she spent away from us? Hermes, thou benevolent god,\r\ntell us!\r\n\r\nHERMES. Wise husbandmen, hearken to my words, if you want to know why she\r\nwas lost to you. The start of our misfortunes was the exile of\r\nPhidias;[311] Pericles feared he might share his ill-luck, he mistrusted\r\nyour peevish nature and, to prevent all danger to himself, he threw out\r\nthat little spark, the Megarian decree,[312] set the city aflame, and\r\nblew up the conflagration with a hurricane of war, so that the smoke drew\r\ntears from all Greeks both here and over there. At the very outset of\r\nthis fire our vines were a-crackle, our casks knocked together;[313] it\r\nwas beyond the power of any man to stop the disaster, and Peace\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. That, by Apollo! is what no one ever told me; I could not think\r\nwhat connection there could be between Phidias and Peace.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Nor I; I know it now. This accounts for her beauty, if she is\r\nrelated to him. There are so many things that escape us.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Then, when the towns subject to you saw that you were angered one\r\nagainst the other and were showing each other your teeth like dogs, they\r\nhatched a thousand plots to pay you no more dues and gained over the\r\nchief citizens of Sparta at the price of gold. They, being as shamelessly\r\ngreedy as they were faithless in diplomacy, chased off Peace with\r\nignominy to let loose War. Though this was profitable to them, 'twas the\r\nruin of the husbandmen, who were innocent of all blame; for, in revenge,\r\nyour galleys went out to devour their figs.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And 'twas with justice too; did they not break down my black\r\nfig tree, which I had planted and dunged with my own hands?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Yes, by Zeus! yes, 'twas well done; the wretches broke a chest\r\nfor me with stones, which held six medimni of corn.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Then the rural labourers flocked into the city[314] and let\r\nthemselves be bought over like the others. Not having even a grape-stone\r\nto munch and longing after their figs, they looked towards the\r\norators.[315] These well knew that the poor were driven to extremity and\r\nlacked even bread; but they nevertheless drove away the Goddess each time\r\nshe reappeared in answer to the wish of the country with their loud\r\nshrieks, that were as sharp as pitchforks; furthermore, they attacked the\r\nwell-filled purses of the richest among our allies on the pretence that\r\nthey belonged to Brasidas' party.[316] And then you would tear the poor\r\naccused wretch to pieces with your teeth; for the city, all pale with\r\nhunger and cowed with terror, gladly snapped up any calumny that was\r\nthrown it to devour. So the strangers, seeing what terrible blows the\r\ninformers dealt, sealed their lips with gold. They grew rich, while you,\r\nalas! you could only see that Greece was going to ruin. 'Twas the tanner\r\nwho was the author of all this woe.[317]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Enough said, Hermes, leave that man in Hades, whither he has\r\ngone; he no longer belongs to us, but rather to yourself.[318] That he\r\nwas a cheat, a braggart, a calumniator when alive, why, nothing could be\r\ntruer; but anything you might say now would be an insult to one of your\r\nown folk. Oh! venerated Goddess! why art thou silent?\r\n\r\nHERMES. And how could she speak to the spectators? She is too angry at\r\nall that they have made her suffer.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. At least let her speak a little to you, Hermes.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Tell me, my dear, what are your feelings with regard to them?\r\nCome, you relentless foe of all bucklers, speak; I am listening to you.\r\n(_Peace whispers into Hermes' ear._) Is that your grievance against them?\r\nYes, yes, I understand. Hearken, you folk, this is her complaint. She\r\nsays, that after the affair of Pylos[319] she came to you unbidden to\r\nbring you a basket full of truces and that you thrice repulsed her by\r\nyour votes in the assembly.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yes, we did wrong, but forgive us, for our mind was then\r\nentirely absorbed in leather.[320]\r\n\r\nHERMES. Listen again to what she has just asked me. Who was her greatest\r\nfoe here? and furthermore, had she a friend who exerted himself to put an\r\nend to the fighting?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Her most devoted friend was Cleonymus; it is undisputed.\r\n\r\nHERMES. How then did Cleonymus behave in fights?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! the bravest of warriors! Only he was not born of the father\r\nhe claims; he showed it quick enough in the army by throwing away his\r\nweapons.[321]\r\n\r\nHERMES. There is yet another question she has just put to me. Who rules\r\nnow in the rostrum?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis Hyperbolus, who now holds empire on the Pnyx. (_To\r\nPeace._) What now? you turn away your head!\r\n\r\nHERMES. She is vexed, that the people should give themselves a wretch of\r\nthat kind for their chief.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS Oh! we shall not employ him again; but the people, seeing\r\nthemselves without a leader, took him haphazard, just as a man, who is\r\nnaked, springs upon the first cloak he sees.\r\n\r\nHERMES. She asks, what will be the result of such a choice of the city?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. We shall be more far-seeing in consequence.\r\n\r\nHERMES. And why?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Because he is a lamp-maker. Formerly we only directed our\r\nbusiness by groping in the dark; now we shall only deliberate by\r\nlamplight.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! oh! what questions she does order me to put to you!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What are they?\r\n\r\nHERMES. She wants to have news of a whole heap of old-fashioned things\r\nshe left here. First of all, how is Sophocles?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Very well; but something very strange has happened to him.\r\n\r\nHERMES. What then?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. He has turned from Sophocles into Simonides.[322]\r\n\r\nHERMES. Into Simonides? How so?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Because, though old and broken-down as he is, he would put to\r\nsea on a hurdle to gain an obolus.[323]\r\n\r\nHERMES. And wise Cratinus, is he still alive?[324]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. He died about the time of the Laconian invasion.\r\n\r\nHERMES. How?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Of a swoon. He could not bear the shock of seeing one of his\r\ncasks full of wine broken. Ah! what a number of other misfortunes our\r\ncity has suffered! So, dearest mistress, nothing can now separate us from\r\nthee.\r\n\r\nHERMES. If that be so, receive Opora here for a wife; take her to the\r\ncountry, live with her, and grow fine grapes together.[325]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, my dear friend, come and accept my kisses. Tell me,\r\nHermes, my master, do you think it would hurt me to fuck her a little,\r\nafter so long an abstinence?\r\n\r\nHERMES. No, not if you swallow a potion of penny-royal afterwards.[326]\r\nBut hasten to lead Theoria[327] to the Senate; 'twas there she lodged\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! fortunate Senate! Thanks to Theoria, what soups you will\r\nswallow for the space of three days![328] how you will devour meats and\r\ncooked tripe! Come, farewell, friend Hermes!\r\n\r\nHERMES. And to you also, my dear sir, may you have much happiness, and\r\ndon't forget me.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, beetle, home, home, and let us fly on a swift wing.\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! he is no longer here.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Where has he gone to then?\r\n\r\nHERMES. He is harnessed to the chariot of Zeus and bears the\r\nthunderbolts.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But where will the poor wretch get his food?\r\n\r\nHERMES. He will eat Ganymede's ambrosia.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Very well then, but how am I going to descend?\r\n\r\nHERMES. Oh! never fear, there is nothing simpler; place yourself beside\r\nthe goddess.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, my pretty maidens, follow me quickly; there are plenty of\r\nfolk awaiting you with standing tools.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Farewell and good luck be yours! Let us begin by handing over all\r\nthis gear to the care of our servants, for no place is less safe than a\r\ntheatre; there is always a crowd of thieves prowling around it, seeking\r\nto find some mischief to do. Come, keep a good watch over all this. As\r\nfor ourselves, let us explain to the spectators what we have in our\r\nminds, the purpose of our play.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the comic poet who mounted the stage to praise himself in the\r\nparabasis would deserve to be handed over to the sticks of the beadles.\r\nNevertheless, oh Muse, if it be right to esteem the most honest and\r\nillustrious of our comic writers at his proper value, permit our poet to\r\nsay that he thinks he has deserved a glorious renown. First of all, 'tis\r\nhe who has compelled his rivals no longer to scoff at rags or to war with\r\nlice; and as for those Heracles, always chewing and ever hungry, those\r\npoltroons and cheats who allow themselves to be beaten at will, he was\r\nthe first to cover them with ridicule and to chase them from the\r\nstage;[329] he has also dismissed that slave, whom one never failed to\r\nset a-weeping before you, so that his comrade might have the chance of\r\njeering at his stripes and might ask, \"Wretch, what has happened to your\r\nhide? Has the lash rained an army of its thongs on you and laid your back\r\nwaste?\" After having delivered us from all these wearisome ineptitudes\r\nand these low buffooneries, he has built up for us a great art, like a\r\npalace with high towers, constructed of fine phrases, great thoughts and\r\nof jokes not common on the streets. Moreover 'tis not obscure private\r\npersons or women that he stages in his comedies; but, bold as Heracles,\r\n'tis the very greatest whom he attacks, undeterred by the fetid stink of\r\nleather or the threats of hearts of mud. He has the right to say, \"I am\r\nthe first ever dared to go straight for that beast with the sharp teeth\r\nand the terrible eyes that flashed lambent fire like those of Cynna,[330]\r\nsurrounded by a hundred lewd flatterers, who spittle-licked him to his\r\nheart's content; it had a voice like a roaring torrent, the stench of a\r\nseal, a foul Lamia's testicles and the rump of a camel.\"[331]\r\n\r\nI did not recoil in horror at the sight of such a monster, but fought him\r\nrelentlessly to win your deliverance and that of the Islanders. Such are\r\nthe services which should be graven in your recollection and entitle me\r\nto your thanks. Yet I have not been seen frequenting the wrestling school\r\nintoxicated with success and trying to tamper with young boys;[332] but I\r\ntook all my theatrical gear[333] and returned straight home. I pained\r\nfolk but little and caused them much amusement; my conscience rebuked me\r\nfor nothing. Hence both grown men and youths should be on my side and I\r\nlikewise invite the bald[334] to give me their votes; for, if I triumph,\r\neveryone will say, both at table and at festivals, \"Carry this to the\r\nbald man, give these cakes to the bald one, do not grudge the poet whose\r\ntalent shines as bright as his own bare skull the share he deserves.\"\r\n\r\nOh, Muse! drive the War far from our city and come to preside over our\r\ndances, if you love me; come and celebrate the nuptials of the gods, the\r\nbanquets of us mortals and the festivals of the fortunate; these are the\r\nthemes that inspire thy most poetic songs. And should Carcinus come to\r\nbeg thee for admission with his sons to thy chorus, refuse all traffic\r\nwith them; remember they are but gelded birds, stork-necked dancers,\r\nmannikins about as tall as a pat of goat's dung, in fact machine-made\r\npoets.[335] Contrary to all expectation, the father has at last managed\r\nto finish a piece, but he owns himself a cat strangled it one fine\r\nevening.[336]\r\n\r\nSuch are the songs[337] with which the Muse with the glorious hair\r\ninspires the able poet and which enchant the assembled populace, when the\r\nspring swallow twitters beneath the foliage;[338] but the god spare us\r\nfrom the chorus of Morsimus and that of Melanthius![339] Oh! what a\r\nbitter discordancy grated upon my ears that day when the tragic chorus\r\nwas directed by this same Melanthius and his brother, these two\r\nGorgons,[340] these two harpies, the plague of the seas, whose gluttonous\r\nbellies devour the entire race of fishes, these followers of old women,\r\nthese goats with their stinking arm-pits. Oh! Muse, spit upon them\r\nabundantly and keep the feast gaily with me.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! 'tis a rough job getting to the gods! my legs are as good\r\nas broken through it. How small you were, to be sure, when seen from\r\nheaven! you had all the appearance too of being great rascals; but seen\r\nclose, you look even worse.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Is that you, master?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. So I have been told.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. What has happened to you?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. My legs pain me; it is such a plaguey long journey.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Oh! do tell me....\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Did you see any other man besides yourself strolling about in\r\nheaven?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, only the souls of two or three dithyrambic poets.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. What were they doing up there?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. They were seeking to catch some lyric exordia as they flew by\r\nimmersed in the billows of the air.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Is it true, what they tell us, that men are turned into stars\r\nafter death?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Quite true.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Then who is that star I see over yonder?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. That is Ion of Chios,[341] the author of an ode beginning\r\n\"Morning\"; as soon as ever he got to heaven, they called him \"the Morning\r\nStar.\"\r\n\r\nSERVANT. And those stars like sparks, that plough up the air as they dart\r\nacross the sky?[342]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. They are the rich leaving the feast with a lantern and a light\r\ninside it. But hurry up, show this young girl into my house, clean out\r\nthe bath, heat some water and prepare the nuptial couch for herself and\r\nme. When 'tis done, come back here; meanwhile I am off to present this\r\none to the Senate.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. But where then did you get these pretty chattels?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Where? why in heaven.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. I would not give more than an obolus for gods who have got to\r\nkeeping brothels like us mere mortals.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. They are not all so, but there are some up there too who live\r\nby this trade.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Come, that's rich! But I bethink me, shall I give her something\r\nto eat?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, for she would neither touch bread nor cake; she is used to\r\nlicking ambrosia at the table of the gods.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Well, we can give her something to lick down here too.[343]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Here is a truly happy old man, as far as I can judge.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! but what shall I be, when you see me presently dressed for\r\nthe wedding?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Made young again by love and scented with perfumes, your lot will\r\nbe one we all shall envy.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And when I lie beside her and caress her bosoms?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! then you will be happier than those spinning-tops who call\r\nCarcinus their father.[344]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And I well deserve it; have I not bestridden a beetle to save\r\nthe Greeks, who now, thanks to me, can make love at their ease and sleep\r\npeacefully on their farms?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. The girl has quitted the bath; she is charming from head to\r\nfoot, both belly and buttocks; the cake is baked and they are kneading\r\nthe sesame-biscuit;[345] nothing is lacking but the bridegroom's penis.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us first hasten to lodge Theoria in the hands of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. But tell me, who is this woman?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why, 'tis Theoria, with whom we used formerly to go to\r\nBrauron,[346] to get tipsy and frolic. I had the greatest trouble to get\r\nhold of her.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Ah! you charmer! what pleasure your pretty bottom will afford me\r\nevery four years!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us see, who of you is steady enough to be trusted by the\r\nSenate with the care of this charming wench? Hi! you, friend! what are\r\nyou drawing there?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. I am drawing the plan of the tent I wish to erect for myself on\r\nthe isthmus.[347]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, who wishes to take the charge of her? No one? Come,\r\nTheoria, I am going to lead you into the midst of the spectators and\r\nconfide you to their care.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Ah! there is one who makes a sign to you.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Who is it?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. 'Tis Ariphrades. He wishes to take her home at once.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, I'm sure he shan't. He would soon have her done for,\r\nlicking up all her life juice.[348] Come, Theoria, put down all this\r\ngear.[349]--Senate, Prytanes, look upon Theoria and see what precious\r\nblessings I place in your hands.[350] Hasten to raise its limbs and to\r\nimmolate the victim. Admire the fine chimney,[351] it is quite black with\r\nsmoke, for 'twas here that the Senate did their cooking before the War.\r\nNow that you have found Theoria again, you can start the most charming\r\ngames from to-morrow, wrestling with her on the ground, either on your\r\nhands and feet, or you can lay her on her side, or stand before her with\r\nbent knees, or, well rubbed with oil, you can boldly enter the lists, as\r\nin the Pancratium, belabouring your foe with blows from your fist or\r\notherwise.[352] The next day you will celebrate equestrian games, in\r\nwhich the riders will ride side by side, or else the chariot teams,\r\nthrown one on top of another, panting and whinnying, will roll and knock\r\nagainst each other on the ground, while other rivals, thrown out of their\r\nseats, will fall before reaching the goal, utterly exhausted by their\r\nefforts.--Come, Prytanes, take Theoria. Oh! look how graciously yonder\r\nfellow has received her; you would not have been in such a hurry to\r\nintroduce her to the Senate, if nothing were coming to you through\r\nit;[353] you would not have failed to plead some holiday as an excuse.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Such a man as you assures the happiness of all his\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. When you are gathering your vintages you will prize me even\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. E'en from to-day we hail you as the deliverer of mankind.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Wait until you have drunk a beaker of new wine, before you\r\nappraise my true merits.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Excepting the gods, there is none greater than yourself, and that\r\nwill ever be our opinion.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Yea, Trygaeus of Athmonia has deserved well of you, he has\r\nfreed both husbandman and craftsman from the most cruel ills; he has\r\nvanquished Hyperbolus.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Well then, what must we do now?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You must offer pots of green-stuff to the goddess to consecrate\r\nher altars.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Pots of green-stuff[354] as we do to poor Hermes--and even he\r\nthinks the fare but mean?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What will you offer then? A fatted bull?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh, no! I don't want to start bellowing the battle-cry.[355]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. A great fat swine then?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. No, no.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why not?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. We don't want any of the swinishness of Theagenes.[356]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What other victim do you prefer then?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. A sheep.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. A sheep?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Yes.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But you must give the word the Ionic form.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Purposely. So that if anyone in the assembly says, \"We must go to\r\nwar,\" all may start bleating in alarm, \"Oï, oï.\"[357]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. A brilliant idea.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. And we shall all be lambs one toward the other, yea, and milder\r\nstill toward the allies.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Then go for the sheep and haste to bring it back with you; I\r\nwill prepare the altar for the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. How everything succeeds to our wish, when the gods are willing\r\nand Fortune favours us! how opportunely everything falls out.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Nothing could be truer, for look! here stands the altar all\r\nready at my door.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hurry, hurry, for the winds are fickle; make haste, while the\r\ndivine will is set on stopping this cruel war and is showering on us the\r\nmost striking benefits.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Here is the basket of barley-seed mingled with salt, the\r\nchaplet and the sacred knife; and there is the fire; so we are only\r\nwaiting for the sheep.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hasten, hasten, for, if Chaeris sees you, he will come without\r\nbidding, he and his flute; and when you see him puffing and panting and\r\nout of breath, you will have to give him something.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, seize the basket and take the lustral water and hurry to\r\ncircle round the altar to the right.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. There! 'tis done. What is your next bidding?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Hold! I take this fire-brand first and plunge it into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Be quick! be quick! Sprinkle the altar.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Give me some barley-seed, purify yourself and hand me the\r\nbasin; then scatter the rest of the barley among the audience.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. 'Tis done.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You have thrown it?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Yes, by Hermes! and all the spectators have had their share.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. But not the women?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Oh! their husbands will give it them this evening.[358]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us pray! Who is here? Are there any good men?[359]\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Come, give, so that I may sprinkle these. Faith! they are indeed\r\ngood, brave men.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You believe so?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. I am sure, and the proof of it is that we have flooded them with\r\nlustral water and they have not budged an inch.[360]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come then, to prayers; to prayers, quick!--Oh! Peace, mighty\r\nqueen, venerated goddess, thou, who presidest over choruses and at\r\nnuptials, deign to accept the sacrifices we offer thee.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Receive it, greatly honoured mistress, and behave not like the\r\ncoquettes, who half open the door to entice the gallants, draw back when\r\nthey are stared at, to return once more if a man passes on. But do not\r\nact like this to us.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, but like an honest woman, show thyself to thy worshippers,\r\nwho are worn with regretting thee all these thirteen years. Hush the\r\nnoise of battle, be a true Lysimacha to us.[361] Put an end to this\r\ntittle-tattle, to this idle babble, that set us defying one another.\r\nCause the Greeks once more to taste the pleasant beverage of friendship\r\nand temper all hearts with the gentle feeling of forgiveness. Make\r\nexcellent commodities flow to our markets, fine heads of garlic, early\r\ncucumbers, apples, pomegranates and nice little cloaks for the slaves;\r\nmake them bring geese, ducks, pigeons and larks from Boeotia and baskets\r\nof eels from Lake Copaïs; we shall all rush to buy them, disputing their\r\npossession with Morychus, Teleas, Glaucetes and every other glutton.\r\nMelanthius[362] will arrive on the market last of all; 'twill be, \"no\r\nmore eels, all sold!\" and then he'll start a-groaning and exclaiming as\r\nin his monologue of Medea,[363] \"I am dying, I am dying! Alas! I have let\r\nthose hidden in the beet escape me!\"[364] And won't we laugh? These are\r\nthe wishes, mighty goddess, which we pray thee to grant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Take the knife and slaughter the sheep like a finished cook.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, the goddess does not wish it.[365]\r\n\r\nSERVANT. And why not?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Blood cannot please Peace, so let us spill none upon her altar.\r\nTherefore go and sacrifice the sheep in the house, cut off the legs and\r\nbring them here; thus the carcase will be saved for the choragus.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You, who remain here, get chopped wood and everything needed for\r\nthe sacrifice ready.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Don't I look like a diviner preparing his mystic fire?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Undoubtedly. Will anything that it behoves a wise man to know\r\nescape you? Don't you know all that a man should know, who is\r\ndistinguished for his wisdom and inventive daring?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. There! the wood catches. Its smoke blinds poor Stilbides.[366]\r\nI am now going to bring the table and thus be my own slave.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You have braved a thousand dangers to save your sacred town. All\r\nhonour to you! your glory will be ever envied.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Hold! here are the legs, place them upon the altar. For myself,\r\nI mean to go back to the entrails and the cakes.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I'll see to those; I want you here.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Well then, here I am. Do you think I have been long?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Just get this roasted. Ah! who is this man, crowned with\r\nlaurel, who is coming to me?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. He has a self-important look; is he some diviner?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, i' faith! 'tis Hierocles.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Ah! that oracle-monger from Oreus.[367] What is he going to tell\r\nus?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Evidently he is coming to oppose the peace.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. No, 'tis the odour of the fat that attracts him.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let us appear not to see him.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Very well.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. What sacrifice is this? to what god are you offering it?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS (_to the servant_). Silence!--(_Aloud._) Look after the roasting\r\nand keep your hands off the meat.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. To whom are you sacrificing? Answer me. Ah! the tail[368] is\r\nshowing favourable omens.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Aye, very favourable, oh, loved and mighty Peace!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Come, cut off the first offering[369] and make the oblation.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis not roasted enough.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Yea, truly, 'tis done to a turn.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Mind your own business, friend! (_To the servant._) Cut away.\r\nWhere is the table? Bring the libations.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. The tongue is cut separately.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. We know all that. But just listen to one piece of advice.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. And that is?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Don't talk, for 'tis divine Peace to whom we are sacrificing.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Oh! wretched mortals, oh, you idiots!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Keep such ugly terms for yourself.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. What! you are so ignorant you don't understand the will of the\r\ngods and you make a treaty, you, who are men, with apes, who are full of\r\nmalice![370]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. What are you laughing at?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ha, ha! your apes amuse me!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. You simple pigeons, you trust yourselves to foxes, who are all\r\ncraft, both in mind and heart.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, you trouble-maker! may your lungs get as hot as this meat!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Nay, nay! if only the Nymphs had not fooled Bacis, and Bacis\r\nmortal men; and if the Nymphs had not tricked Bacis a second\r\ntime[371]....\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. May the plague seize you, if you won't stop wearying us with\r\nyour Bacis!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. ... it would not have been written in the book of Fate that\r\nthe bonds of Peace must be broken; but first....\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. The meat must be dusted with salt.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. ... it does not please the blessed gods that we should stop\r\nthe War until the wolf uniteth with the sheep.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. How, you cursed animal, could the wolf ever unite with the\r\nsheep?\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. As long as the wood-bug gives off a fetid odour, when it\r\nflies; as long as the noisy bitch is forced by nature to litter blind\r\npups, so long shall peace be forbidden.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Then what should be done? Not to stop the War would be to leave\r\nit to the decision of chance which of the two people should suffer the\r\nmost, whereas by uniting under a treaty, we share the empire of Greece.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. You will never make the crab walk straight.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You shall no longer be fed at the Prytaneum; the war done,\r\noracles are not wanted.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. You will never smooth the rough spikes of the hedgehog.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Will you never stop fooling the Athenians?\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. What oracle ordered you to burn these joints of mutton in\r\nhonour of the gods?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. This grand oracle of Homer's: \"Thus vanished the dark\r\nwar-clouds and we offered a sacrifice to new-born Peace. When the flame\r\nhad consumed the thighs of the victim and its inwards had appeased our\r\nhunger, we poured out the libations of wine.\" 'Twas I who arranged the\r\nsacred rites, but none offered the shining cup to the diviner.[372]\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. I care little for that. 'Tis not the Sibyl who spoke it.[373]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Wise Homer has also said: \"He who delights in the horrors of\r\ncivil war has neither country nor laws nor home.\" What noble words!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Beware lest the kite turn your brain and rob....\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Look out, slave! This oracle threatens our meat. Quick, pour\r\nthe libation, and give me some of the inwards.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. I too will help myself to a bit, if you like.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. The libation! the libation!\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Pour out also for me and give me some of this meat.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, the blessed gods won't allow it yet; let us drink; and as\r\nfor you, get you gone, for 'tis their will. Mighty Peace! stay ever in\r\nour midst.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. Bring the tongue hither.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Relieve us of your own.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. The libation.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Here! and this into the bargain (_strikes him_).\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. You will not give me any meat?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. We cannot give you any until the wolf unites with the sheep.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. I will embrace your knees.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Tis lost labour, good fellow; you will never smooth the rough\r\nspikes of the hedgehog.... Come, spectators, join us in our feast.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. And what am I to do?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You? go and eat the Sibyl.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. No, by the Earth! no, you shall not eat without me; if you do\r\nnot give, I take; 'tis common property.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS (_to the servant_). Strike, strike this Bacis, this humbugging\r\nsoothsayer.\r\n\r\nHIEROCLES. I take to witness....\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And I also, that you are a glutton and an impostor. Hold him\r\ntight and beat the impostor with a stick.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. You look to that; I will snatch the skin from him, which he has\r\nstolen from us.[374] Are you going to let go that skin, you priest from\r\nhell! do you hear! Oh! what a fine crow has come from Oreus! Stretch your\r\nwings quickly for Elymnium.[375]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions![376] No,\r\nI have no passion for battles; what I love, is to drink with good\r\ncomrades in the corner by the fire when good dry wood, cut in the height\r\nof the summer, is crackling; it is to cook pease on the coals and\r\nbeechnuts among the embers; 'tis to kiss our pretty Thracian[377] while\r\nmy wife is at the bath. Nothing is more pleasing, when the rain is\r\nsprouting our sowings, than to chat with some friend, saying, \"Tell me,\r\nComarchides, what shall we do? I would willingly drink myself, while the\r\nheavens are watering our fields. Come, wife, cook three measures of\r\nbeans, adding to them a little wheat, and give us some figs. Syra! call\r\nManes off the fields, 'tis impossible to prune the vine or to align the\r\nridges, for the ground is too wet to-day. Let someone bring me the thrush\r\nand those two chaffinches; there were also some curds and four pieces of\r\nhare, unless the cat stole them last evening, for I know not what the\r\ninfernal noise was that I heard in the house. Serve up three of the\r\npieces for me, slave, and give the fourth to my father. Go and ask\r\nAeschinades for some myrtle branches with berries on them, and then, for\r\n'tis the same road, you will invite Charinades to come and drink with me\r\nto the honour of the gods who watch over our crops.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the grasshopper sings its dulcet tune, I love to see the Lemnian\r\nvines beginning to ripen, for 'tis the earliest plant of all. I love\r\nlikewise to watch the fig filling out, and when it has reached maturity I\r\neat with appreciation and exclaim, \"Oh! delightful season!\" Then too I\r\nbruise some thyme and infuse it in water. Indeed I grow a great deal\r\nfatter passing the summer this way than in watching a cursed captain with\r\nhis three plumes and his military cloak of a startling crimson (he calls\r\nit true Sardian purple), which he takes care to dye himself with Cyzicus\r\nsaffron in a battle; then he is the first to run away, shaking his plumes\r\nlike a great yellow prancing cock,[378] while I am left to watch the\r\nnets.[379] Once back again in Athens, these brave fellows behave\r\nabominably; they write down these, they scratch through others, and this\r\nbackwards and forwards two or three times at random. The departure is set\r\nfor to-morrow, and some citizen has brought no provisions, because he\r\ndidn't know he had to go; he stops in front of the statue of\r\nPandion,[380] reads his name, is dumbfounded and starts away at a run,\r\nweeping bitter tears. The townsfolk are less ill-used, but that is how\r\nthe husbandmen are treated by these men of war, the hated of the gods and\r\nof men, who know nothing but how to throw away their shield. For this\r\nreason, if it please heaven, I propose to call these rascals to account,\r\nfor they are lions in times of peace, but sneaking foxes when it comes to\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! oh! what a crowd for the nuptial feast! Here! dust the\r\ntables with this crest, which is good for nothing else now. Halloa!\r\nproduce the cakes, the thrushes, plenty of good jugged hare and the\r\nlittle loaves.\r\n\r\nA SICKLE-MAKER. Trygaeus, where is Trygaeus?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I am cooking the thrushes.\r\n\r\nSICKLE-MAKER. Trygaeus, my best of friends, what a fine stroke of\r\nbusiness you have done for me by bringing back Peace! Formerly my sickles\r\nwould not have sold at an obolus apiece, to-day I am being paid fifty\r\ndrachmas for every one. And here is a neighbour who is selling his casks\r\nfor the country at three drachmae each. So come, Trygaeus, take as many\r\nsickles and casks as you will for nothing. Accept them for nothing; 'tis\r\nbecause of our handsome profits on our sales that we offer you these\r\nwedding presents.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Thanks. Put them all down inside there, and come along quick to\r\nthe banquet. Ah! do you see that armourer yonder coming with a wry face?\r\n\r\nA CREST-MAKER. Alas! alas! Trygaeus, you have ruined me utterly.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What! won't the crests go any more, friend?\r\n\r\nCREST-MAKER. You have killed my business, my livelihood, and that of this\r\npoor lance-maker too.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, come, what are you asking for these two crests?\r\n\r\nCREST-MAKER. What do you bid for them?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. What do I bid? Oh! I am ashamed to say. Still, as the clasp is\r\nof good workmanship, I would give two, even three measures of dried figs;\r\nI could use 'em for dusting the table.\r\n\r\nCREST-MAKER. All right, tell them to bring me the dried figs; 'tis always\r\nbetter than nothing.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Take them away, be off with your crests and get you gone; they\r\nare moulting, they are losing all their hair; I would not give a single\r\nfig for them.\r\n\r\nA BREASTPLATE-MAKER. Good gods, what am I going to do with this fine\r\nten-minae breast-plate, which is so splendidly made?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh, you will lose nothing over it.\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. I will sell it you at cost price.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. 'Twould be very useful as a night-stool....\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. Cease your insults, both to me and my wares.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. ... if propped on three stones. Look, 'tis admirable.\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. But how can you wipe, idiot?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. I can pass one hand through here, and the other there, and\r\nso....\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. What! do you wipe with both hands?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Aye, so that I may not be accused of robbing the State, by\r\nblocking up an oar-hole in the galley.[381]\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. So you would pay ten minae[382] for a night-stool?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Undoubtedly, you rascal. Do you think I would sell my rump for\r\na thousand drachmae?[383]\r\n\r\nBREASTPLATE-MAKER. Come, have the money paid over to me.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, friend; I find it hurts me to sit on. Take it away, I won't\r\nbuy.\r\n\r\nA TRUMPET-MAKER. What is to be done with this trumpet, for which I gave\r\nsixty drachmae the other day?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Pour lead into the hollow and fit a good, long stick to the\r\ntop; and you will have a balanced cottabos.[384]\r\n\r\nTRUMPET-MAKER. Ha! would you mock me?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Well, here's another notion. Pour in lead as I said, add here a\r\ndish hung on strings, and you will have a balance for weighing the figs\r\nwhich you give your slaves in the fields.\r\n\r\nA HELMET-MAKER. Cursed fate! I am ruined. Here are helmets, for which I\r\ngave a mina each. What am I to do with them? who will buy them?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Go and sell them to the Egyptians; they will do for measuring\r\nloosening medicines.[385]\r\n\r\nA SPEAR-MAKER. Ah! poor helmet-maker, things are indeed in a bad way.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. That man has no cause for complaint.\r\n\r\nSPEAR-MAKER. But helmets will be no more used.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Let him learn to fit a handle to them and he can sell them for\r\nmore money.[386]\r\n\r\nSPEAR-MAKER. Let us be off, comrade.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. No, I want to buy these spears.\r\n\r\nSPEAR-MAKER. What will you give?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. If they could be split in two, I would take them at a drachma\r\nper hundred to use as vine-props.\r\n\r\nSPEAR-MAKER. The insolent dog! Let us go, friend.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Ah! here come the guests, children from the table to relieve\r\nthemselves; I fancy they also want to hum over what they will be singing\r\npresently. Hi! child! what do you reckon to sing? Stand there and give me\r\nthe opening line.\r\n\r\nTHE SON OF LAMACHUS. \"Glory to the young warriors....\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! leave off about your young warriors, you little wretch; we\r\nare at peace and you are an idiot and a rascal.\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"The skirmish begins, the hollow bucklers clash against\r\neach other.\"[387]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Bucklers! Leave me in peace with your bucklers.\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"And then there came groanings and shouts of victory.\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Groanings! ah! by Bacchus! look out for yourself, you cursed\r\nsqualler, if you start wearying us again with your groanings and hollow\r\nbucklers.\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. Then what should I sing? Tell me what pleases you.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. \"'Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen,\" or something\r\nsimilar, as, for instance, \"Everything that could tickle the palate was\r\nplaced on the table.\"\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"'Tis thus they feasted on the flesh of oxen and, tired\r\nof warfare, unharnessed their foaming steeds.\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. That's splendid; tired of warfare, they seat themselves at\r\ntable; sing, sing to us how they still go on eating after they are\r\nsatiated.\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"The meal over, they girded themselves ...\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. With good wine, no doubt?\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. \"... with armour and rushed forth from the towers, and a\r\nterrible shout arose.\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Get you gone, you little scapegrace, you and your battles! You\r\nsing of nothing but warfare. Who is your father then?\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. My father?\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Why yes, your father.\r\n\r\nSON OF LAMACHUS. I am Lamachus' son.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! oh! I could indeed have sworn, when I was listening to you,\r\nthat you were the son of some warrior who dreams of nothing but wounds\r\nand bruises, of some Boulomachus or Clausimachus;[388] go and sing your\r\nplaguey songs to the spearmen.... Where is the son of Cleonymus? Sing me\r\nsomething before going back to the feast. I am at least certain he will\r\nnot sing of battles, for his father is far too careful a man.\r\n\r\nSON OF CLEONYMUS. \"An inhabitant of Saïs is parading with the spotless\r\nshield which I regret to say I have thrown into a thicket.\"[389]\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Tell me, you little good-for-nothing, are you singing that for\r\nyour father?\r\n\r\nSON or CLEONYMUS. \"But I saved my life.\"\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. And dishonoured your family. But let us go in; I am very\r\ncertain, that being the son of such a father, you will never forget this\r\nsong of the buckler. You, who remain to the feast, 'tis your duty to\r\ndevour dish after dish and not to ply empty jaws. Come, put heart into\r\nthe work and eat with your mouths full. For, believe me, poor friends,\r\nwhite teeth are useless furniture, if they chew nothing.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Never fear; thanks all the same for your good advice.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. You, who yesterday were dying of hunger, come, stuff yourselves\r\nwith this fine hare-stew; 'tis not every day that we find cakes lying\r\nneglected. Eat, eat, or I predict you will soon regret it.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Silence! Keep silence! Here is the bride about to appear! Take\r\nnuptial torches and let all rejoice and join in our songs. Then, when we\r\nhave danced, clinked our cups and thrown Hyperbolus through the doorway,\r\nwe will carry back all our farming tools to the fields and shall pray the\r\ngods to give wealth to the Greeks and to cause us all to gather in an\r\nabundant barley harvest, enjoy a noble vintage, to grant that we may\r\nchoke with good figs, that our wives may prove fruitful, that in fact we\r\nmay recover all our lost blessings, and that the sparkling fire may be\r\nrestored to the hearth.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Come, wife, to the fields and seek, my beauty, to brighten and\r\nenliven my nights. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! oh! thrice happy man, who so well\r\ndeserve your good fortune!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. What shall we do to her?\r\n\r\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. What shall we do to her?\r\n\r\nFIRST SEMI-CHORUS. We will gather her kisses.\r\n\r\nSECOND SEMI-CHORUS. We will gather her kisses.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Come, comrades, we who are in the first row, let us pick up the\r\nbridegroom and carry him in triumph. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You shall have a fine house, no cares and the finest of figs. Oh!\r\nHymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. The bridegroom's fig is great and thick; the bride's is very soft\r\nand tender.\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. While eating and drinking deep draughts of wine, continue to\r\nrepeat: Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus!\r\n\r\nTRYGAEUS. Farewell, farewell, my friends. All who come with me shall have\r\ncakes galore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFINIS OF \"PEACE\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[262] An obscene allusion, the faeces of catamites being 'well ground'\r\nfrom the treatment they are in the habit of submitting to.\r\n\r\n[263] 'Peace' was no doubt produced at the festival of the Apaturia,\r\nwhich was kept at the end of October, a period when strangers were\r\nnumerous in Athens.\r\n\r\n[264] The winged steed of Perseus--an allusion to a lost tragedy of\r\nEuripides, in which Bellerophon was introduced riding on Pegasus.\r\n\r\n[265] Fearing that if it caught a whiff from earth to its liking, the\r\nbeetle might descend from the highest heaven to satisfy itself.\r\n\r\n[266] The Persians and the Spartans were not then allied as the Scholiast\r\nstates, since a treaty between them was only concluded in 412 B.C., i.e.\r\neight years after the production of 'Peace'; the great king, however, was\r\ntrying to derive advantages out of the dissensions in Greece.\r\n\r\n[267] _Go to the crows_, a proverbial expression equivalent to our _Go to\r\nthe devil_.\r\n\r\n[268] Aesop tells us that the eagle and the beetle were at war; the eagle\r\ndevoured the beetle's young and the latter got into its nest and tumbled\r\nout its eggs. On this the eagle complained to Zeus, who advised it to lay\r\nits eggs in his bosom; but the beetle flew up to the abode of Zeus, who,\r\nforgetful of the eagle's eggs, at once rose to chase off the\r\nobjectionable insect. The eggs fell to earth and were smashed to bits.\r\n\r\n[269] Pegasus is introduced by Euripides both in his 'Andromeda' and his\r\n'Bellerophon.'\r\n\r\n[270] Boats, called 'beetles,' doubtless because in form they resembled\r\nthese insects, were built at Naxos.\r\n\r\n[271] Nature had divided the Piraeus into three basins--Cantharos,\r\nAphrodisium and Zea; [Greek: kántharos] is Greek for a dung-beetle.\r\n\r\n[272] In allusion to Euripides' fondness for introducing lame heroes in\r\nhis plays.\r\n\r\n[273] An allusion to the proverbial nickname applied to the\r\nChians--[Greek: Chios apopat_on], \"shitting Chian.\" On account of their\r\nnotoriously pederastic habits, the inhabitants of this island were known\r\nthroughout Greece as '_loose-arsed_' Chians, and therefore always on the\r\npoint of voiding their faeces. There is a further joke, of course, in\r\nconnection with the hundred and one frivolous pretexts which the\r\nAthenians invented for exacting contributions from the maritime allies.\r\n\r\n[274] Masters of Pylos and Sphacteria, the Athenians had brought home the\r\nthree hundred prisoners taken in the latter place in 425 B.C.; the\r\nSpartans had several times sent envoys to offer peace and to demand back\r\nboth Pylos and the prisoners, but the Athenian pride had caused these\r\nproposals to be long refused. Finally the prisoners had been given up in\r\n423 B.C., but the War was continued nevertheless.\r\n\r\n[275] An important town in Eastern Laconia on the Argolic gulf,\r\ncelebrated for a temple where a festival was held annually in honour of\r\nAchilles. It had been taken and pillaged by the Athenians in the second\r\nyear of the Peloponnesian War, 430 B.C. As he utters this imprecation,\r\nWar throws some leeks, [Greek: prasa], the root-word of the name Prasiae,\r\ninto his mortar.\r\n\r\n[276] War throws some garlic into his mortar as emblematical of the city\r\nof Megara, where it was grown in abundance.\r\n\r\n[277] Because the smell of bruised garlic causes the eyes to water.\r\n\r\n[278] He throws cheese into the mortar as emblematical of Sicily, on\r\naccount of its rich pastures.\r\n\r\n[279] Emblematical of Athens. The honey of Mount Hymettus was famous.\r\n\r\n[280] Cleon, who had lately fallen before Amphipolis, in 422 B.C.\r\n\r\n[281] An island in the Aegean Sea, on the coast of Thrace and opposite\r\nthe mouth of the Hebrus; the Mysteries are said to have found their first\r\nhome in this island, where the Cabirian gods were worshipped; this cult,\r\nshrouded in deep mystery to even the initiates themselves, has remained\r\nan almost insoluble problem for the modern critic. It was said that the\r\nwishes of the initiates were always granted, and they were feared as\r\nto-day the _jettatori_ (spell-throwers, casters of the evil eye) in\r\nSicily are feared.\r\n\r\n[282] Brasidas perished in Thrace in the same battle as Cleon at\r\nAmphipolis, 422 B.C.\r\n\r\n[283] An Athenian general as ambitious as he was brave. In 423 B.C. he\r\nhad failed in an enterprise against Heraclea, a storm having destroyed\r\nhis fleet. Since then he had distinguished himself in several actions,\r\nand was destined, some years later, to share the command of the\r\nexpedition to Sicily with Alcibiades and Nicias.\r\n\r\n[284] Meaning, to start on a military expedition.\r\n\r\n[285] Cleon.\r\n\r\n[286] The Chorus insist on the conventional choric dance.\r\n\r\n[287] One of the most favourite games with the Greeks. A stick was set\r\nupright in the ground and to this the beam of a balance was attached by\r\nits centre. Two vessels were hung from the extremities of the beam so as\r\nto balance; beneath these two other and larger dishes were placed and\r\nfilled with water, and in the middle of each a brazen figure, called\r\nManes, was stood. The game consisted in throwing drops of wine from an\r\nagreed distance into one or the other vessel, so that, dragged downwards\r\nby the weight of the liquor, it bumped against Manes.\r\n\r\n[288] A general of austere habits; he disposed of all his property to pay\r\nthe cost of a naval expedition, in which he beat the fleet of the foe off\r\nthe promontory of Rhium in 429 B.C.\r\n\r\n[289] The Lyceum was a portico ornamented with paintings and surrounded\r\nwith gardens, in which military exercises took place.\r\n\r\n[290] A citizen of Miletus, who betrayed his country to the people of\r\nPriené. When asked what he purposed, he replied, \"Nothing bad,\" which\r\nexpression had therefore passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\n[291] Hermes was the god of chance.\r\n\r\n[292] As the soldiers had to do when starting on an expedition.\r\n\r\n[293] That is, you are pedicated.\r\n\r\n[294] The initiated were thought to enjoy greater happiness after death.\r\n\r\n[295] He summons Zeus to reveal Trygaeus' conspiracy.\r\n\r\n[296] An Athenian captain, who later had the recall of Alcibiades decreed\r\nby the Athenian people; in 'The Birds' Aristophanes represents him as a\r\ncowardly braggart. He was the reactionary leader who established the\r\nOligarchical Government of the Four Hundred, 411 B.C., after the failure\r\nof the Syracusan expedition.\r\n\r\n[297] Among other attributes, Hermes was the god of thieves.\r\n\r\n[298] Alluding to the eclipses of the sun and the moon.\r\n\r\n[299] The Panathenaea were dedicated to Athené, the Mysteries to Demeter,\r\nthe Dipolia to Zeus, the Adonia to Aphrodité and Adonis. Trygaeus\r\npromises Hermes that he shall be worshipped in the place of all the other\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n[300] The pun here cannot be kept. The word [Greek: paian], Paean,\r\nresembles [Greek: paiein], to strike; hence the word, as recalling the\r\nblows and wounds of the war, seems of ill omen to Trygaeus.\r\n\r\n[301] The device on his shield was a Gorgon's head. (_See_ 'The\r\nAcharnians.')\r\n\r\n[302] Both Sparta and Athens had sought the alliance of the Argives; they\r\nhad kept themselves strictly neutral and had received pay from both\r\nsides. But, the year after the production of 'The Wasps,' they openly\r\njoined Athens, had attacked Epidaurus and got cut to pieces by the\r\nSpartans.\r\n\r\n[303] These are the Spartan prisoners from Sphacteria, who were lying in\r\ngaol at Athens. They were chained fast to large beams of wood.\r\n\r\n[304] 'Twas want of force, not want of will. They had suffered more than\r\nany other people from the war. (_See_ 'The Acharnians.')\r\n\r\n[305] Meaning, look chiefly to your fleet. This was the counsel that\r\nThemistocles frequently gave the Athenians.\r\n\r\n[306] A metaphor referring to the abundant vintages that peace would\r\nassure.\r\n\r\n[307] The goddess of fruits.\r\n\r\n[308] Aristophanes personifies under this name the sacred ceremonies in\r\ngeneral which peace would allow to be celebrated with due pomp. Opora and\r\nTheoria come on the stage in the wake of Peace, clothed and decked out as\r\ncourtesans.\r\n\r\n[309] Aristophanes has already shown us the husbandmen and workers in\r\npeaceful trades pulling at the rope to extricate Peace, while the\r\narmourers hindered them by pulling the other way.\r\n\r\n[310] An allusion to Lamachus' shield.\r\n\r\n[311] Having been commissioned to execute a statue of Athené, Phidias was\r\naccused of having stolen part of the gold given him out of the public\r\ntreasury for its decoration. Rewarded for his work by calumny and\r\nbanishment, he resolved to make a finer statue than his Athené, and\r\nexecuted one for the temple of Elis, that of the Olympian Zeus, which was\r\nconsidered one of the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n[312] He had issued a decree, which forbade the admission of any Megarian\r\non Attic soil, and also all trade with that people. The Megarians, who\r\nobtained all their provisions from Athens, were thus almost reduced to\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n[313] That is, the vineyards were ravaged from the very outset of the\r\nwar, and this increased the animosity.\r\n\r\n[314] Driven in from the country parts by the Lacedaemonian invaders.\r\n\r\n[315] The demagogues, who distributed the slender dole given to the poor,\r\nand by that means exercised undue power over them.\r\n\r\n[316] Meaning, the side of the Spartans.\r\n\r\n[317] Cleon.\r\n\r\n[318] It was Hermes who conducted the souls of the dead down to the lower\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n[319] The Spartans had thrice offered to make peace after the Pylos\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n[320] i.e. dominated by Cleon.\r\n\r\n[321] There is a pun here, that cannot be rendered, between [Greek:\r\napobolimaios], which means, _one who throws away his weapons_, and\r\n[Greek: upobolimaios], which signifies, _a supposititious child_.\r\n\r\n[322] Simonides was very avaricious, and sold his pen to the highest\r\nbidder. It seems that Sophocles had also started writing for gain.\r\n\r\n[323] i.e. he would recoil from no risk to turn an honest penny.\r\n\r\n[324] A comic poet as well known for his love of wine as for his\r\nwritings; he died in 431 B.C., the first year of the war, at the age of\r\nninety-seven.\r\n\r\n[325] Opora was the goddess of fruits.\r\n\r\n[326] The Scholiast says fruit may be eaten with impunity in great\r\nquantities if care is taken to drink a decoction of this herb afterwards.\r\n\r\n[327] Theoria is confided to the care of the Senate, because it was this\r\nbody who named the [Greek: The_orhoi], deputies appointed to go and\r\nconsult the oracles beyond the Attic borders or to be present at feasts\r\nand games.\r\n\r\n[328] The great festivals, e.g. the Dionysia, lasted three days. Those in\r\nhonour of the return of Peace, which was so much desired, could not last\r\na shorter time.\r\n\r\n[329] In spite of what he says, Aristophanes has not always disdained\r\nthis sort of low comedy--for instance, his Heracles in 'The Birds.'\r\n\r\n[330] A celebrated Athenian courtesan of Aristophanes' day.\r\n\r\n[331] Cleon. These four verses are here repeated from the parabasis of\r\n'The Wasps,' produced 423 B.C., the year before this play.\r\n\r\n[332] Shafts aimed at certain poets, who used their renown as a means of\r\nseducing young men to grant them pederastic favours.\r\n\r\n[333] The poet supplied everything needful for the production of his\r\npiece--vases, dresses, masks, etc.\r\n\r\n[334] Aristophanes was bald himself, it would seem.\r\n\r\n[335] Carcinus and his three sons were both poets and dancers. (_See_ the\r\nclosing scene of 'The Wasps.') Perhaps relying little on the literary\r\nvalue of their work, it seems that they sought to please the people by\r\nthe magnificence of its staging.\r\n\r\n[336] He had written a piece called 'The Mice,' which he succeeded with\r\ngreat difficulty in getting played, but it met with no success.\r\n\r\n[337] This passage really follows on the invocation, \"_Oh, Muse! drive\r\nthe War_,\" etc., from which indeed it is only divided by the interpolated\r\ncriticism aimed at Carcinus.\r\n\r\n[338] The Scholiast informs us that these verses are borrowed from a poet\r\nof the sixth century B.C.\r\n\r\n[339] Sons of Philocles, of the family of Aeschylus, tragic writers,\r\nderided by Aristophanes as bad poets and notorious gluttons.\r\n\r\n[340] The Gorgons were represented with great teeth, and therefore the\r\nsame name was given to gluttons. The Harpies, to whom the two voracious\r\npoets are also compared, were monsters with the face of a woman, the body\r\nof a vulture and hooked beak and claws.\r\n\r\n[341] A tragic and dithyrambic poet, who had written many pieces, which\r\nhad met with great success at Athens.\r\n\r\n[342] The shooting stars.\r\n\r\n[343] That is, men's tools;--we can set her to 'fellate.'\r\n\r\n[344] It has already been mentioned that the sons of Carcinus were\r\ndancers.\r\n\r\n[345] It was customary at weddings, says Menander, to give the bride a\r\nsesame-cake as an emblem of fruitfulness, because sesame is the most\r\nfruitful of all seeds.\r\n\r\n[346] An Attic town on the east coast, noted for a magnificent temple, in\r\nwhich stood the statue of Artemis, which Orestes and Iphigenia had\r\nbrought from the Tauric Chersonese and also for the Brauronia, festivals\r\nthat were celebrated every four years in honour of the goddess. This was\r\none of the festivals which the Attic people kept with the greatest pomp,\r\nand was an occasion for debauchery.\r\n\r\n[347] Competitors intending to take part in the great Olympic, Isthmian\r\nand other games took with them a tent, wherein to camp in the open.\r\nFurther, there is an obscene allusion which the actor indicates by\r\ngesture, pointing to the girl's privates, signifying there is the lodging\r\nwhere he would fain find a delightful abode. The 'Isthmus' is the\r\nperineum, the narrow space betwixt _anus_ and _cunnus_.\r\n\r\n[348] He was a 'cunnilingue,' as we gather also from what Aristophanes\r\nsays of his infamous habits in the 'Knights.'\r\n\r\n[349] Doubtless the vessels and other sacrificial objects and implements\r\nwith which Theoria was laden in her character of presiding deity at\r\nreligious ceremonies.\r\n\r\n[350] The whole passage is full of obscene _double entendres_. Theoria\r\nthroughout is spoken of in words applicable to either of her twofold\r\ncharacter--as a sacred, religious feast, and as a lady of pleasure.\r\n\r\n[351] Where the meats were cooked after sacrifice; Trygaeus points to\r\nTheoria's privates, marking the secondary obscene sense he means to\r\nconvey.\r\n\r\n[352] \"Or otherwise\"--that is, with the standing penis. The whole\r\nsentence contains a series of allusions to different 'modes of love.'\r\n\r\n[353] One of the offices of the Prytanes was to introduce those who asked\r\nadmission to the Senate, but it would seem that none could obtain this\r\nfavour without payment. Without this, a thousand excuses would be made;\r\nfor instance, it would be a public holiday, and consequently the Senate\r\ncould receive no one. As there was some festival nearly every day, he\r\nwhose purse would not open might have to wait a very long while.\r\n\r\n[354] This was only offered to lesser deities.\r\n\r\n[355] In the Greek we have a play upon the similarity of the words,\r\n[Greek: bous], a bull, and [Greek: boan], to shout the battle cry.\r\n\r\n[356] Theagenes, of the Piraeus, a hideous, coarse, debauched and\r\nevil-living character of the day.\r\n\r\n[357] That is the vocative of [Greek: oïs], [Greek: oïos], the Ionic form\r\nof the word; in Attic Greek it is contracted throughout--[Greek: ois],\r\n[Greek: oios], etc.\r\n\r\n[358] An obscene jest. The Greek word, says the Scholiast, means both\r\nbarley and the male organ.\r\n\r\n[359] Before sacrificing, the officiating person asked, \"_Who is here?_\"\r\nand those present answered, \"_Many good men._\"\r\n\r\n[360] The actors forming the chorus are meant here.\r\n\r\n[361] Lysimacha is derived from [Greek: luein], to put an end to, and\r\n[Greek: mach_e], fight.\r\n\r\n[362] A tragic poet, reputed a great gourmand.\r\n\r\n[363] A tragedy by Melanthius.\r\n\r\n[364] Eels were cooked with beet.--A parody on some verses in the 'Medea'\r\nof Melanthius.\r\n\r\n[365] As a matter of fact, the Sicyonians, who celebrated the festival of\r\nPeace on the sixteenth day of the month of hecatombeon (July), spilled no\r\nblood upon her altar.\r\n\r\n[366] A celebrated diviner, who had accompanied the Athenians on their\r\nexpedition to Sicily. Thus the War was necessary to make his calling pay\r\nand the smoke of the sacrifice offered to Peace must therefore be\r\nunpleasant to him.\r\n\r\n[367] A town in Euboea on the channel which separated that island from\r\nThessaly.\r\n\r\n[368] When sacrificing, the tail was cut off the victim and thrown into\r\nthe fire. From the way in which it burnt the inference was drawn as to\r\nwhether or not the sacrifice was agreeable to the deity.\r\n\r\n[369] This was the part that belonged to the priests and diviners. As one\r\nof the latter class, Hierocles is in haste to see this piece cut off.\r\n\r\n[370] The Spartans.\r\n\r\n[371] Emphatic pathos, incomprehensible even to the diviner himself; this\r\nis a satire on the obscure style of the oracles. Bacis was a famous\r\nBoeotian diviner.\r\n\r\n[372] Of course this is not a _bona fide_ quotation, but a whimsical\r\nadaptation of various Homeric verses; the last is a coinage of his own,\r\nand means, that he is to have no part, either in the flesh of the victim\r\nor in the wine of the libations.\r\n\r\n[373] Probably the Sibyl of Delphi is meant.\r\n\r\n[374] The skin of the victim, that is to say.\r\n\r\n[375] A temple of Euboea, close to Oreus. The servant means, \"Return\r\nwhere you came from.\"\r\n\r\n[376] This was the soldier's usual ration when on duty.\r\n\r\n[377] Slaves often bore the name of the country of their birth.\r\n\r\n[378] Because of the new colour which fear had lent his chlamys.\r\n\r\n[379] Meaning, that he deserts his men in mid-campaign, leaving them to\r\nlook after the enemy.\r\n\r\n[380] Ancient King of Athens. This was one of the twelve statues, on the\r\npedestals of which the names of the soldiers chosen for departure on\r\nservice were written. The decrees were also placarded on them.\r\n\r\n[381] The trierarchs stopped up some of the holes made for the oars, in\r\norder to reduce the number of rowers they had to supply for the galleys;\r\nthey thus saved the wages of the rowers they dispensed with.\r\n\r\n[382] The mina was equivalent to about £3 10s.\r\n\r\n[383] Which is the same thing, since a mina was worth a hundred drachmae.\r\n\r\n[384] For _cottabos_ see note above, p. 177. [Footnote 287. Transcriber.]\r\n\r\n[385] _Syrmaea_, a kind of purgative syrup much used by the Egyptians,\r\nmade of antiscorbutic herbs, such as mustard, horse-radish, etc.\r\n\r\n[386] As wine-pots or similar vessels.\r\n\r\n[387] These verses and those which both Trygaeus and the son of Lamachus\r\nquote afterwards are borrowed from the 'Iliad.'\r\n\r\n[388] Boulomachus is derived from [Greek: boulesthai] and [Greek: mach_e]\r\nto wish for battle; Clausimachus from [Greek: klaein] and [Greek:\r\nmach_e], the tears that battles cost. The same root, [Greek: mach_e],\r\nbattle, is also contained in the name Lamachus.\r\n\r\n[389] A distich borrowed from Archilochus, a celebrated poet of the\r\nseventh century B.C., born at Paros, and the author of odes, satires,\r\nepigrams and elegies. He sang his own shame. 'Twas in an expedition\r\nagainst Saïs, not the town in Egypt as the similarity in name might lead\r\none to believe, but in Thrace, that he had cast away his buckler. \"A\r\nmighty calamity truly!\" he says without shame. \"I shall buy another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe 'Lysistrata,' the third and concluding play of the War and Peace\r\nseries, was not produced till ten years later than its predecessor, the\r\n'Peace,' viz. in 411 B.C. It is now the twenty-first year of the War, and\r\nthere seems as little prospect of peace as ever. A desperate state of\r\nthings demands a desperate remedy, and the Poet proceeds to suggest a\r\nburlesque solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe women of Athens, led by Lysistrata and supported by female delegates\r\nfrom the other states of Hellas, determine to take matters into their own\r\nhands and force the men to stop the War. They meet in solemn conclave,\r\nand Lysistrata expounds her scheme, the rigorous application to husbands\r\nand lovers of a self-denying ordinance--\"we must refrain from the male\r\norgan altogether.\" Every wife and mistress is to refuse all sexual\r\nfavours whatsoever, till the men have come to terms of peace. In cases\r\nwhere the women _must_ yield 'par force majeure,' then it is to be with\r\nan ill grace and in such a way as to afford the minimum of gratification\r\nto their partner; they are to lie passive and take no more part in the\r\namorous game than they are absolutely obliged to. By these means\r\nLysistrata assures them they will very soon gain their end. \"If we sit\r\nindoors prettily dressed out in our best transparent silks and prettiest\r\ngewgaws, and with our 'mottes' all nicely depilated, their tools will\r\nstand up so stiff that they will be able to deny us nothing.\" Such is the\r\nburden of her advice.\r\n\r\nAfter no little demur, this plan of campaign is adopted, and the\r\nassembled women take a solemn oath to observe the compact faithfully.\r\nMeantime as a precautionary measure they seize the Acropolis, where the\r\nState treasure is kept; the old men of the city assault the doors, but\r\nare repulsed by \"the terrible regiment\" of women. Before long the device\r\nof the bold Lysistrata proves entirely effective, Peace is concluded, and\r\nthe play ends with the hilarious festivities of the Athenian and Spartan\r\nplenipotentiaries in celebration of the event.\r\n\r\nThis drama has a double Chorus--of women and of old men, and much\r\nexcellent fooling is got out of the fight for possession of the citadel\r\nbetween the two hostile bands; while the broad jokes and decidedly\r\nsuggestive situations arising out of the general idea of the plot\r\noutlined above may be \"better imagined than described.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA.\r\nCALONICÉ.\r\nMYRRHINÉ.\r\nLAMPITO.\r\nSTRATYLLIS.\r\nA MAGISTRATE.\r\nCINESIAS.\r\nA CHILD.\r\nHERALD OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS.\r\nENVOYS OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS.\r\nPOLYCHARIDES.\r\nMARKET LOUNGERS.\r\nA SERVANT.\r\nAN ATHENIAN CITIZEN.\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN.\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\nSCENE: In a public square at Athens; afterwards before the gates of the\r\nAcropolis, and finally within the precincts of the citadel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA\r\n\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA (_alone_). Ah! if only they had been invited to a Bacchic\r\nrevelling, or a feast of Pan or Aphrodité or Genetyllis,[390] why! the\r\nstreets would have been impassable for the thronging tambourines! Now\r\nthere's never a woman here-ah! except my neighbour Calonicé, whom I see\r\napproaching yonder.... Good day, Calonicé.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Good day, Lysistrata; but pray, why this dark, forbidding face,\r\nmy dear? Believe me, you don't look a bit pretty with those black\r\nlowering brows.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! Calonicé, my heart is on fire; I blush for our sex. Men\r\n_will_ have it we are tricky and sly....\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. And they are quite right, upon my word!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yet, look you, when the women are summoned to meet for a\r\nmatter of the last importance, they lie abed instead of coming.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Oh! they will come, my dear; but 'tis not easy, you know, for\r\nwomen to leave the house. One is busy pottering about her husband;\r\nanother is getting the servant up; a third is putting her child asleep,\r\nor washing the brat or feeding it.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. But I tell you, the business that calls them here is far and\r\naway more urgent.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. And why _do_ you summon us, dear Lysistrata? What is it all\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. About a big affair.[391]\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. And is it thick too?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yes indeed, both big and great.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. And we are not all on the spot!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! if it were what you suppose, there would be never an\r\nabsentee. No, no, it concerns a thing I have turned about and about this\r\nway and that of many sleepless nights.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. It must be something mighty fine and subtle for you to have\r\nturned it about so!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. So fine, it means just this, Greece saved by the women!\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. By women! Why, its salvation hangs on a poor thread then!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Our country's fortunes depend on us--it is with us to undo\r\nutterly the Peloponnesians....\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. That would be a noble deed truly!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. To exterminate the Boeotians to a man!\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But surely you would spare the eels.[392]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. For Athens' sake I will never threaten so fell a doom; trust\r\nme for that. However, if the Boeotian and Peloponnesian women join us,\r\nGreece is saved.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But how should women perform so wise and glorious an\r\nachievement, we women who dwell in the retirement of the household, clad\r\nin diaphanous garments of yellow silk and long flowing gowns, decked out\r\nwith flowers and shod with dainty little slippers?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Nay, but those are the very sheet-anchors of our\r\nsalvation--those yellow tunics, those scents and slippers, those\r\ncosmetics and transparent robes.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. How so, pray?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. There is not a man will wield a lance against another ...\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Quick, I will get me a yellow tunic from the dyer's.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. ... or want a shield.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. I'll run and put on a flowing gown.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. ... or draw a sword.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. I'll haste and buy a pair of slippers this instant.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Now tell me, would not the women have done best to come?\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Why, they should have _flown_ here!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! my dear, you'll see that like true Athenians, they will\r\ndo everything too late[393].... Why, there's not a woman come from the\r\nshoreward parts, not one from Salamis.[394]\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But I know for certain they embarked at daybreak.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And the dames from Acharnae![395] why, I thought they would\r\nhave been the very first to arrive.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Theagenes wife[396] at any rate is sure to come; she has\r\nactually been to consult Hecaté.... But look! here are some arrivals--and\r\nthere are more behind. Ah! ha! now what countrywomen may they be?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. They are from Anagyra.[397]\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Yes! upon my word, 'tis a levy _en masse_ of all the female\r\npopulation of Anagyra!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Are we late, Lysistrata? Tell us, pray; what, not a word?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. I cannot say much for you, Myrrhiné! you have not bestirred\r\nyourself overmuch for an affair of such urgency.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ I could not find my girdle in the dark. However, if the matter\r\nis so pressing, here we are; so speak.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. No, but let us wait a moment more, till the women of Boeotia\r\narrive and those from the Peloponnese.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ Yes, that is best.... Ah! here comes Lampito.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Good day, Lampito, dear friend from Lacedaemon. How well and\r\nhandsome you look! what a rosy complexion! and how strong you seem; why,\r\nyou could strangle a bull surely!\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Yes, indeed, I really think I could. 'Tis because I do\r\ngymnastics and practise the kick dance.[398]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And what superb bosoms!\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. La! you are feeling me as if I were a beast for sacrifice.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And this young woman, what countrywoman is she?\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. She is a noble lady from Boeotia.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! my pretty Boeotian friend, you are as blooming as a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Yes, on my word! and the garden is so prettily weeded too![399]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And who is this?\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. 'Tis an honest woman, by my faith! she comes from Corinth.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! honest, no doubt then--as honesty goes at Corinth.[400]\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. But who has called together this council of women, pray?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. I have.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Well then, tell us what you want of us.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. With pleasure, my dear.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. What is the most important business you wish to inform us\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. I will tell you. But first answer me one question.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. What is that?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Don't you feel sad and sorry because the fathers of your\r\nchildren are far away from you with the army? For I'll undertake, there\r\nis not one of you whose husband is not abroad at this moment.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Mine has been the last five months in Thrace--looking after\r\nEucrates.[401]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. 'Tis seven long months since mine left me for Pylos.[402]\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. As for mine, if he ever does return from service, he's no sooner\r\nback than he takes down his shield again and flies back to the wars.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And not so much as the shadow of a lover! Since the day the\r\nMilesians betrayed us, I have never once seen an eight-inch-long\r\n_godemiche_ even, to be a leathern consolation to us poor widows.... Now\r\ntell me, if I have discovered a means of ending the war, will you all\r\nsecond me?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes verily, by all the goddesses, I swear I will, though I have\r\nto put my gown in pawn, and drink the money the same day.[403]\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. And so will I, though I must be split in two like a flat-fish,\r\nand have half myself removed.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. And I too; why, to secure Peace, I would climb to the top of\r\nMount Taygetus.[404]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then I will out with it at last, my mighty secret! Oh! sister\r\nwomen, if we would compel our husbands to make peace, we must refrain....\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Refrain from what? tell us, tell us!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. But will you do it?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. We will, we will, though we should die of it.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. We must refrain from the male organ altogether.... Nay, why\r\ndo you turn your backs on me? Where are you going? So, you bite your\r\nlips, and shake your heads, eh? Why these pale, sad looks? why these\r\ntears? Come, will you do it--yes or no? Do you hesitate?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No, I will not do it; let the War go on.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And you, my pretty flat-fish, who declared just now they\r\nmight split you in two?\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Anything, anything but that! Bid me go through the fire, if you\r\nwill; but to rob us of the sweetest thing in all the world, my dear, dear\r\nLysistrata!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And you?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, I agree with the others; I too would sooner go through the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh, wanton, vicious sex! the poets have done well to make\r\ntragedies upon us; we are good for nothing then but love and\r\nlewdness![405] But you, my dear, you from hardy Sparta, if _you_ join me,\r\nall may yet be well; help me, second me, I conjure you.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. 'Tis a hard thing, by the two goddesses[406] it is! for a woman\r\nto sleep alone without ever a standing weapon in her bed. But there,\r\nPeace must come first.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh, my dear, my dearest, best friend, you are the only one\r\ndeserving the name of woman!\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But if--which the gods forbid--we do refrain altogether from\r\nwhat you say, should we get peace any sooner?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Of course we should, by the goddesses twain! We need only sit\r\nindoors with painted cheeks, and meet our mates lightly clad in\r\ntransparent gowns of Amorgos[407] silk, and with our \"mottes\" nicely\r\nplucked smooth; then their tools will stand like mad and they will be\r\nwild to lie with us. That will be the time to refuse, and they will\r\nhasten to make peace, I am convinced of that!\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Yes, just as Menelaus, when he saw Helen's naked bosom, threw\r\naway his sword, they say.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But, poor devils, suppose our husbands go away and leave us.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then, as Pherecrates says, we must \"flay a skinned dog,\"[408]\r\nthat's all.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Bah! these proverbs are all idle talk.... But if our husbands\r\ndrag us by main force into the bedchamber?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Hold on to the door posts.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But if they beat us?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then yield to their wishes, but with a bad grace; there is no\r\npleasure for them, when they do it by force. Besides, there are a\r\nthousand ways of tormenting them. Never fear, they'll soon tire of the\r\ngame; there's no satisfaction for a man, unless the woman shares it.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Very well, if you _will_ have it so, we agree.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. For ourselves, no doubt we shall persuade our husbands to\r\nconclude a fair and honest peace; but there is the Athenian populace, how\r\nare we to cure these folk of their warlike frenzy?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Have no fear; we undertake to make our own people hear\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Nay, impossible, so long as they have their trusty ships and the\r\nvast treasures stored in the temple of Athené.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! but we have seen to that; this very day the Acropolis\r\nwill be in our hands. That is the task assigned to the older women; while\r\nwe are here in council, they are going, under pretence of offering\r\nsacrifice, to seize the citadel.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Well said indeed! so everything is going for the best.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Come, quick, Lampito, and let us bind ourselves by an\r\ninviolable oath.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Recite the terms; we will swear to them.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. With pleasure. Where is our Usheress?[409] Now, what are you\r\nstaring at, pray? Lay this shield on the earth before us, its hollow\r\nupwards, and someone bring me the victim's inwards.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Lysistrata, say, what oath are we to swear?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What oath? Why, in Aeschylus, they sacrifice a sheep, and\r\nswear over a buckler;[410] we will do the same.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. No, Lysistrata, one cannot swear peace over a buckler, surely.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What other oath do you prefer?\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Let's take a white horse, and sacrifice it, and swear on its\r\nentrails.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. But where get a white horse from?\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Well, what oath shall we take then?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Listen to me. Let's set a great black bowl on the ground;\r\nlet's sacrifice a skin of Thasian[411] wine into it, and take oath not to\r\nadd one single drop of water.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Ah! that's an oath pleases me more than I can say.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Let them bring me a bowl and a skin of wine.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Ah! my dears, what a noble big bowl! what a delight 'twill be\r\nto empty it!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Set the bowl down on the ground, and lay your hands on the\r\nvictim.... Almighty goddess, Persuasion, and thou, bowl, boon comrade of\r\njoy and merriment, receive this our sacrifice, and be propitious to us\r\npoor women!\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Oh! the fine red blood! how well it flows!\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. And what a delicious savour, by the goddesses twain!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Now, my dears, let me swear first, if you please.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. No, by the goddess of love, let us decide that by lot.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Come then, Lampito, and all of you, put your hands to the\r\nbowl; and do you, Calonicé, repeat in the name of all the solemn terms I\r\nam going to recite. Then you must all swear, and pledge yourselves by the\r\nsame promises.--\"_I will have naught to do whether with lover or\r\nhusband...._\"\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _I will have naught to do whether with lover or husband...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _Albeit he come to me with stiff and standing tool...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _Albeit he come to me with stiff and standing tool...._ Oh!\r\nLysistrata, I cannot bear it!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _I will live at home in perfect chastity...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _I will live at home in perfect chastity...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _Beautifully dressed and wearing a saffron-coloured gown...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _Beautifully dressed and wearing a saffron-coloured gown...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _To the end I may inspire my husband with the most ardent\r\nlongings._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _To the end I may inspire my husband with the most ardent\r\nlongings._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _Never will I give myself voluntarily...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _Never will I give myself voluntarily...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _And if he has me by force...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _And if he has me by force...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _I will be cold as ice, and never stir a limb...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _I will be cold as ice, and never stir a limb...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _I will not lift my legs in air...._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _I will not lift my legs in air...._\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _Nor will I crouch with bottom upraised, like carven lions on\r\na knife-handle_.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _Nor will I crouch with bottom upraised, like carven lions on a\r\nknife-handle_.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _An if I keep my oath, may I be suffered to drink of this\r\nwine._\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _An if I keep my oath, may I be suffered to drink of this\r\nwine_.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. _But if I break it, let my bowl be filled with water_.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. _But if I break it, let my bowl be filled with water_.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Will ye all take this oath?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, yes!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then lo! I immolate the victim. (_She drinks._)\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Enough, enough, my dear; now let us all drink in turn to cement\r\nour friendship.\r\n\r\nLAMPITO. Hark! what do those cries mean?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. 'Tis what I was telling you; the women have just occupied the\r\nAcropolis. So now, Lampito, do you return to Sparta to organize the plot,\r\nwhile your comrades here remain as hostages. For ourselves, let us away\r\nto join the rest in the citadel, and let us push the bolts well home.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. But don't you think the men will march up against us?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. I laugh at them. Neither threats nor flames shall force our\r\ndoors; they shall open only on the conditions I have named.\r\n\r\nCALONICÉ. Yes, yes, by the goddess of love! let us keep up our old-time\r\nrepute for obstinacy and spite.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN.[412] Go easy, Draces, go easy; why, your shoulder is\r\nall chafed by these plaguey heavy olive stocks. But forward still,\r\nforward, man, as needs must. What unlooked-for things do happen, to be\r\nsure, in a long life! Ah! Strymodorus, who would ever have thought it?\r\nHere we have the women, who used, for our misfortune, to eat our bread\r\nand live in our houses, daring nowadays to lay hands on the holy image of\r\nthe goddess, to seize the Acropolis and draw bars and bolts to keep any\r\nfrom entering! Come, Philurgus man, let's hurry thither; let's lay our\r\nfaggots all about the citadel, and on the blazing pile burn with our\r\nhands these vile conspiratresses, one and all--and Lycon's wife,\r\nLysistrata, first and foremost! Nay, by Demeter, never will I let 'em\r\nlaugh at me, whiles I have a breath left in my body. Cleomenes\r\nhimself,[413] the first who ever seized our citadel, had to quit it to\r\nhis sore dishonour; spite his Lacedaemonian pride, he had to deliver me\r\nup his arms and slink off with a single garment to his back. My word! but\r\nhe was filthy and ragged! and what an unkempt beard, to be sure! He had\r\nnot had a bath for six long years! Oh! but that was a mighty siege! Our\r\nmen were ranged seventeen deep before the gate, and never left their\r\nposts, even to sleep. These women, these enemies of Euripides and all the\r\ngods, shall I do nothing to hinder their inordinate insolence? else let\r\nthem tear down my trophies of Marathon. But look ye, to finish our\r\ntoilsome climb, we have only this last steep bit left to mount. Verily\r\n'tis no easy job without beasts of burden, and how these logs do bruise\r\nmy shoulder! Still let us on, and blow up our fire and see it does not go\r\nout just as we reach our destination. Phew! phew! (_blows the fire_). Oh!\r\ndear! what a dreadful smoke! it bites my eyes like a mad dog. It is\r\nLemnos[414] fire for sure, or it would never devour my eyelids like this.\r\nCome on, Laches, let's hurry, let's bring succour to the goddess; it's\r\nnow or never! Phew! phew! (_blows the fire_). Oh! dear! what a confounded\r\nsmoke!--There now, there's our fire all bright and burning, thank the\r\ngods! Now, why not first put down our loads here, then take a\r\nvine-branch, light it at the brazier and hurl it at the gate by way of\r\nbattering-ram? If they don't answer our summons by pulling back the\r\nbolts, then we set fire to the woodwork, and the smoke will choke 'em. Ye\r\ngods! what a smoke! Pfaugh! Is there never a Samos general will help me\r\nunload my burden?[415]--Ah! it shall not gall my shoulder any more.\r\n(_Tosses down his wood._) Come, brazier, do your duty, make the embers\r\nflare, that I may kindle a brand; I want to be the first to hurl one. Aid\r\nme, heavenly Victory; let us punish for their insolent audacity the women\r\nwho have seized our citadel, and may we raise a trophy of triumph for\r\nsuccess!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN.[416] Oh! my dears, methinks I see fire and smoke; can it\r\nbe a conflagration? Let us hurry all we can. Fly, fly, Nicodicé, ere\r\nCalycé and Crityllé perish in the fire, or are stifled in the smoke\r\nraised by these accursed old men and their pitiless laws. But, great\r\ngods, can it be I come too late? Rising at dawn, I had the utmost trouble\r\nto fill this vessel at the fountain. Oh! what a crowd there was, and what\r\na din! What a rattling of water-pots! Servants and slave-girls pushed and\r\nthronged me! However, here I have it full at last; and I am running to\r\ncarry the water to my fellow townswomen, whom our foes are plotting to\r\nburn alive. News has been brought us that a company of old, doddering\r\ngreybeards, loaded with enormous faggots, as if they wanted to heat a\r\nfurnace, have taken the field, vomiting dreadful threats, crying that\r\nthey must reduce to ashes these horrible women. Suffer them not, oh!\r\ngoddess, but, of thy grace, may I see Athens and Greece cured of their\r\nwarlike folly. 'Tis to this end, oh! thou guardian deity of our city,\r\ngoddess of the golden crest, that they have seized thy sanctuary. Be\r\ntheir friend and ally, Athené, and if any man hurl against them lighted\r\nfirebrands, aid us to carry water to extinguish them.\r\n\r\nSTRATYLLIS. Let me be, I say. Oh! oh! (_She calls for help._)\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What is this I see, ye wretched old men? Honest and\r\npious folk ye cannot be who act so vilely.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah, ha! here's something new! a swarm of women stand\r\nposted outside to defend the gates!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ah! ah! we frighten you, do we; we seem a mighty host,\r\nyet you do not see the ten-thousandth part of our sex.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ho, Phaedrias! shall we stop their cackle? Suppose one\r\nof us were to break a stick across their backs, eh?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Let us set down our water-pots on the ground, to be out\r\nof the way, if they should dare to offer us violence.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Let someone knock out two or three teeth for them, as\r\nthey did to Bupalus;[417] they won't talk so loud then.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Come on then; I wait you with unflinching foot, and I\r\nwill snap off your testicles like a bitch.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Silence! ere my stick has cut short your days.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Now, just you dare to touch Stratyllis with the tip of\r\nyour finger!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. And if I batter you to pieces with my fists, what will\r\nyou do?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I will tear out your lungs and entrails with my teeth.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh! what a clever poet is Euripides! how well he says\r\nthat woman is the most shameless of animals.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Let's pick up our water-jars again, Rhodippé.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! accursed harlot, what do you mean to do here with\r\nyour water?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And you, old death-in-life, with your fire? Is it to\r\ncremate yourself?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I am going to build you a pyre to roast your female\r\nfriends upon.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And I,--I am going to put out your fire.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. You put out my fire--you!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Yes, you shall soon see.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I don't know what prevents me from roasting you with\r\nthis torch.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I am getting you a bath ready to clean off the filth.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. A bath for me, you dirty slut, you!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Yes, indeed, a nuptial bath--he, he!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Do you hear that? What insolence!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I am a free woman, I tell you.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I will make you hold your tongue, never fear!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ah, ha! you shall never sit more amongst the\r\nheliasts.[418]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Burn off her hair for her!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Water, do your office! (_The women pitch the water in\r\ntheir water-pots over the old men._)\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Was it hot?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Hot, great gods! Enough, enough!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I'm watering you, to make you bloom afresh.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Alas! I am too dry! Ah, me! how I am trembling with\r\ncold!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. These women, have they made din enough, I wonder, with their\r\ntambourines? bewept Adonis enough upon their terraces?[419] I was\r\nlistening to the speeches last assembly day,[420] and Demostratus,[421]\r\nwhom heaven confound! was saying we must all go over to Sicily--and lo!\r\nhis wife was dancing round repeating: Alas! alas! Adonis, woe is me for\r\nAdonis!\r\n\r\nDemostratus was saying we must levy hoplites at Zacynthus[422]--and lo!\r\nhis wife, more than half drunk, was screaming on the house-roof: \"Weep,\r\nweep for Adonis!\"--while that infamous _Mad Ox_[423] was bellowing away\r\non his side.--Do ye not blush, ye women, for your wild and uproarious\r\ndoings?\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. But you don't know all their effrontery yet! They\r\nabused and insulted us; then soused us with the water in their\r\nwater-pots, and have set us wringing out our clothes, for all the world\r\nas if we had bepissed ourselves.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. And 'tis well done too, by Poseidon! We men must share the\r\nblame of their ill conduct; it is we who teach them to love riot and\r\ndissoluteness and sow the seeds of wickedness in their hearts. You see a\r\nhusband go into a shop: \"Look you, jeweller,\" says he, \"you remember the\r\nnecklace you made for my wife. Well, t'other evening, when she was\r\ndancing, the catch came open. Now, I am bound to start for Salamis; will\r\nyou make it convenient to go up to-night to make her fastening secure?\"\r\nAnother will go to a cobbler, a great, strong fellow, with a great, long\r\ntool, and tell him: \"The strap of one of my wife's sandals presses her\r\nlittle toe, which is extremely sensitive; come in about midday to supple\r\nthe thing and stretch it.\" Now see the results. Take my own case--as a\r\nMagistrate I have enlisted rowers; I want money to pay 'em, and lo! the\r\nwomen clap to the door in my face.[424] But why do we stand here with\r\narms crossed? Bring me a crowbar; I'll chastise their insolence!--Ho!\r\nthere, my fine fellow! (_addressing one of his attendant officers_) what\r\nare you gaping at the crows about? looking for a tavern, I suppose, eh?\r\nCome, crowbars here, and force open the gates. I will put a hand to the\r\nwork myself.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. No need to force the gates; I am coming out--here I am. And\r\nwhy bolts and bars? What we want here is not bolts and bars and locks,\r\nbut common sense.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Really, my fine lady! Where is my officer? I want him to tie\r\nthat woman's hands behind her back.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. By Artemis, the virgin goddess! if he touches me with the tip\r\nof his finger, officer of the public peace though he be, let him look out\r\nfor himself!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE (_to the officer_). How now, are you afraid? Seize her, I tell\r\nyou, round the body. Two of you at her, and have done with it!\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. By Pandrosos! if you lay a hand on her, I'll trample you\r\nunderfoot till you shit your guts!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Oh, there! my guts! Where is my other officer? Bind that minx\r\nfirst, who speaks so prettily!\r\n\r\nSECOND WOMAN. By Phoebé, if you touch her with one finger, you'd better\r\ncall quick for a surgeon!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. What do you mean? Officer, where are you got to? Lay hold of\r\nher. Oh! but I'm going to stop your foolishness for you all!\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. By the Tauric Artemis, if you go near her, I'll pull out\r\nyour hair, scream as you like.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Ah! miserable man that I am! My own officers desert me. What\r\nho! are we to let ourselves be bested by a mob of women? Ho! Scythians\r\nmine, close up your ranks, and forward!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. By the holy goddesses! you'll have to make acquaintance with\r\nfour companies of women, ready for the fray and well armed to boot.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Forward, Scythians, and bind them!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Forward, my gallant companions; march forth, ye vendors of\r\ngrain and eggs, garlic and vegetables, keepers of taverns and bakeries,\r\nwrench and strike and tear; come, a torrent of invective and insult!\r\n(_They beat the officers._) Enough, enough! now retire, never rob the\r\nvanquished!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Here's a fine exploit for my officers!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ah, ha! so you thought you had only to do with a set of\r\nslave-women! you did not know the ardour that fills the bosom of\r\nfree-born dames.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Ardour! yes, by Apollo, ardour enough--especially for the\r\nwine-cup!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Sir, sir! what use of words? they are of no avail with\r\nwild beasts of this sort. Don't you know how they have just washed us\r\ndown--and with no very fragrant soap!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What would you have? You should never have laid rash\r\nhands on us. If you start afresh, I'll knock your eyes out. My delight is\r\nto stay at home as coy as a young maid, without hurting anybody or moving\r\nany more than a milestone; but 'ware the wasps, if you go stirring up the\r\nwasps' nest!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! great gods! how get the better of these ferocious\r\ncreatures? 'tis past all bearing! But come, let us try to find out the\r\nreason of the dreadful scourge. With what end in view have they seized\r\nthe citadel of Cranaus,[425] the sacred shrine that is raised upon the\r\ninaccessible rock of the Acropolis? Question them; be cautious and not\r\ntoo credulous. 'Twould be culpable negligence not to pierce the mystery,\r\nif we may.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE (_addressing the women_). I would ask you first why ye have\r\nbarred our gates.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. To seize the treasury; no more money, no more war.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Then money is the cause of the War?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And of all our troubles. 'Twas to find occasion to steal that\r\nPisander[426] and all the other agitators were for ever raising\r\nrevolutions. Well and good! but they'll never get another drachma here.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. What do you propose to do then, pray?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. You ask me that! Why, we propose to administer the treasury\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. _You_ do?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What is there in that to surprise you? Do we not administer\r\nthe budget of household expenses?\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But that is not the same thing.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA How so--not the same thing?\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. It is the treasury supplies the expenses of the War.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. That's our first principle--no War!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. What! and the safety of the city?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. We will provide for that.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE You?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA Yes, just we.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. What a sorry business!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, we're going to save you, whether you will or no.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Oh! the impudence of the creatures!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. You seem annoyed! but there, you've got to come to it.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But 'tis the very height of iniquity!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. We're going to save you, my man.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But if I don't want to be saved?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Why, all the more reason!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But what a notion, to concern yourselves with questions of\r\nPeace and War!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. We will explain our idea.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Out with it then; quick, or ... (_threatening her_).\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Listen, and never a movement, please!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Oh! it is too much for me! I cannot keep my temper!\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. Then look out for yourself; you have more to fear than we have.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Stop your croaking, old crow, you! (_To Lysistrata._) Now\r\nyou, say your say.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Willingly. All the long time the War has lasted, we have\r\nendured in modest silence all you men did; we never allowed ourselves to\r\nopen our lips. We were far from satisfied, for we knew how things were\r\ngoing; often in our homes we would hear you discussing, upside down and\r\ninside out, some important turn of affairs. Then with sad hearts, but\r\nsmiling lips, we would ask you: Well, in to-day's Assembly did they vote\r\nPeace?--But, \"Mind your own business!\" the husband would growl, \"Hold\r\nyour tongue, do!\" And I would say no more.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. I would not have held my tongue though, not I!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. You would have been reduced to silence by blows then.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Well, for my part, I would say no more. But presently I would\r\ncome to know you had arrived at some fresh decision more fatally foolish\r\nthan ever. \"Ah! my dear man,\" I would say, \"what madness next!\" But he\r\nwould only look at me askance and say: \"Just weave your web, do; else\r\nyour cheeks will smart for hours. War is men's business!\"\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Bravo! well said indeed!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. How now, wretched man? not to let us contend against your\r\nfollies, was bad enough! But presently we heard you asking out loud in\r\nthe open street: \"Is there never a man left in Athens?\" and, \"No, not\r\none, not one,\" you were assured in reply. Then, then we made up our minds\r\nwithout more delay to make common cause to save Greece. Open your ears to\r\nour wise counsels and hold your tongues, and we may yet put things on a\r\nbetter footing.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. _You_ put things indeed! Oh! 'tis too much! The insolence of\r\nthe creatures! Silence, I say.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Silence yourself!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. May I die a thousand deaths ere I obey one who wears a veil!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. If that's all that troubles you, here, take my veil, wrap it\r\nround your head, and hold your tongue. Then take this basket; put on a\r\ngirdle, card wool, munch beans. The War shall be women's business.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Lay aside your water-pots, we will guard them, we will\r\nhelp our friends and companions. For myself, I will never weary of the\r\ndance; my knees will never grow stiff with fatigue. I will brave\r\neverything with my dear allies, on whom Nature has lavished virtue,\r\ngrace, boldness, cleverness, and whose wisely directed energy is going to\r\nsave the State. Oh! my good, gallant Lysistrata, and all my friends, be\r\never like a bundle of nettles; never let your anger slacken; the winds of\r\nfortune blow our way.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. May gentle Love and the sweet Cyprian Queen shower seductive\r\ncharms on our bosoms and all our person. If only we may stir so amorous a\r\nlust among the men that their tools stand stiff as sticks, we shall\r\nindeed deserve the name of peace-makers among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. How will that be, pray?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. To begin with, we shall not see you any more running like mad\r\nfellows to the Market holding lance in fist.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. That will be something gained, anyway, by the Paphian goddess,\r\nit will!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Now we see 'em, mixed up with saucepans and kitchen stuff,\r\narmed to the teeth, looking like wild Corybantes![427]\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Why, of course; that's how brave men should do.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! but what a funny sight, to behold a man wearing a\r\nGorgon's-head buckler coming along to buy fish!\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. 'Tother day in the Market I saw a phylarch[428] with flowing\r\nringlets; he was a-horseback, and was pouring into his helmet the broth\r\nhe had just bought at an old dame's stall. There was a Thracian warrior\r\ntoo, who was brandishing his lance like Tereus in the play;[429] he had\r\nscared a good woman selling figs into a perfect panic, and was gobbling\r\nup all her ripest fruit.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. And how, pray, would you propose to restore peace and order\r\nin all the countries of Greece?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. 'Tis the easiest thing in the world!\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Come, tell us how; I am curious to know.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. When we are winding thread, and it is tangled, we pass the\r\nspool across and through the skein, now this way, now that way; even so,\r\nto finish off the War, we shall send embassies hither and thither and\r\neverywhere, to disentangle matters.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. And 'tis with your yarn, and your skeins, and your spools,\r\nyou think to appease so many bitter enmities, you silly women?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. If only you had common sense, you would always do in politics\r\nthe same as we do with our yarn.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Come, how is that, eh?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. First we wash the yarn to separate the grease and filth; do\r\nthe same with all bad citizens, sort them out and drive them forth with\r\nrods--'tis the refuse of the city. Then for all such as come crowding up\r\nin search of employments and offices, we must card them thoroughly; then,\r\nto bring them all to the same standard, pitch them pell-mell into the\r\nsame basket, resident aliens or no, allies, debtors to the State, all\r\nmixed up together. Then as for our Colonies, you must think of them as so\r\nmany isolated hanks; find the ends of the separate threads, draw them to\r\na centre here, wind them into one, make one great hank of the lot, out of\r\nwhich the Public can weave itself a good, stout tunic.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Is it not a sin and a shame to see them carding and winding\r\nthe State, these women who have neither art nor part in the burdens of\r\nthe War?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What! wretched man! why, 'tis a far heavier burden to us than\r\nto you. In the first place, we bear sons who go off to fight far away\r\nfrom Athens.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Enough said! do not recall sad and sorry memories![430]\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then secondly, instead of enjoying the pleasures of love and\r\nmaking the best of our youth and beauty, we are left to languish far from\r\nour husbands, who are all with the army. But say no more of ourselves;\r\nwhat afflicts me is to see our girls growing old in lonely grief.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Don't the men grow old too?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. That is not the same thing. When the soldier returns from the\r\nwars, even though he has white hair, he very soon finds a young wife. But\r\na woman has only one summer; if she does not make hay while the sun\r\nshines, no one will afterwards have anything to say to her, and she\r\nspends her days consulting oracles, that never send her a husband.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But the old man who can still erect his organ ...\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. But you, why don't you get done with it and die? You are\r\nrich; go buy yourself a bier, and I will knead you a honey-cake for\r\nCerberus. Here, take this garland. (_Drenching him with water._)\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. And this one too. (_Drenching him with water._)\r\n\r\nSECOND WOMAN. And these fillets. (_Drenching him with water._)\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What do you lack more? Step aboard the boat; Charon is\r\nwaiting for you, you're keeping him from pushing off.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. To treat me so scurvily! What an insult! I will go show\r\nmyself to my fellow-magistrates just as I am.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What! are you blaming us for not having exposed you according\r\nto custom?[431] Nay, console yourself; we will not fail to offer up the\r\nthird-day sacrifice for you, first thing in the morning.[432]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Awake, friends of freedom; let us hold ourselves aye\r\nready to act. I suspect a mighty peril; I foresee another Tyranny like\r\nHippias'.[433] I am sore afraid the Laconians assembled here with\r\nCleisthenes have, by a stratagem of war, stirred up these women, enemies\r\nof the gods, to seize upon our treasury and the funds whereby I\r\nlived.[434] Is it not a sin and a shame for them to interfere in advising\r\nthe citizens, to prate of shields and lances, and to ally themselves with\r\nLaconians, fellows I trust no more than I would so many famished wolves?\r\nThe whole thing, my friends, is nothing else but an attempt to\r\nre-establish Tyranny. But I will never submit; I will be on my guard for\r\nthe future; I will always carry a blade hidden under myrtle boughs; I\r\nwill post myself in the Public Square under arms, shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith Aristogiton;[435] and now, to make a start, I must just break a few\r\nof that cursed old jade's teeth yonder.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Nay, never play the brave man, else when you go back\r\nhome, your own mother won't know you. But, dear friends and allies, first\r\nlet us lay our burdens down; then, citizens all, hear what I have to say.\r\nI have useful counsel to give our city, which deserves it well at my\r\nhands for the brilliant distinctions it has lavished on my girlhood. At\r\nseven years of age, I was bearer of the sacred vessels; at ten, I pounded\r\nbarley for the altar of Athené; next, clad in a robe of yellow silk, I\r\nwas _little bear_ to Artemis at the Brauronia;[436] presently, grown a\r\ntall, handsome maiden, they put a necklace of dried figs about my neck,\r\nand I was Basket-Bearer.[437] So surely I am bound to give my best advice\r\nto Athens. What matters that I was born a woman, if I can cure your\r\nmisfortunes? I pay my share of tolls and taxes, by giving men to the\r\nState. But you, you miserable greybeards, you contribute nothing to the\r\npublic charges; on the contrary, you have wasted the treasure of our\r\nforefathers, as it was called, the treasure amassed in the days of the\r\nPersian Wars.[438] You pay nothing at all in return; and into the bargain\r\nyou endanger our lives and liberties by your mistakes. Have you one word\r\nto say for yourselves? ... Ah! don't irritate me, you there, or I'll lay\r\nmy slipper across your jaws; and it's pretty heavy.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Outrage upon outrage! things are going from bad to\r\nworse. Let us punish the minxes, every one of us that has a man's\r\nappendages to boast of. Come, off with our tunics, for a man must savour\r\nof manhood; come, my friends, let us strip naked from head to foot.\r\nCourage, I say, we who in our day garrisoned Lipsydrion;[439] let us be\r\nyoung again, and shake off eld. If we give them the least hold over us,\r\n'tis all up! their audacity will know no bounds! We shall see them\r\nbuilding ships, and fighting sea-fights, like Artemisia;[440] nay, if\r\nthey want to mount and ride as cavalry, we had best cashier the knights,\r\nfor indeed women excel in riding, and have a fine, firm seat for the\r\ngallop.[441] Just think of all those squadrons of Amazons Micon has\r\npainted for us engaged in hand-to-hand combat with men.[442] Come then,\r\nwe must e'en fit collars to all these willing necks.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. By the blessed goddesses, if you anger me, I will let\r\nloose the beast of my evil passions, and a very hailstorm of blows will\r\nset you yelling for help. Come, dames, off tunics, and quick's the word;\r\nwomen must scent the savour of women in the throes of passion.... Now\r\njust you dare to measure strength with me, old greybeard, and I warrant\r\nyou you'll never eat garlic or black beans more. No, not a word! my anger\r\nis at boiling point, and I'll do with you what the beetle did with the\r\neagle's eggs.[443] I laugh at your threats, so long as I have on my side\r\nLampito here, and the noble Theban, my dear Ismenia.... Pass decree on\r\ndecree, you can do us no hurt, you wretch abhorred of all your fellows.\r\nWhy, only yesterday, on occasion of the feast of Hecaté, I asked my\r\nneighbours of Boeotia for one of their daughters for whom my girls have a\r\nlively liking--a fine, fat eel to wit; and if they did not refuse, all\r\nalong of your silly decrees! We shall never cease to suffer the like,\r\ntill someone gives you a neat trip-up and breaks your neck for you!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN (_addressing Lysistrata_). You, Lysistrata, you who are\r\nleader of our glorious enterprise, why do I see you coming towards me\r\nwith so gloomy an air?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. 'Tis the behaviour of these naughty women, 'tis the female\r\nheart and female weakness so discourages me.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Tell us, tell us, what is it?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. I only tell the simple truth.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What has happened so disconcerting; come, tell your\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Oh! the thing is so hard to tell--yet so impossible to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Nay, never seek to hide any ill that has befallen our\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. To blurt it out in a word--we are in heat!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Oh! Zeus, oh! Zeus!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What use calling upon Zeus? The thing is even as I say. I\r\ncannot stop them any longer from lusting after the men. They are all for\r\ndeserting. The first I caught was slipping out by the postern gate near\r\nthe cave of Pan; another was letting herself down by a rope and pulley; a\r\nthird was busy preparing her escape; while a fourth, perched on a bird's\r\nback, was just taking wing for Orsilochus' house,[444] when I seized her\r\nby the hair. One and all, they are inventing excuses to be off home.\r\nLook! there goes one, trying to get out! Halloa there! whither away so\r\nfast?\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. I want to go home; I have some Miletus wool in the house,\r\nwhich is getting all eaten up by the worms.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Bah! you and your worms! go back, I say!\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. I will return immediately, I swear I will by the two\r\ngoddesses! I only have just to spread it out on the bed.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. You shall not do anything of the kind! I say, you shall not\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. Must I leave my wool to spoil then?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, if need be.\r\n\r\nSECOND WOMAN. Unhappy woman that I am! Alas for my flax! I've left it at\r\nhome unstript!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. So, here's another trying to escape to go home and strip her\r\nflax forsooth!\r\n\r\nSECOND WOMAN. Oh! I swear by the goddess of light, the instant I have put\r\nit in condition I will come straight back.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. You shall do nothing of the kind! If once you began, others\r\nwould want to follow suit.\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. Oh! goddess divine, Ilithyia, patroness of women in labour,\r\nstay, stay the birth, till I have reached a spot less hallowed than\r\nAthene's Mount!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What mean you by these silly tales?\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. I am going to have a child--now, this minute.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. But you were not pregnant yesterday!\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. Well, I am to-day. Oh! let me go in search of the midwife,\r\nLysistrata, quick, quick!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What is this fable you are telling me? Ah! what have you got\r\nthere so hard?\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. A male child.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. No, no, by Aphrodité! nothing of the sort! Why, it feels like\r\nsomething hollow--a pot or a kettle. Oh! you baggage, if you have not got\r\nthe sacred helmet of Pallas--and you said you were with child!\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. And so I am, by Zeus, I am!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Then why this helmet, pray?\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. For fear my pains should seize me in the Acropolis; I mean\r\nto lay my eggs in this helmet, as the doves do.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Excuses and pretences every word! the thing's as clear as\r\ndaylight. Anyway, you must stay here now till the fifth day, your day of\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nTHIRD WOMAN. I cannot sleep any more in the Acropolis, now I have seen\r\nthe snake that guards the Temple.\r\n\r\nFOURTH WOMAN. Ah! and those confounded owls with their dismal hooting! I\r\ncannot get a wink of rest, and I'm just dying of fatigue.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. You wicked women, have done with your falsehoods! You want\r\nyour husbands, that's plain enough. But don't you think they want you\r\njust as badly? They are spending dreadful nights, oh! I know that well\r\nenough. But hold out, my dears, hold out! A little more patience, and the\r\nvictory will be ours. An Oracle promises us success, if only we remain\r\nunited. Shall I repeat the words?\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. Yes, tell us what the Oracle declares.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Silence then! Now--\"Whenas the swallows, fleeing before the\r\nhoopoes, shall have all flocked together in one place, and shall refrain\r\nthem from all amorous commerce, then will be the end of all the ills of\r\nlife; yea, and Zeus, which doth thunder in the skies, shall set above\r\nwhat was erst below....\"\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. What! shall the men be underneath?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. \"But if dissension do arise among the swallows, and they take\r\nwing from the holy Temple, 'twill be said there is never a more wanton\r\nbird in all the world.\"\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Ye gods! the prophecy is clear. Nay, never let us be\r\ncast down by calamity! let us be brave to bear, and go back to our posts.\r\n'Twere shameful indeed not to trust the promises of the Oracle.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. I want to tell you a fable they used to relate to me\r\nwhen I was a little boy. This is it: Once upon a time there was a young\r\nman called Melanion, who hated the thought of marriage so sorely that he\r\nfled away to the wilds. So he dwelt in the mountains, wove himself nets,\r\nkept a dog and caught hares. He never, never came back, he had such a\r\nhorror of women. As chaste as Melanion,[445] we loathe the jades just as\r\nmuch as he did.\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN. You dear old woman, I would fain kiss you.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. I will set you crying without onions.\r\n\r\nOLD MAN. ... And give you a sound kicking.\r\n\r\nOLD WOMAN. Ah, ha! what a dense forest you have there! (_Pointing._)\r\n\r\nOLD MAN. So was Myronides one of the best-bearded of men o' this side;\r\nhis backside was all black, and he terrified his enemies as much as\r\nPhormio.[446]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I want to tell you a fable too, to match yours about\r\nMelanion. Once there was a certain man called Timon,[447] a tough\r\ncustomer, and a whimsical, a true son of the Furies, with a face that\r\nseemed to glare out of a thorn-bush. He withdrew from the world because\r\nhe couldn't abide bad men, after vomiting a thousand curses at 'em. He\r\nhad a holy horror of ill-conditioned fellows, but he was mighty tender\r\ntowards women.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. Suppose I up and broke your jaw for you!\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN. I am not a bit afraid of you.\r\n\r\nA WOMAN. Suppose I let fly a good kick at you?\r\n\r\nOLD MAN. I should see your backside then.\r\n\r\nWOMAN. You would see that, for all my age, it is very well attended to,\r\nand all fresh singed smooth.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ho there! come quick, come quick!\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. What is it? Why these cries?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. A man! a man! I see him approaching all afire with the flames\r\nof love. Oh! divine Queen of Cyprus, Paphos and Cythera, I pray you still\r\nbe propitious to our emprise.\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. Where is he, this unknown foe?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yonder--beside the Temple of Demeter.\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. Yes, indeed, I see him; but who is it?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Look, look! does any of you recognize him?\r\n\r\nFIRST WOMAN. I do, I do! 'tis my husband Cinesias.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. To work then! Be it your task to inflame and torture and\r\ntorment him. Seductions, caresses, provocations, refusals, try every\r\nmeans! Grant every favour,--always excepting what is forbidden by our\r\noath on the wine-bowl.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Have no fear, I undertake the work.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Well, I will stay here to help you cajole the man and set his\r\npassions aflame. The rest of you, withdraw.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Alas! alas! how I am tortured by spasm and rigid convulsion!\r\nOh! I am racked on the wheel!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Who is this that dares to pass our lines?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. It is I.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What, a man?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Yes, no doubt about it, a man!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Begone!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. But who are you that thus repulses me?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. The sentinel of the day.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. By all the gods, call Myrrhiné hither.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Call Myrrhiné hither, quotha? And pray, who are you?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I am her husband, Cinesias, son of Peon.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ah! good day, my dear friend. Your name is not unknown\r\namongst us. Your wife has it for ever on her lips; and she never touches\r\nan egg or an apple without saying: \"'Twill be for Cinesias.\"\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Really and truly?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Yes, indeed, by Aphrodité! And if we fall to talking of men,\r\nquick your wife declares: \"Oh! all the rest, they're good for nothing\r\ncompared with Cinesias.\"\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! I beseech you, go and call her to me.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And what will you give me for my trouble?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS.\r\n\r\nThis, if you like (_handling his tool_). I will give you what I have\r\nthere!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Well, well, I will tell her to come.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Quick, oh! be quick! Life has no more charms for me since she\r\nleft my house. I am sad, sad, when I go indoors; it all seems so empty;\r\nmy victuals have lost their savour. Desire is eating out my heart!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. I love him, oh! I love him; but he won't let himself be loved.\r\nNo! I shall not come.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Myrrhiné, my little darling Myrrhiné, what are you saying? Come\r\ndown to me quick.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No indeed, not I.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I call you, Myrrhiné, Myrrhiné; will you not come?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Why should you call me? You do not want me.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Not want you! Why, my weapon stands stiff with desire!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Good-bye.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! Myrrhiné, Myrrhiné, in our child's name, hear me; at any\r\nrate hear the child! Little lad, call your mother.\r\n\r\nCHILD. Mammy, mammy, mammy!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. There, listen! Don't you pity the poor child? It's six days now\r\nyou've never washed and never fed the child.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Poor darling, your father takes mighty little care of you!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Come down, dearest, come down for the child's sake.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Ah! what a thing it is to be a mother! Well, well, we must come\r\ndown, I suppose.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Why, how much younger and prettier she looks! And how she looks\r\nat me so lovingly! Her cruelty and scorn only redouble my passion.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. You are as sweet as your father is provoking! Let me kiss you,\r\nmy treasure, mother's darling!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Ah! what a bad thing it is to let yourself be led away by other\r\nwomen! Why give me such pain and suffering, and yourself into the\r\nbargain?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Hands off, sir!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Everything is going to rack and ruin in the house.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. I don't care.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. But your web that's all being pecked to pieces by the cocks and\r\nhens, don't you care for that?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Precious little.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. And Aphrodite, whose mysteries you have not celebrated for so\r\nlong? Oh! won't you come back home?\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No, at least, not till a sound Treaty put an end to the War.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Well, if you wish it so much, why, we'll make it, your Treaty.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Well and good! When that's done, I will come home. Till then, I\r\nam bound by an oath.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. At any rate, let's have a short time together.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No, no, no! ... all the same I cannot say I don't love you.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. You love me? Then why refuse what I ask, my little girl, my\r\nsweet Myrrhiné.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. You must be joking! What, before the child!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Manes, carry the lad home. There, you see, the child is gone;\r\nthere's nothing to hinder us; let us to work!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. But, miserable man, where, where are we to do it?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. In the cave of Pan; nothing could be better.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. But how to purify myself, before going back into the citadel?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Nothing easier! you can wash at the Clepsydra.[448]\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. But my oath? Do you want me to perjure myself?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I take all responsibility; never make yourself anxious.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Well, I'll be off, then, and find a bed for us.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! 'tis not worth while; we can lie on the ground surely.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No, no! bad man as you are, I don't like your lying on the bare\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Ah! how the dear girl loves me!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a bed_). Come, get to bed quick; I am going\r\nto undress. But, plague take it, we must get a mattress.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. A mattress! Oh! no, never mind!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. No, by Artemis! lie on the bare sacking, never! That were too\r\nsqualid.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. A kiss!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Wait a minute!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! by the great gods, be quick back!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a mattress_). Here is a mattress. Lie down, I\r\nam just going to undress. But, but you've got no pillow.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I don't want one, no, no.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. But _I_ do.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! dear, oh, dear! they treat my poor penis for all the world\r\nlike Heracles.[449]\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a pillow_). There, lift your head, dear!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. That's really everything.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Is it everything, I wonder.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Come, my treasure.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. I am just unfastening my girdle. But remember what you promised\r\nme about making Peace; mind you keep your word.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Yes, yes, upon my life I will.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Why, you have no blanket.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Great Zeus! what matter of that? 'tis you I want to fuck.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ Never fear--directly, directly! I'll be back in no time.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. The woman will kill me with her blankets!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a blanket_). Now, get up for one moment.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. But I tell you, our friend here is up--all stiff and ready!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Would you like me to scent you?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. No, by Apollo, no, please!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Yes, by Aphrodité, but I will, whether you wish it or no.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Ah! great Zeus, may she soon be done!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with a flask of perfume_). Hold out your hand; now\r\nrub it in.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Oh! in Apollo's name, I don't much like the smell of it; but\r\nperhaps 'twill improve when it's well rubbed in. It does not somehow\r\nsmack of the marriage bed!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. There, what a scatterbrain I am; if I have not brought Rhodian\r\nperfumes![450]\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Never mind, dearest, let be now.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. You are joking!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Deuce take the man who first invented perfumes, say I!\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ (_coming back with another flask_). Here, take this bottle.\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I have a better all ready for your service, darling. Come, you\r\nprovoking creature, to bed with you, and don't bring another thing.\r\n\r\nMYRRHINÉ. Coming, coming; I'm just slipping off my shoes. Dear boy, will\r\nyou vote for peace?\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. I'll think about it. (_Myrrhiné runs away._) I'm a dead man,\r\nshe is killing me! She has gone, and left me in torment! I must have\r\nsomeone to fuck, I must! Ah me! the loveliest of women has choused and\r\ncheated me. Poor little lad (_addressing his penis_), how am I to give\r\nyou what you want so badly? Where is Cynalopex? quick, man, get him a\r\nnurse, do![451]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Poor, miserable wretch, baulked in your amorousness!\r\nwhat tortures are yours! Ah! you fill me with pity. Could any man's back\r\nand loins stand such a strain? His organ stands stiff and rigid, and\r\nthere's never a wench to help him!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Ye gods in heaven, what pains I suffer!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Well, there it is; 'tis her doing, that abandoned\r\nhussy!\r\n\r\nCINESIAS. Nay, nay! rather say that sweetest, dearest darling.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. That dearest darling? no, no, that hussy, say I! Zeus,\r\nthou god of the skies, canst not let loose a hurricane, to sweep them all\r\nup into the air, and whirl 'em round, then drop 'em down crash! and\r\nimpale them on the point of his weapon!\r\n\r\nA HERALD. Say, where shall I find the Senate and the Prytanes? I am\r\nbearer of despatches.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But are you a man or a Priapus, pray?[452]\r\n\r\nHERALD. Oh! but he's mighty simple. I am a herald, of course, I swear I\r\nam, and I come from Sparta about making peace.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But look, you are hiding a lance under your clothes, surely.\r\n\r\nHERALD. No, nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Then why do you turn away like that, and hold your cloak out\r\nfrom your body? Have you gotten swellings in the groin with your journey?\r\n\r\nHERALD. By the twin brethren! the man's an old maniac.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Ah, ha! my fine lad, why I can see it standing, oh fie!\r\n\r\nHERALD. I tell you no! but enough of this foolery.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Well, what is it you have there then?\r\n\r\nHERALD. A Lacedaemonian 'skytalé.'[453]\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Oh, indeed, a 'skytalé,' is it? Well, well, speak out\r\nfrankly; I know all about these matters. How are things going at Sparta\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nHERALD. Why, everything is turned upside down at Sparta; and all the\r\nallies are half dead with lusting. We simply must have Pellené.[454]\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. What is the reason of it all? Is it the god Pan's doing?\r\n\r\nHERALD. No, but Lampito's and the Spartan women's, acting at her\r\ninstigation; they have denied the men all access to their cunts.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. But whatever do you do?\r\n\r\nHERALD. We are at our wits' end; we walk bent double, just as if we were\r\ncarrying lanterns in a wind. The jades have sworn we shall not so much as\r\ntouch their cunts till we have all agreed to conclude peace.\r\n\r\nMAGISTRATE. Ha, ha! So I see now, 'tis a general conspiracy embracing all\r\nGreece. Go you back to Sparta and bid them send Envoys with plenary\r\npowers to treat for peace. I will urge our Senators myself to name\r\nPlenipotentiaries from us; and to persuade them, why, I will show them\r\nthis. (_Pointing to his erect penis._)\r\n\r\nHERALD. What could be better? I fly at your command.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. No wild beast is there, no flame of fire, more fierce\r\nand untameable than woman; the panther is less savage and shameless.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. And yet you dare to make war upon me, wretch, when you\r\nmight have me for your most faithful friend and ally.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Never, never can my hatred cease towards women.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Well, please yourself. Still I cannot bear to leave you\r\nall naked as you are; folks would laugh at me. Come, I am going to put\r\nthis tunic on you.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. You are right, upon my word! it was only in my\r\nconfounded fit of rage I took it off.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Now at any rate you look like a man, and they won't make\r\nfun of you. Ah! if you had not offended me so badly, I would take out\r\nthat nasty insect you have in your eye for you.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! so that's what was annoying me so! Look, here's a\r\nring, just remove the insect, and show it me. By Zeus! it has been\r\nhurting my eye this ever so long.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Well, I agree, though your manners are not over and\r\nabove pleasant. Oh! what a huge great gnat! just look! It's from\r\nTricorysus, for sure.[455]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. A thousand thanks! the creature was digging a regular\r\nwell in my eye; now it's gone, my tears flow freely.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. I will wipe them for you--bad, naughty man though you\r\nare. Now, just one kiss.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. No--a kiss, certainly not!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Just one, whether you like it or not.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Oh! those confounded women! how they do cajole us! How\r\ntrue the saying: \"'Tis impossible to live with the baggages, impossible\r\nto live without 'em\"! Come, let us agree for the future not to regard\r\neach other any more as enemies; and to clinch the bargain, let us sing a\r\nchoric song.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. We desire, Athenians, to speak ill of no man; but on the\r\ncontrary to say much good of everyone, and to _do_ the like. We have had\r\nenough of misfortunes and calamities. Is there any, man or woman, wants a\r\nbit of money--two or three minas or so;[456] well, our purse is full. If\r\nonly peace is concluded, the borrower will not have to pay back. Also I'm\r\ninviting to supper a few Carystian friends,[457] who are excellently well\r\nqualified. I have still a drop of good soup left, and a young porker I'm\r\ngoing to kill, and the flesh will be sweet and tender. I shall expect you\r\nat my house to-day; but first away to the baths with you, you and your\r\nchildren; then come all of you, ask no one's leave, but walk straight up,\r\nas if you were at home; never fear, the door will be ... shut in your\r\nfaces![458]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! here come the Envoys from Sparta with their long\r\nflowing beards; why, you would think they wore a cage[459] between their\r\nthighs. (_Enter the Lacedaemonian Envoys._) Hail to you, first of all,\r\nLaconians; then tell us how you fare.\r\n\r\nA LACONIAN. No need for many words; you see what a state we are in.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Alas! the situation grows more and more strained! the\r\nintensity of the thing is just frightful.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. 'Tis beyond belief. But to work! summon your Commissioners, and\r\nlet us patch up the best peace we may.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Ah! our men too, like wrestlers in the arena, cannot\r\nendure a rag over their bellies; 'tis an athlete's malady, which only\r\nexercise can remedy.\r\n\r\nAN ATHENIAN. Can anybody tell us where Lysistrata is? Surely she will\r\nhave some compassion on our condition.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Look! 'tis the very same complaint. (_Addressing the\r\nAthenian._) Don't you feel of mornings a strong nervous tension?\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Yes, and a dreadful, dreadful torture it is! Unless peace is\r\nmade very soon, we shall find no resource but to fuck Clisthenes.[460]\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Take my advice, and put on your clothes again; one of\r\nthe fellows who mutilated the Hermae[461] might see you.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. You are right.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. Quite right. There, I will slip on my tunic.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Oh! what a terrible state we are in! Greeting to you, Laconian\r\nfellow-sufferers.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN (_addressing one of his countrymen_). Ah! my boy, what a thing\r\nit would have been if these fellows had seen us just now when our tools\r\nwere on full stand!\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Speak out, Laconians, what is it brings you here?\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. We have come to treat for peace.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Well said; we are of the same mind. Better call Lysistrata\r\nthen; she is the only person will bring us to terms.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. Yes, yes--and Lysistratus into the bargain, if you will.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF OLD MEN. Needless to call her; she has heard your voices, and\r\nhere she comes.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Hail, boldest and bravest of womankind! The time is come to\r\nshow yourself in turn uncompromising and conciliatory, exacting and\r\nyielding, haughty and condescending. Call up all your skill and\r\nartfulness. Lo! the foremost men in Hellas, seduced by your fascinations,\r\nare agreed to entrust you with the task of ending their quarrels.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. 'Twill be an easy task--if only they refrain from mutual\r\nindulgence in masculine love; if they do, I shall know the fact at once.\r\nNow, where is the gentle goddess Peace? Lead hither the Laconian Envoys.\r\nBut, look you, no roughness or violence; our husbands always behaved so\r\nboorishly.[462] Bring them to me with smiles, as women should. If any\r\nrefuse to give you his hand, then catch him by the penis and draw him\r\npolitely forward. Bring up the Athenians too; you may take them just how\r\nyou will. Laconians, approach; and you, Athenians, on my other side. Now\r\nhearken all! I am but a woman; but I have good common sense; Nature has\r\ndowered me with discriminating judgment, which I have yet further\r\ndeveloped, thanks to the wise teachings of my father and the elders of\r\nthe city. First I must bring a reproach against you that applies equally\r\nto both sides. At Olympia, and Thermopylae, and Delphi, and a score of\r\nother places too numerous to mention, you celebrate before the same\r\naltars ceremonies common to all Hellenes; yet you go cutting each other's\r\nthroats, and sacking Hellenic cities, when all the while the Barbarian is\r\nyonder threatening you! That is my first point.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Ah, ah! concupiscence is killing me!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Now 'tis to you I address myself, Laconians. Have you\r\nforgotten how Periclides,[463] your own countryman, sat a suppliant\r\nbefore our altars? How pale he was in his purple robes! He had come to\r\ncrave an army of us; 'twas the time when Messenia was pressing you sore,\r\nand the Sea-god was shaking the earth. Cimon marched to your aid at the\r\nhead of four thousand hoplites, and saved Lacedaemon. And, after such a\r\nservice as that, you ravage the soil of your benefactors!\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. They do wrong, very wrong, Lysistrata.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. We do wrong, very wrong. Ah! great gods! what lovely thighs she\r\nhas!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. And now a word to the Athenians. Have you no memory left of\r\nhow, in the days when ye wore the tunic of slaves, the Laconians came,\r\nspear in hand, and slew a host of Thessalians and partisans of Hippias\r\nthe Tyrant? They, and they only, fought on your side on that eventful\r\nday; they delivered you from despotism, and thanks to them our Nation\r\ncould change the short tunic of the slave for the long cloak of the free\r\nman.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. I have never seen a woman of more gracious dignity.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. I have never seen a woman with a finer cunt!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Bound by such ties of mutual kindness, how can you bear to be\r\nat war? Stop, stay the hateful strife, be reconciled; what hinders you?\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. We are quite ready, if they will give us back our rampart.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. What rampart, my dear man?\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. Pylos, which we have been asking for and craving for ever so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. In the Sea-god's name, you shall never have it!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Agree, my friends, agree.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. But then what city shall we be able to stir up trouble in?\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Ask for another place in exchange.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Ah! that's the ticket! Well, to begin with, give us Echinus,\r\nthe Maliac gulf adjoining, and the two legs of Megara.[464]\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. Oh! surely, surely not all that, my dear sir.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Come to terms; never make a difficulty of two legs more or\r\nless!\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Well, I'm ready now to off coat and cultivate my land.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. And I too, to dung it to start with.\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. That's just what you shall do, once peace is signed. So, if\r\nyou really want to make it, go consult your allies about the matter.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. What allies, I should like to know? Why, we are _all_ on the\r\nstand; not one but is mad to be fucking. What we all want, is to be abed\r\nwith our wives; how should our allies fail to second our project?\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. And ours the same, for certain sure!\r\n\r\nATHENIANS. The Carystians first and foremost, by the gods!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. Well said, indeed! Now be off to purify yourselves for\r\nentering the Acropolis, where the women invite you to supper; we will\r\nempty our provision baskets to do you honour. At table, you will exchange\r\noaths and pledges; then each man will go home with his wife.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Come along then, and as quick as may be.\r\n\r\nLACONIAN. Lead on; I'm your man.\r\n\r\nATHENIAN. Quick, quick's the word, say I.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF WOMEN. Embroidered stuffs, and dainty tunics, and flowing\r\ngowns, and golden ornaments, everything I have, I offer them you with all\r\nmy heart; take them all for your children, for your girls, against they\r\nare chosen \"basket-bearers\" to the goddess. I invite you every one to\r\nenter, come in and choose whatever you will; there is nothing so well\r\nfastened, you cannot break the seals, and carry away the contents. Look\r\nabout you everywhere ... you won't find a blessed thing, unless you have\r\nsharper eyes than mine.[465] And if any of you lacks corn to feed his\r\nslaves and his young and numerous family, why, I have a few grains of\r\nwheat at home; let him take what I have to give, a big twelve-pound loaf\r\nincluded. So let my poorer neighbours all come with bags and wallets; my\r\nman, Manes, shall give them corn; but I warn them not to come near my\r\ndoor, or--beware the dog![465]\r\n\r\nA MARKET-LOUNGER. I say, you, open the door!\r\n\r\nA SLAVE. Go your way, I tell you. Why, bless me, they're sitting down\r\nnow; I shall have to singe 'em with my torch to make 'em stir! What an\r\nimpudent lot of fellows!\r\n\r\nMARKET-LOUNGER. I don't mean to budge.\r\n\r\nSLAVE. Well, as you _must_ stop, and I don't want to offend you--but\r\nyou'll see some queer sights.\r\n\r\nMARKET-LOUNGER. Well and good, I've no objection.\r\n\r\nSLAVE. No, no, you must be off--or I'll tear your hair out, I will; be\r\noff, I say, and don't annoy the Laconian Envoys; they're just coming out\r\nfrom the banquet-hall.\r\n\r\nAN ATHENIAN. Such a merry banquet I've never seen before! The Laconians\r\nwere simply charming. After the drink is in, why, we're all wise men,\r\nall. It's only natural, to be sure, for sober, we're all fools. Take my\r\nadvice, my fellow-countrymen, our Envoys should always be drunk. We go to\r\nSparta; we enter the city sober; why, we must be picking a quarrel\r\ndirectly. We don't understand what they say to us, we imagine a lot they\r\ndon't say at all, and we report home all wrong, all topsy-turvy. But,\r\nlook you, to-day it's quite different; we're enchanted whatever happens;\r\ninstead of Clitagoras, they might sing us Telamon,[466] and we should\r\nclap our hands just the same. A perjury or two into the bargain, la! what\r\ndoes that matter to merry companions in their cups?\r\n\r\nSLAVE. But here they are back again! Will you begone, you loafing\r\nscoundrels.\r\n\r\nMARKET-LOUNGER. Ah ha! here's the company coming out already.\r\n\r\nA LACONIAN. My dear, sweet friend, come, take your flute in hand; I would\r\nfain dance and sing my best in honour of the Athenians and our noble\r\nselves.\r\n\r\nAN ATHENIAN. Yes, take your flute, i' the gods' name. What a delight to\r\nsee him dance!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF LACONIANS. Oh Mnemosyné! inspire these men, inspire my muse who\r\nknows our exploits and those of the Athenians. With what a godlike ardour\r\ndid they swoop down at Artemisium[467] on the ships of the Medes! What a\r\nglorious victory was that! For the soldiers of Leonidas,[468] they were\r\nlike fierce wild-boars whetting their tushes. The sweat ran down their\r\nfaces, and drenched all their limbs, for verily the Persians were as many\r\nas the sands of the seashore. Oh! Artemis, huntress queen, whose arrows\r\npierce the denizens of the woods, virgin goddess, be thou favourable to\r\nthe Peace we here conclude; through thee may our hearts be long united!\r\nMay this treaty draw close for ever the bonds of a happy friendship! No\r\nmore wiles and stratagems! Aid us, oh! aid us, maiden huntress!\r\n\r\nLYSISTRATA. All is for the best; and now, Laconians, take your wives away\r\nhome with you, and you, Athenians, yours. May husband live happily with\r\nwife, and wife with husband. Dance, dance, to celebrate our bliss, and\r\nlet us be heedful to avoid like mistakes for the future.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF ATHENIANS Appear, appear, dancers, and the Graces with you! Let\r\nus invoke, one and all, Artemis, and her heavenly brother, gracious\r\nApollo, patron of the dance, and Dionysus, whose eye darts flame, as he\r\nsteps forward surrounded by the Maenad maids, and Zeus, who wields the\r\nflashing lightning, and his august, thrice-blessed spouse, the Queen of\r\nHeaven! These let us invoke, and all the other gods, calling all the\r\ninhabitants of the skies to witness the noble Peace now concluded under\r\nthe fond auspices of Aphrodité. Io Paean! Io Paean! dance, leap, as in\r\nhonour of a victory won. Evoé! Evoé! And you, our Laconian guests, sing\r\nus a new and inspiring strain!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF LACONIANS. Leave once more, oh! leave once more the noble\r\nheight of Taygetus, oh! Muse of Lacedaemon, and join us in singing the\r\npraises of Apollo of Amyclae, and Athena of the Brazen House, and the\r\ngallant twin sons of Tyndarus, who practise arms on the banks of Eurotas\r\nriver.[469] Haste, haste hither with nimble-footed pace, let us sing\r\nSparta, the city that delights in choruses divinely sweet and graceful\r\ndances, when our maidens bound lightly by the river side, like frolicsome\r\nfillies, beating the ground with rapid steps and shaking their long locks\r\nin the wind, as Bacchantes wave their wands in the wild revels of the\r\nWine-god. At their head, oh! chaste and beauteous goddess, daughter of\r\nLatona, Artemis, do thou lead the song and dance. A fillet binding thy\r\nwaving tresses, appear in thy loveliness; leap like a fawn; strike thy\r\ndivine hands together to animate the dance, and aid us to renown the\r\nvaliant goddess of battles, great Athené of the Brazen House!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFINIS OF \"LYSISTRATA\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[390] At Athens more than anywhere the festivals of Bacchus (Dionysus)\r\nwere celebrated with the utmost pomp--and also with the utmost licence,\r\nnot to say licentiousness.\r\n\r\nPan---the rustic god and king of the Satyrs; his feast was similarly an\r\noccasion of much coarse self-indulgence.\r\n\r\nAphrodité Colias--under this name the goddess was invoked by courtesans\r\nas patroness of sensual, physical love. She had a temple on the\r\npromontory of Colias, on the Attic coast--whence the surname.\r\n\r\nThe Genetyllides were minor deities, presiding over the act of\r\ngeneration, as the name indicates. Dogs were offered in sacrifice to\r\nthem--presumably because of the lubricity of that animal.\r\n\r\nAt the festivals of Dionysus, Pan and Aphrodité women used to perform\r\nlascivious dances to the accompaniment of the beating of tambourines.\r\nLysistrata implies that the women she had summoned to council cared\r\nreally for nothing but wanton pleasures.\r\n\r\n[391] An obscene _double entendre_; Calonicé understands, or pretends to\r\nunderstand, Lysistrata as meaning a long and thick \"membrum virile\"!\r\n\r\n[392] The eels from Lake Copaïs in Boeotia were esteemed highly by\r\nepicures.\r\n\r\n[393] This is the reproach Demosthenes constantly levelled against his\r\nAthenian fellow-countrymen--their failure to seize opportunity.\r\n\r\n[394] An island of the Saronic Gulf, lying between Magara and Attica. It\r\nwas separated by a narrow strait--scene of the naval battle of Salamis,\r\nin which the Athenians defeated Xerxes--only from the Attic coast, and\r\nwas subject to Athens.\r\n\r\n[395] A deme, or township, of Attica, lying five or six miles north of\r\nAthens. The Acharnians were throughout the most extreme partisans of the\r\nwarlike party during the Peloponnesian struggle. See 'The Acharnians.'\r\n\r\n[396] The precise reference is uncertain, and where the joke exactly\r\ncomes in. The Scholiast says Theagenes was a rich, miserly and\r\nsuperstitious citizen, who never undertook any enterprise without first\r\nconsulting an image of Hecaté, the distributor of honour and wealth\r\naccording to popular belief; and his wife would naturally follow her\r\nhusband's example.\r\n\r\n[397] A deme of Attica, a small and insignificant community--a 'Little\r\nPedlington' in fact.\r\n\r\n[398] In allusion to the gymnastic training which was _de rigueur_ at\r\nSparta for the women no less than the men, and in particular to the dance\r\nof the Lacedaemonian girls, in which the performer was expected to kick\r\nthe fundament with the heels--always a standing joke among the Athenians\r\nagainst their rivals and enemies the Spartans.\r\n\r\n[399] The allusion, of course, is to the 'garden of love,' the female\r\nparts, which it was the custom with the Greek women, as it is with the\r\nladies of the harem in Turkey to this day, to depilate scrupulously, with\r\nthe idea of making themselves more attractive to men.\r\n\r\n[400] Corinth was notorious in the Ancient world for its prostitutes and\r\ngeneral dissoluteness.\r\n\r\n[401] An Athenian general strongly suspected of treachery; Aristophanes\r\npretends his own soldiers have to see that he does not desert to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[402] A town and fortress on the west coast of Messenia, south-east part\r\nof Peloponnese, at the northern extremity of the bay of Sphacteria--the\r\nscene by the by of the modern naval battle of Navarino--in Lacedaemonian\r\nterritory; it had been seized by the Athenian fleet, and was still in\r\ntheir possession at the date, 412 B.C., of the representation of the\r\n'Lysistrata,' though two years later, in the twenty-second year of the\r\nWar, it was recovered by Sparta.\r\n\r\n[403] The Athenian women, rightly or wrongly, had the reputation of being\r\nover fond of wine. Aristophanes, here and elsewhere, makes many jests on\r\nthis weakness of theirs.\r\n\r\n[404] The lofty range of hills overlooking Sparta from the west.\r\n\r\n[405] In the original \"we are nothing but Poseidon and a boat\"; the\r\nallusion is to a play of Sophocles, now lost, but familiar to\r\nAristophanes' audience, entitled 'Tyro,' in which the heroine, Tyro,\r\nappears with Poseidon, the sea-god, at the beginning of the tragedy, and\r\nat the close with the two boys she had had by him, whom she exposes in an\r\nopen boat.\r\n\r\n[406] \"By the two goddesses,\"--a woman's oath, which recurs constantly in\r\nthis play; the two goddesses are always Demeter and Proserpine.\r\n\r\n[407] One of the Cyclades, between Naxos and Cos, celebrated, like the\r\nlatter, for its manufacture of fine, almost transparent silks, worn in\r\nGreece, and later at Rome, by women of loose character.\r\n\r\n[408] The proverb, quoted by Pherecrates, is properly spoken of those who\r\ngo out of their way to do a thing already done--\"to kill a dead horse,\"\r\nbut here apparently is twisted by Aristophanes into an allusion to the\r\nleathern 'godemiche' mentioned a little above; if the worst comes to the\r\nworst, we must use artificial means. Pherecrates was a comic playwright,\r\na contemporary of Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n[409] Literally \"our Scythian woman.\" At Athens, policemen and ushers in\r\nthe courts were generally Scythians; so the revolting women must have\r\n_their_ Scythian \"Usheress\" too.\r\n\r\n[410] In allusion to the oath which the seven allied champions before\r\nThebes take upon a buckler, in Aeschylus' tragedy of 'The Seven against\r\nThebes,' v. 42.\r\n\r\n[411] A volcanic island in the northern part of the Aegaean, celebrated\r\nfor its vineyards.\r\n\r\n[412] The old men are carrying faggots and fire to burn down the gates of\r\nthe Acropolis, and supply comic material by their panting and wheezing as\r\nthey climb the steep approaches to the fortress and puff and blow at\r\ntheir fires. Aristophanes gives them names, purely fancy ones--Draces,\r\nStrymodorus, Philurgus, Laches.\r\n\r\n[413] Cleomenes, King of Sparta, had in the preceding century commanded a\r\nLacedaemonian expedition against Athens. At the invitation of the\r\nAlcmaeonidae, enemies of the sons of Peisistratus, he seized the\r\nAcropolis, but after an obstinately contested siege was forced to\r\ncapitulate and retire.\r\n\r\n[414] Lemnos was proverbial with the Greeks for chronic misfortune and a\r\nsuccession of horrors and disasters. Can any good thing come out of\r\n_Lemnos_?\r\n\r\n[415] That is, a friend of the Athenian people; Samos had just before the\r\ndate of the play re-established the democracy and renewed the old\r\nalliance with Athens.\r\n\r\n[416] A second Chorus enters--of women who are hurrying up with water to\r\nextinguish the fire just started by the Chorus of old men. Nicodicé,\r\nCalycé, Crityllé, Rhodippé, are fancy names the poet gives to different\r\nmembers of the band. Another, Stratyllis, has been stopped by the old men\r\non her way to rejoin her companions.\r\n\r\n[417] Bupalus was a celebrated contemporary sculptor, a native of\r\nClazomenae. The satiric poet Hipponax, who was extremely ugly, having\r\nbeen portrayed by Bupalus as even more unsightly-looking than the\r\nreality, composed against the artist so scurrilous an invective that the\r\nlatter hung himself in despair. Apparently Aristophanes alludes here to a\r\nverse in which Hipponax threatened to beat Bupalus.\r\n\r\n[418] The Heliasts at Athens were the body of citizens chosen by lot to\r\nact as jurymen (or, more strictly speaking, as judges and jurymen, the\r\nDicast, or so-called Judge, being merely President of the Court, the\r\nmajority of the Heliasts pronouncing sentence) in the Heliaia, or High\r\nCourt, where all offences liable to public prosecution were tried. They\r\nwere 6000 in number, divided into ten panels of 500 each, a thousand\r\nbeing held in reserve to supply occasional vacancies. Each Heliast was\r\npaid three obols for each day's attendance in court.\r\n\r\n[419] Women only celebrated the festivals of Adonis. These rites were not\r\nperformed in public, but on the terraces and flat roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\n[420] The Assembly, or Ecclesia, was the General Parliament of the\r\nAthenian people, in which every adult citizen had a vote. It met on the\r\nPnyx hill, where the assembled Ecclesiasts were addressed from the Bema,\r\nor speaking-block.\r\n\r\n[421] An orator and statesman who had first proposed the disastrous\r\nSicilian Expedition, of 415-413 B.C. This was on the first day of the\r\nfestival of Adonis--ever afterwards regarded by the Athenians as a day of\r\nill omen.\r\n\r\n[422] An island in the Ionian Sea, on the west of Greece, near\r\nCephalenia, and an ally of Athens during the Peloponnesian War.\r\n\r\n[423] Cholozyges, a nickname for Demostratus.\r\n\r\n[424] The State treasure was kept in the Acropolis, which the women had\r\nseized.\r\n\r\n[425] The second (mythical) king of Athens, successor of Cecrops.\r\n\r\n[426] The leader of the Revolution which resulted in the temporary\r\noverthrow of the Democracy at Athens (413, 412 B.C.), and the\r\nestablishment of the Oligarchy of the Four Hundred.\r\n\r\n[427] Priests of Cybelé, who indulged in wild, frenzied dances, to the\r\naccompaniment of the clashing of cymbals, in their celebrations in honour\r\nof the goddess.\r\n\r\n[428] Captain of a cavalry division; they were chosen from amongst the\r\n_Hippeis_, or 'Knights' at Athens.\r\n\r\n[429] In allusion to a play of Euripides, now lost, with this title.\r\nTereus was son of Ares and king of the Thracians in Daulis.\r\n\r\n[430] An allusion to the disastrous Sicilian Expedition (415-413 B.C.),\r\nin which many thousands of Athenian citizens perished.\r\n\r\n[431] The dead were laid out at Athens before the house door.\r\n\r\n[432] An offering made to the Manes of the deceased on the third day\r\nafter the funeral.\r\n\r\n[433] Hippias and Hipparchus, the two sons of Pisistratus, known as the\r\nPisistratidae, became Tyrants of Athens upon their father's death in 527\r\nB.C. In 514 the latter was assassinated by the conspirators, Harmodius\r\nand Aristogiton, who took the opportunity of the Panathenaic festival and\r\nconcealed their daggers in myrtle wreaths. They were put to death, but\r\nfour years later the surviving Tyrant Hippias was expelled, and the young\r\nand noble martyrs to liberty were ever after held in the highest honour\r\nby their fellow-citizens. Their statues stood in the Agora or Public\r\nMarket-Square.\r\n\r\n[434] That is, the three obols paid for attendance as a Heliast at the\r\nHigh Court.\r\n\r\n[435] See above, under note 3 [433. Transcriber.].\r\n\r\n[436] The origin of the name was this: in ancient days a tame bear\r\nconsecrated to Artemis, the huntress goddess, it seems, devoured a young\r\ngirl, whose brothers killed the offender. Artemis was angered and sent a\r\nterrible pestilence upon the city, which only ceased when, by direction\r\nof the oracle, a company of maidens was dedicated to the deity, to act\r\nthe part of she-bears in the festivities held annually in her honour at\r\nthe _Brauronia_, her festival so named from the deme of Brauron in\r\nAttica.\r\n\r\n[437] The Basket-Bearers, Canephoroi, at Athens were the maidens who,\r\nclad in flowing robes, carried in baskets on their heads the sacred\r\nimplements and paraphernalia in procession at the celebrations in honour\r\nof Demeter, Dionysus and Athené.\r\n\r\n[438] A treasure formed by voluntary contributions at the time of the\r\nPersian Wars; by Aristophanes' day it had all been dissipated, through\r\nthe influence of successive demagogues, in distributions and gifts to the\r\npublic under various pretexts.\r\n\r\n[439] A town and fortress of Southern Attica, in the neighbourhood of\r\nMarathon, occupied by the Alcmaeonidae--the noble family or clan at\r\nAthens banished from the city in 595 B.C., restored 560, but again\r\nexpelled by Pisistratus--in the course of their contest with that Tyrant.\r\nReturning to Athens on the death of Hippias (510 B.C.), they united with\r\nthe democracy, and the then head of the family, Cleisthenes, gave a new\r\nconstitution to the city.\r\n\r\n[440] Queen of Halicarnassus, in Caria; an ally of the Persian King\r\nXerxes in his invasion of Greece; she fought gallantly at the battle of\r\nSalamis.\r\n\r\n[441] A _double entendre_--with allusion to the posture in sexual\r\nintercourse known among the Greeks as [Greek: hippos], in Latin 'equus,'\r\nthe horse, where the woman mounts the man in reversal of the ordinary\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[442] Micon, a famous Athenian painter, decorated the walls of the\r\nPoecilé Stoa, or Painted Porch, at Athens with a series of frescoes\r\nrepresenting the battles of the Amazons with Theseus and the Athenians.\r\n\r\n[443] To avenge itself on the eagle, the beetle threw the former's eggs\r\nout of the nest and broke them. See the Fables of Aesop.\r\n\r\n[444] Keeper of a house of ill fame apparently.\r\n\r\n[445] \"As chaste as Melanion\" was a Greek proverb. Who Melanion was is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[446] Myronides and Phormio were famous Athenian generals. The former was\r\ncelebrated for his conquest of all Boeotia, except Thebes, in 458 B.C.;\r\nthe latter, with a fleet of twenty triremes, equipped at his own cost,\r\ndefeated a Lacedaemonian fleet of forty-seven sail, in 429.\r\n\r\n[447] Timon, the misanthrope; he was an Athenian and a contemporary of\r\nAristophanes. Disgusted by the ingratitude of his fellow-citizens and\r\nsickened with repeated disappointments, he retired altogether from\r\nsociety, admitting no one, it is said, to his intimacy except the\r\nbrilliant young statesman Alcibiades.\r\n\r\n[448] A spring so named within the precincts of the Acropolis.\r\n\r\n[449] The comic poets delighted in introducing Heracles (Hercules) on the\r\nstage as an insatiable glutton, whom the other characters were for ever\r\ntantalizing by promising toothsome dishes and then making him wait\r\nindefinitely for their arrival.\r\n\r\n[450] The Rhodian perfumes and unguents were less esteemed than the\r\nSyrian.\r\n\r\n[451] 'Dog-fox,' nickname of a certain notorious Philostratus, keeper of\r\nan Athenian brothel of note in Aristophanes' day.\r\n\r\n[452] The god of gardens--and of lubricity; represented by a grotesque\r\nfigure with an enormous penis.\r\n\r\n[453] A staff in use among the Lacedaemonians for writing cipher\r\ndespatches. A strip of leather or paper was wound round the 'skytalé,' on\r\nwhich the required message was written lengthwise, so that when unrolled\r\nit became unintelligible; the recipient abroad had a staff of the same\r\nthickness and pattern, and so was enabled by rewinding the document to\r\ndecipher the words.\r\n\r\n[454] A city of Achaia, the acquisition of which had long been an object\r\nof Lacedaemonian ambition. To make the joke intelligible here, we must\r\nsuppose Pellené was also the name of some notorious courtesan of the day.\r\n\r\n[455] A deme of Attica, abounding in woods and marshes, where the gnats\r\nwere particularly troublesome. There is very likely also an allusion to\r\nthe spiteful, teasing character of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[456] A mina was a little over £4; 60 minas made a talent.\r\n\r\n[457] Carystus was a city of Euboea notorious for the dissoluteness of\r\nits inhabitants; hence the inclusion of these Carystian youths in the\r\nwomen's invitation.\r\n\r\n[458] A [Greek: para prosdokian]; i.e. exactly the opposite of the word\r\nexpected is used to conclude the sentence--to move the sudden hilarity of\r\nthe audience as a finale to the scene.\r\n\r\n[459] A wattled cage or pen for pigs.\r\n\r\n[460] An effeminate, a pathic; failing women, they will have to resort to\r\npederasty.\r\n\r\n[461] These _Hermae_ were half-length figures of the god Hermes, which\r\nstood at the corners of streets and in public places at Athens. One\r\nnight, just before the sailing of the Sicilian Expedition, they were all\r\nmutilated--to the consternation of the inhabitants. Alcibiades and his\r\nwild companions were suspected of the outrage.\r\n\r\n[462] They had repeatedly dismissed with scant courtesy successive\r\nLacedaemonian embassies coming to propose terms of peace after the\r\nnotable Athenian successes at Pylos, when the Island of Sphacteria was\r\ncaptured and 600 Spartan citizens brought prisoners to Athens. This was\r\nin 425 B.C., the seventh year of the War.\r\n\r\n[463] Chief of the Lacedaemonian embassy which came to Athens, after the\r\nearthquake of 464 B.C., which almost annihilated the town of Sparta, to\r\ninvoke the help of the Athenians against the revolted Messenians and\r\nhelots.\r\n\r\n[464] Echinus was a town on the Thessalian coast, at the entrance to the\r\nMaliac Gulf, near Thermopylae and opposite the northern end of the\r\nAthenian island of Euboea. By the \"legs of Megara\" are meant the two\r\n\"long walls\" or lines of fortification connecting the city of Megara with\r\nits seaport Nisaea--in the same way as Piraeus was joined to Athens.\r\n\r\n[465] Examples of [Greek: para prosdokian] again; see above.\r\n\r\n[466] Clitagoras was a composer of drinking songs, Telamon of war songs.\r\n\r\n[467] Here, off the north coast of Euboea, the Greeks defeated the\r\nPersians in a naval battle, 480 B.C.\r\n\r\n[468] The hero of Thermopylae, where the 300 Athenians arrested the\r\nadvance of the invading hosts of Xerxes in the same year.\r\n\r\n[469] Amyclae, an ancient town on the Eurotas within two or three miles\r\nof Sparta, the traditional birthplace of Castor and Pollux; here stood a\r\nfamous and magnificent Temple of Apollo.\r\n\r\n\"Of the Brazen House,\" a surname of Athené, from the Temple dedicated to\r\nher worship at Chalcis in Euboea, the walls of which were covered with\r\nplates of brass.\r\n\r\nSons of Tyndarus, that is, Castor and Pollux, \"the great twin brethren,\"\r\nheld in peculiar reverence at Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe satire in this, one of the best known of all Aristophanes' comedies,\r\nis directed against the new schools of philosophy, or perhaps we should\r\nrather say dialectic, which had lately been introduced, mostly from\r\nabroad, at Athens. The doctrines held up to ridicule are those of the\r\n'Sophists'--such men as Thrasymachus from Chalcedon in Bithynia, Gorgias\r\nfrom Leontini in Sicily, Protagoras from Abdera in Thrace, and other\r\nforeign scholars and rhetoricians who had flocked to Athens as the\r\nintellectual centre of the Hellenic world. Strange to say, Socrates of\r\nall people, the avowed enemy and merciless critic of these men and their\r\nmethods, is taken as their representative, and personally attacked with\r\npitiless raillery. Presumably this was merely because he was the most\r\nprominent and noteworthy teacher and thinker of the day, while his\r\ngrotesque personal appearance and startling eccentricities of behaviour\r\ngave a ready handle to caricature. Neither the author nor his audience\r\ntook the trouble, or were likely to take the trouble, to discriminate\r\nnicely; there was, of course, a general resemblance between the Socratic\r\n'elenchos' and the methods of the new practitioners of dialectic; and\r\nthis was enough for stage purposes. However unjustly, Socrates is taken\r\nas typical of the newfangled sophistical teachers, just as in 'The\r\nAcharnians' Lamachus, with his Gorgon shield, is introduced as\r\nrepresentative of the War party, though that general was not specially\r\nresponsible for the continuance of hostilities more than anybody else.\r\n\r\nAristophanes' point of view, as a member of the aristocratical party and\r\na fine old Conservative, is that these Sophists, as the professors of the\r\nnew education had come to be called, and Socrates as their protagonist,\r\nwere insincere and dangerous innovators, corrupting morals, persuading\r\nyoung men to despise the old-fashioned, home-grown virtues of the State\r\nand teaching a system of false and pernicious tricks of verbal fence\r\nwhereby anything whatever could be proved, and the worse be made to seem\r\nthe better--provided always sufficient payment were forthcoming. True,\r\nSocrates refused to take money from his pupils, and made it his chief\r\nreproach against the lecturing Sophists that they received fees; but what\r\nof that? The Comedian cannot pay heed to such fine distinctions, but\r\nbelabours the whole tribe with indiscriminate raillery and scurrility.\r\n\r\nThe play was produced at the Great Dionysia in 423 B.C., but proved\r\nunsuccessful, Cratinus and Amipsias being awarded first and second prize.\r\nThis is said to have been due to the intrigues and influence of\r\nAlcibiades, who resented the caricature of himself presented in the\r\nsporting Phidippides. A second edition of the drama was apparently\r\nproduced some years later, to which the 'Parabasis' of the play as we\r\npossess it must belong, as it refers to events subsequent to the date\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe plot is briefly as follows: Strepsiades, a wealthy country gentleman,\r\nhas been brought to penury and deeply involved in debt by the\r\nextravagance and horsy tastes of his son Phidippides. Having heard of the\r\nwonderful new art of argument, the royal road to success in litigation,\r\ndiscovered by the Sophists, he hopes that, if only he can enter the\r\n'Phrontisterion,' or Thinking-Shop, of Socrates, he will learn how to\r\nturn the tables on his creditors and avoid paying the debts which are\r\ndragging him down. He joins the school accordingly, but is found too old\r\nand stupid to profit by the lessons. So his son Phidippides is\r\nsubstituted as a more promising pupil. The latter takes to the new\r\nlearning like a duck to water, and soon shows what progress he has made\r\nby beating his father and demonstrating that he is justified by all laws,\r\ndivine and human, in what he is doing. This opens the old man's eyes, who\r\nsets fire to the 'Phrontisterion,' and the play ends in a great\r\nconflagration of this home of humbug.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES.\r\nPHIDIPPIDES.\r\nSERVANT OF STREPSIADES.\r\nSOCRATES.\r\nDISCIPLES OF SOCRATES.\r\nJUST DISCOURSE.\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE.\r\nPASIAS, a Money-lender.\r\nPASIAS' WITNESS.\r\nAMYNIAS, another Money-lender.\r\nCHAEREPHON.\r\nCHORUS OF CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nSCENE: A sleeping-room in Strepsiades' house; then in front of Socrates'\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES.[470] Great gods! will these nights never end? will daylight\r\nnever come? I heard the cock crow long ago and my slaves are snoring\r\nstill! Ah! 'twas not so formerly. Curses on the War! has it not done me\r\nills enough? Now I may not even chastise my own slaves.[471] Again\r\nthere's this brave lad, who never wakes the whole long night, but,\r\nwrapped in his five coverlets, farts away to his heart's content. Come!\r\nlet me nestle in well and snore too, if it be possible ... oh! misery,\r\n'tis vain to think of sleep with all these expenses, this stable, these\r\ndebts, which are devouring me, thanks to this fine cavalier, who only\r\nknows how to look after his long locks, to show himself off in his\r\nchariot and to dream of horses! And I, I am nearly dead, when I see the\r\nmoon bringing the third decade in her train[472] and my liability falling\r\ndue.... Slave! light the lamp and bring me my tablets. Who are all my\r\ncreditors? Let me see and reckon up the interest. What is it I owe? ...\r\nTwelve minae to Pasias.... What! twelve minae to Pasias? ... Why did I\r\nborrow these? Ah! I know! 'Twas to buy that thoroughbred, which cost me\r\nso dear.[473] How I should have prized the stone that had blinded him!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES (_in his sleep_). That's not fair, Philo! Drive your chariot\r\nstraight,[474] I say.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis this that is destroying me. He raves about horses, even\r\nin his sleep.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES (_still sleeping_). How many times round the track is the\r\nrace for the chariots of war?[475]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis your own father you are driving to death ... to ruin.\r\nCome! what debt comes next, after that of Pasias? ... Three minae to\r\nAmynias for a chariot and its two wheels.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES (_still asleep_). Give the horse a good roll in the dust and\r\nlead him home.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! wretched boy! 'tis my money that you are making roll. My\r\ncreditors have distrained on my goods, and here are others again, who\r\ndemand security for their interest.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES (_awaking_). What is the matter with you, father, that you\r\ngroan and turn about the whole night through?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I have a bum-bailiff in the bedclothes biting me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. For pity's sake, let me have a little sleep.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Very well, sleep on! but remember that all these debts will\r\nfall back on your shoulders. Oh! curses on the go-between who made me\r\nmarry your mother! I lived so happily in the country, a commonplace,\r\neveryday life, but a good and easy one--had not a trouble, not a care,\r\nwas rich in bees, in sheep and in olives. Then forsooth I must marry the\r\nniece of Megacles, the son of Megacles; I belonged to the country, she\r\nwas from the town; she was a haughty, extravagant woman, a true\r\nCoesyra.[476] On the nuptial day, when I lay beside her, I was reeking of\r\nthe dregs of the wine-cup, of cheese and of wool; she was redolent with\r\nessences, saffron, tender kisses, the love of spending, of good cheer and\r\nof wanton delights. I will not say she did nothing; no, she worked hard\r\n... to ruin me, and pretending all the while merely to be showing her the\r\ncloak she had woven for me, I said, \"Wife, you go too fast about your\r\nwork, your threads are too closely woven and you use far too much wool.\"\r\n\r\nA SLAVE. There is no more oil in the lamp.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why then did you light such a guzzling lamp? Come here, I am\r\ngoing to beat you!\r\n\r\nSLAVE. What for?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Because you have put in too thick a wick.... Later, when we\r\nhad this boy, what was to be his name? 'Twas the cause of much\r\nquarrelling with my loving wife. She insisted on having some reference to\r\na horse in his name, that he should be called Xanthippus, Charippus or\r\nCallippides.[477] I wanted to name him Phidonides after his\r\ngrandfather.[478] We disputed long, and finally agreed to style him\r\nPhidippides....[479] She used to fondle and coax him, saying, \"Oh! what a\r\njoy it will be to me when you have grown up, to see you, like my father,\r\nMegacles,[480] clothed in purple and standing up straight in your chariot\r\ndriving your steeds toward the town.\" And I would say to him, \"When, like\r\nyour father, you will go, dressed in a skin, to fetch back your goats\r\nfrom Phelleus.\"[481] Alas! he never listened to me and his madness for\r\nhorses has shattered my fortune. But by dint of thinking the livelong\r\nnight, I have discovered a road to salvation, both miraculous and divine.\r\nIf he will but follow it, I shall be out of my trouble! First, however,\r\nhe must be awakened, but let it be done as gently as possible. How shall\r\nI manage it? Phidippides! my little Phidippides!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is it, father!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Kiss me and give me your hand.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. There! What's it all about?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me! do you love me?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. By Posidon, the equestrian Posidon! yes, I swear I do.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, do not, I pray you, invoke this god of horses; 'tis he\r\nwho is the cause of all my cares. But if you really love me, and with\r\nyour whole heart, my boy, believe me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Believe you? about what?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Alter your habits forthwith and go and learn what I tell\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Say on, what are your orders?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Will you obey me ever so little?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. By Bacchus, I will obey you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Very well then! Look this way. Do you see that little door\r\nand that little house?[482]\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Yes, father. But what are you driving at?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. That is the school of wisdom. There, they prove that we are\r\ncoals enclosed on all sides under a vast extinguisher, which is the\r\nsky.[483] If well paid,[484] these men also teach one how to gain\r\nlaw-suits, whether they be just or not.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What do they call themselves?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I do not know exactly, but they are deep thinkers and most\r\nadmirable people.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Bah! the wretches! I know them; you mean those quacks with\r\nlivid faces,[485] those barefoot fellows, such as that miserable Socrates\r\nand Chaerephon.[486]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Silence! say nothing foolish! If you desire your father not\r\nto die of hunger, join their company and let your horses go.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, by Bacchus! even though you gave me the pheasants that\r\nLeogoras rears.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! my beloved son, I beseech you, go and follow their\r\nteachings.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what is it I should learn?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Twould seem they have two courses of reasoning, the true\r\nand the false, and that, thanks to the false, the worst law-suits can be\r\ngained. If then you learn this science, which is false, I shall not pay\r\nan obolus of all the debts I have contracted on your account.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, I will not do it. I should no longer dare to look at our\r\ngallant horsemen, when I had so tarnished my fair hue of honour.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well then, by Demeter! I will no longer support you, neither\r\nyou, nor your team, nor your saddle-horse. Go and hang yourself, I turn\r\nyou out of house and home.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. My uncle Megacles will not leave me without horses; I shall\r\ngo to him and laugh at your anger.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. One rebuff shall not dishearten me. With the help of the\r\ngods I will enter this school and learn myself. But at my age, memory has\r\ngone and the mind is slow to grasp things. How can all these fine\r\ndistinctions, these subtleties be learned? Bah! why should I dally thus\r\ninstead of rapping at the door? Slave, slave! (_He knocks and calls._)\r\n\r\nA DISCIPLE. A plague on you! Who are you?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Strepsiades, the son of Phido, of the deme of Cicynna.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. 'Tis for sure only an ignorant and illiterate fellow who lets\r\ndrive at the door with such kicks. You have brought on a miscarriage--of\r\nan idea!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Pardon me, pray; for I live far away from here in the\r\ncountry. But tell me, what was the idea that miscarried?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. I may not tell it to any but a disciple.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Then tell me without fear, for I have come to study among\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Very well then, but reflect, that these are mysteries. Lately,\r\na flea bit Chaerephon on the brow and then from there sprang on to the\r\nhead of Socrates. Socrates asked Chaerephon, \"How many times the length\r\nof its legs does a flea jump?\"\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And how ever did he set about measuring it?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Oh! 'twas most ingenious! He melted some wax, seized the flea\r\nand dipped its two feet in the wax, which, when cooled, left them shod\r\nwith true Persian buskins.[487] These he slipped off and with them\r\nmeasured the distance.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! great Zeus! what a brain! what subtlety!\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. I wonder what then would you say, if you knew another of\r\nSocrates' contrivances?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What is it? Pray tell me.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Chaerephon of the deme of Sphettia asked him whether he thought\r\na gnat buzzed through its proboscis or through its rear.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And what did he say about the gnat?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. He said that the gut of the gnat was narrow, and that, in\r\npassing through this tiny passage, the air is driven with force towards\r\nthe breech; then after this slender channel, it encountered the rump,\r\nwhich was distended like a trumpet, and there it resounded sonorously.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. So the rear of a gnat is a trumpet. Oh! what a splendid\r\ndiscovery! Thrice happy Socrates! 'Twould not be difficult to succeed in\r\na law-suit, knowing so much about the gut of a gnat!\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Not long ago a lizard caused him the loss of a sublime thought.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. In what way, an it please you?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. One night, when he was studying the course of the moon and its\r\nrevolutions and was gazing open-mouthed at the heavens, a lizard shitted\r\nupon him from the top of the roof.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. This lizard, that relieved itself over Socrates, tickles me.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Yesternight we had nothing to eat.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well! What did he contrive, to secure you some supper?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. He spread over the table a light layer of cinders, bending an\r\niron rod the while; then he took up a pair of compasses and at the same\r\nmoment unhooked a piece of the victim which was hanging in the\r\npalaestra.[488]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And we still dare to admire Thales![489] Open, open this\r\nhome of knowledge to me quickly! Haste, haste to show me Socrates; I long\r\nto become his disciple. But do, do open the door. (_The disciple admits\r\nStrepsiades._) Ah! by Heracles! what country are those animals from?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Why, what are you astonished at? What do you think they\r\nresemble?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The captives of Pylos.[490] But why do they look so fixedly\r\non the ground?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. They are seeking for what is below the ground.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! 'tis onions they are seeking. Do not give yourselves so\r\nmuch trouble; I know where there are some, fine and large ones. But what\r\nare those fellows doing, who are bent all double?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. They are sounding the abysses of Tartarus.[491]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And what is their rump looking at in the heavens?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. It is studying astronomy on its own account. But come in; so\r\nthat the master may not find us here.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Not yet, not yet; let them not change their position. I want\r\nto tell them my own little matter.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. But they may not stay too long in the open air and away from\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. In the name of all the gods, what is that? Tell me.\r\n(_Pointing to a celestial globe._)\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. That is astronomy.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And that? (_Pointing to a map._)\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Geometry.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What is that used for?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. To measure the land.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But that is apportioned by lot.[492]\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. No, no, I mean the entire earth.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! what a funny thing! How generally useful indeed is this\r\ninvention!\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. There is the whole surface of the earth. Look! Here is Athens.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Athens! you are mistaken; I see no courts sitting.[493]\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Nevertheless it is really and truly the Attic territory.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And where are my neighbours of Cicynna?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. They live here. This is Euboea; you see this island, that is so\r\nlong and narrow.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I know. 'Tis we and Pericles, who have stretched it by dint\r\nof squeezing it.[494] And where is Lacedaemon?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Lacedaemon? Why, here it is, look.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How near it is to us! Think it well over, it must be removed\r\nto a greater distance.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. But, by Zeus, that is not possible.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Then, woe to you! And who is this man suspended up in a\r\nbasket?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. 'Tis _he himself_.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Who himself?\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Socrates.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Socrates! Oh! I pray you, call him right loudly for me.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. Call him yourself; I have no time to waste.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Socrates! my little Socrates!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Mortal, what do you want with me?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. First, what are you doing up there? Tell me, I beseech you.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. I traverse the air and contemplate the sun.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Thus 'tis not on the solid ground, but from the height of\r\nthis basket, that you slight the gods, if indeed....[495]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. I have to suspend my brain and mingle the subtle essence of my\r\nmind with this air, which is of the like nature, in order to clearly\r\npenetrate the things of heaven.[496] I should have discovered nothing,\r\nhad I remained on the ground to consider from below the things that are\r\nabove; for the earth by its force attracts the sap of the mind to itself.\r\n'Tis just the same with the water-cress.[497]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What? Does the mind attract the sap of the water-cress? Ah!\r\nmy dear little Socrates, come down to me! I have come to ask you for\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. And for what lessons?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I want to learn how to speak. I have borrowed money, and my\r\nmerciless creditors do not leave me a moment's peace; all my goods are at\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. And how was it you did not see that you were getting so much\r\ninto debt?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. My ruin has been the madness for horses, a most rapacious\r\nevil; but teach me one of your two methods of reasoning, the one whose\r\nobject is not to repay anything, and, may the gods bear witness, that I\r\nam ready to pay any fee you may name.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. By which gods will you swear? To begin with, the gods are not a\r\ncoin current with us.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But what do you swear by then? By the iron money of\r\nByzantium?[498]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Do you really wish to know the truth of celestial matters?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, truly, if 'tis possible.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. ... and to converse with the clouds, who are our genii?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Without a doubt.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Then be seated on this sacred couch.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I am seated.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Now take this chaplet.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why a chaplet? Alas! Socrates, would you sacrifice me, like\r\nAthamas?[499]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. No, these are the rites of initiation.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And what is it I am to gain?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You will become a thorough rattle-pate, a hardened old stager,\r\nthe fine flour of the talkers.... But come, keep quiet.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. By Zeus! You lie not! Soon I shall be nothing but\r\nwheat-flour, if you powder me in this fashion.[500]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Silence, old man, give heed to the prayers.... Oh! most mighty\r\nking, the boundless air, that keepest the earth suspended in space, thou\r\nbright Aether and ye venerable goddesses, the Clouds, who carry in your\r\nloins the thunder and the lightning, arise, ye sovereign powers and\r\nmanifest yourselves in the celestial spheres to the eyes of the sage.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Not yet! Wait a bit, till I fold my mantle double, so as not\r\nto get wet. And to think that I did not even bring my travelling cap!\r\nWhat a misfortune!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, oh! Clouds, whom I adore, come and show yourselves to\r\nthis man, whether you be resting on the sacred summits of Olympus,\r\ncrowned with hoar-frost, or tarrying in the gardens of Ocean, your\r\nfather, forming sacred choruses with the Nymphs; whether you be gathering\r\nthe waves of the Nile in golden vases or dwelling in the Maeotic marsh or\r\non the snowy rocks of Mimas, hearken to my prayer and accept my offering.\r\nMay these sacrifices be pleasing to you.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Eternal Clouds, let us appear, let us arise from the roaring\r\ndepths of Ocean, our father; let us fly towards the lofty mountains,\r\nspread our damp wings over their forest-laden summits, whence we will\r\ndominate the distant valleys, the harvest fed by the sacred earth, the\r\nmurmur of the divine streams and the resounding waves of the sea, which\r\nthe unwearying orb lights up with its glittering beams. But let us shake\r\noff the rainy fogs, which hide our immortal beauty and sweep the earth\r\nfrom afar with our gaze.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Oh, venerated goddesses, yes, you are answering my call! (_To\r\nStrepsiades._) Did you hear their voices mingling with the awful growling\r\nof the thunder?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! adorable Clouds, I revere you and I too am going to let\r\noff _my_ thunder, so greatly has your own affrighted me. Faith! whether\r\npermitted or not, I must, I must shit!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. No scoffing; do not copy those accursed comic poets. Come,\r\nsilence! a numerous host of goddesses approaches with songs.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Virgins, who pour forth the rains, let us move toward Attica, the\r\nrich country of Pallas, the home of the brave; let us visit the dear land\r\nof Cecrops, where the secret rites[501] are celebrated, where the\r\nmysterious sanctuary flies open to the initiate.... What victims are\r\noffered there to the deities of heaven! What glorious temples! What\r\nstatues! What holy prayers to the rulers of Olympus! At every season\r\nnothing but sacred festivals, garlanded victims, are to be seen. Then\r\nSpring brings round again the joyous feasts of Dionysus, the harmonious\r\ncontests of the choruses and the serious melodies of the flute.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. By Zeus! Tell me, Socrates, I pray you, who are these women,\r\nwhose language is so solemn; can they be demigoddesses?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Not at all. They are the Clouds of heaven, great goddesses for\r\nthe lazy; to them we owe all, thoughts, speeches, trickery, roguery,\r\nboasting, lies, sagacity.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! that was why, as I listened to them, my mind spread out\r\nits wings; it burns to babble about trifles, to maintain worthless\r\narguments, to voice its petty reasons, to contradict, to tease some\r\nopponent. But are they not going to show themselves? I should like to see\r\nthem, were it possible.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well, look this way in the direction of Parnes;[502] I already\r\nsee those who are slowly descending.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But where, where? Show them to me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. They are advancing in a throng, following an oblique path\r\nacross the dales and thickets.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis strange! I can see nothing.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. There, close to the entrance.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Hardly, if at all, can I distinguish them.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You _must_ see them clearly now, unless your eyes are filled\r\nwith gum as thick as pumpkins.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Aye, undoubtedly! Oh! the venerable goddesses! Why, they\r\nfill up the entire stage.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. And you did not know, you never suspected, that they were\r\ngoddesses?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, indeed; methought the Clouds were only fog, dew and\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. But what you certainly do not know is that they are the support\r\nof a crowd of quacks, both the diviners, who were sent to Thurium,[503]\r\nthe notorious physicians, the well-combed fops, who load their fingers\r\nwith rings down to the nails, and the baggarts, who write dithyrambic\r\nverses, all these are idlers whom the Clouds provide a living for,\r\nbecause they sing them in their verses.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis then for this that they praise \"the rapid flight of the\r\nmoist clouds, which veil the brightness of day\" and \"the waving locks of\r\nthe hundred-headed Typho\" and \"the impetuous tempests, which float\r\nthrough the heavens, like birds of prey with aerial wings, loaded with\r\nmists\" and \"the rains, the dew, which the clouds outpour.\"[504] As a\r\nreward for these fine phrases they bolt well-grown, tasty mullet and\r\ndelicate thrushes.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Yes, thanks to these. And is it not right and meet?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me then why, if these really are the Clouds, they so\r\nvery much resemble mortals. This is not their usual form.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What are they like then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I don't know exactly; well, they are like great packs of\r\nwool, but not like women--no, not in the least.... And these have noses.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Answer my questions.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Willingly! Go on, I am listening.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Have you not sometimes seen clouds in the sky like a centaur, a\r\nleopard, a wolf or a bull?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, certainly I have, but what then?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. They take what metamorphosis they like. If they see a debauchee\r\nwith long flowing locks and hairy as a beast, like the son of\r\nXenophantes,[505] they take the form of a Centaur[506] in derision of his\r\nshameful passion.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And when they see Simon, that thiever of public money, what\r\ndo they do then?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. To picture him to the life, they turn at once into wolves.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. So that was why yesterday, when they saw Cleonymus,[507] who\r\ncast away his buckler because he is the veriest poltroon amongst men,\r\nthey changed into deer.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. And to-day they have seen Clisthenes;[508] you see ... they are\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Hail, sovereign goddesses, and if ever you have let your\r\ncelestial voice be heard by mortal ears, speak to me, oh! speak to me, ye\r\nall-powerful queens.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Hail! veteran of the ancient times, you who burn to instruct\r\nyourself in fine language. And you, great high-priest of subtle nonsense,\r\ntell us your desire. To you and Prodicus[509] alone of all the hollow\r\norationers of to-day have we lent an ear--to Prodicus, because of his\r\nknowledge and his great wisdom, and to you, because you walk with head\r\nerect, a confident look, barefooted, resigned to everything and proud of\r\nour protection.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! Earth! What august utterances! how sacred! how wondrous!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. That is because these are the only goddesses; all the rest are\r\npure myth.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But by the Earth! is our Father, Zeus, the Olympian, not a\r\ngod?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Zeus! what Zeus? Are you mad? There is no Zeus.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What are you saying now? Who causes the rain to fall? Answer\r\nme that!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Why, 'tis these, and I will prove it. Have you ever seen it\r\nraining without clouds? Let Zeus then cause rain with a clear sky and\r\nwithout their presence!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. By Apollo! that is powerfully argued! For my own part, I\r\nalways thought it was Zeus pissing into a sieve. But tell me, who is it\r\nmakes the thunder, which I so much dread?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. 'Tis these, when they roll one over the other.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But how can that be? you most daring among men!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Being full of water, and forced to move along, they are of\r\nnecessity precipitated in rain, being fully distended with moisture from\r\nthe regions where they have been floating; hence they bump each other\r\nheavily and burst with great noise.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But is it not Zeus who forces them to move?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Not at all; 'tis aerial Whirlwind.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The Whirlwind! ah! I did not know that. So Zeus, it seems,\r\nhas no existence, and 'tis the Whirlwind that reigns in his stead? But\r\nyou have not yet told me what makes the roll of the thunder?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Have you not understood me then? I tell you, that the Clouds,\r\nwhen full of rain, bump against one another, and that, being inordinately\r\nswollen out, they burst with a great noise.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How can you make me credit that?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Take yourself as an example. When you have heartily gorged on\r\nstew at the Panathenaea, you get throes of stomach-ache and then suddenly\r\nyour belly resounds with prolonged growling.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Yes, yes, by Apollo! I suffer, I get colic, then the stew\r\nsets a-growling like thunder and finally bursts forth with a terrific\r\nnoise. At first, 'tis but a little gurgling _pappax, pappax_! then it\r\nincreases, _papapappax!_ and when I seek relief, why, 'tis thunder\r\nindeed, _papapappax! pappax!! papapappax!!!_ just like the clouds.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well then, reflect what a noise is produced by your belly,\r\nwhich is but small. Shall not the air, which is boundless, produce these\r\nmighty claps of thunder?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But tell me this. Whence comes the lightning, the dazzling\r\nflame, which at times consumes the man it strikes, at others hardly\r\nsinges him. Is it not plain, that 'tis Zeus hurling it at the perjurers?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Out upon the fool! the driveller! he still savours of the\r\ngolden age! If Zeus strikes at the perjurers, why has he not blasted\r\nSimon, Cleonymus and Theorus?[510] Of a surety, greater perjurers cannot\r\nexist. No, he strikes his own Temple, and Sunium, the promontory of\r\nAthens,[511] and the towering oaks. Now, why should he do that? An oak is\r\nno perjurer.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I cannot tell, but it seems to me well argued. What is the\r\nthunder then?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. When a dry wind ascends to the Clouds and gets shut into them,\r\nit blows them out like a bladder; finally, being too confined, it bursts\r\nthem, escapes with fierce violence and a roar to flash into flame by\r\nreason of its own impetuosity.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Forsooth, 'tis just what happened to me one day. 'Twas at\r\nthe feast of Zeus! I was cooking a sow's belly for my family and I had\r\nforgotten to slit it open. It swelled out and, suddenly bursting,\r\ndischarged itself right into my eyes and burnt my face.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Oh, mortal! you, who desire to instruct yourself in our great\r\nwisdom, the Athenians, the Greeks will envy you your good fortune. Only\r\nyou must have the memory and ardour for study, you must know how to stand\r\nthe tests, hold your own, go forward without feeling fatigue, caring but\r\nlittle for food, abstaining from wine, gymnastic exercises and other\r\nsimilar follies, in fact, you must believe as every man of intellect\r\nshould, that the greatest of all blessings is to live and think more\r\nclearly than the vulgar herd, to shine in the contests of words.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. If it be a question of hardiness for labour, of spending\r\nwhole nights at work, of living sparingly, of fighting my stomach and\r\nonly eating chick-pease, rest assured, I am as hard as an anvil.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Henceforward, following our example, you will recognize no\r\nother gods but Chaos, the Clouds and the Tongue, these three alone.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I would not speak to the others, even if I should meet them\r\nin the street; not a single sacrifice, not a libation, not a grain of\r\nincense for them!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Tell us boldly then what you want of us; you cannot fail to\r\nsucceed, if you honour and revere us and if you are resolved to become a\r\nclever man.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, sovereign goddesses, 'tis but a very small favour that I\r\nask of you; grant that I may distance all the Greeks by a hundred stadia\r\nin the art of speaking.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. We grant you this, and henceforward no eloquence shall more often\r\nsucceed with the people than your own.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. May the god shield me from possessing great eloquence! 'Tis\r\nnot what I want. I want to be able to turn bad lawsuits to my own\r\nadvantage and to slip through the fingers of my creditors.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. It shall be as you wish, for your ambitions are modest. Commit\r\nyourself fearlessly to our ministers, the sophists.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. This will I do, for I trust in you. Moreover there is no\r\ndrawing back, what with these cursed horses and this marriage, which has\r\neaten up my vitals. So let them do with me as they will; I yield my body\r\nto them. Come blows, come hunger, thirst, heat or cold, little matters it\r\nto me; they may flay me, if I only escape my debts, if only I win the\r\nreputation of being a bold rascal, a fine speaker, impudent, shameless, a\r\nbraggart, and adept at stringing lies, an old stager at quibbles, a\r\ncomplete table of the laws, a thorough rattle, a fox to slip through any\r\nhole; supple as a leathern strap, slippery as an eel, an artful fellow, a\r\nblusterer, a villain; a knave with a hundred faces, cunning, intolerable,\r\na gluttonous dog. With such epithets do I seek to be greeted; on these\r\nterms, they can treat me as they choose, and, if they wish, by Demeter!\r\nthey can turn me into sausages and serve me up to the philosophers.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Here have we a bold and well-disposed pupil indeed. When we shall\r\nhave taught you, your glory among the mortals will reach even to the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Wherein will that profit me?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. You will pass your whole life among us and will be the most\r\nenvied of men.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Shall I really ever see such happiness?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Clients will be everlastingly besieging your door in crowds,\r\nburning to get at you, to explain their business to you and to consult\r\nyou about their suits, which, in return for your ability, will bring you\r\nin great sums. But, Socrates, begin the lessons you want to teach this\r\nold man; rouse his mind, try the strength of his intelligence.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, tell me the kind of mind you have; 'tis important I know\r\nthis, that I may order my batteries against you in a new fashion.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Eh, what! in the name of the gods, are you purposing to\r\nassault me then?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. No. I only wish to ask you some questions. Have you any memory?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. That depends: if anything is owed me, my memory is\r\nexcellent, but if I owe, alas! I have none whatever.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Have you a natural gift for speaking?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. For speaking, no; for cheating, yes.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. How will you be able to learn then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Very easily, have no fear.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Thus, when I throw forth some philosophical thought anent\r\nthings celestial, you will seize it in its very flight?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Then I am to snap up wisdom much as a dog snaps up a morsel?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Oh! the ignoramus! the barbarian! I greatly fear, old man,\r\n'twill be needful for me to have recourse to blows. Now, let me hear what\r\nyou do when you are beaten.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I receive the blow, then wait a moment, take my witnesses\r\nand finally summon my assailant at law.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, take off your cloak.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Have I robbed you of anything?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. No, but 'tis usual to enter the school without your cloak.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But I am not come here to look for stolen goods.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Off with it, fool!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me, if I prove thoroughly attentive and learn with\r\nzeal, which of your disciples shall I resemble, do you think?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You will be the image of Chaerephon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! unhappy me! I shall then be but half alive?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. A truce to this chatter! follow me and no more of it.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. First give me a honey-cake, for to descend down there sets\r\nme all a-tremble; meseems 'tis the cave of Trophonius.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. But get in with you! What reason have you for thus dallying at\r\nthe door?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Good luck! you have courage; may you succeed, you, who, though\r\nalready so advanced in years, wish to instruct your mind with new studies\r\nand practise it in wisdom!\r\n\r\nCHORUS (_Parabasis_). Spectators! By Bacchus, whose servant I am, I will\r\nfrankly tell you the truth. May I secure both victory and renown as\r\ncertainly as I hold you for adept critics and as I regard this comedy as\r\nmy best. I wished to give you the first view of a work, which had cost me\r\nmuch trouble, but I withdrew, unjustly beaten by unskilful rivals.[512]\r\n'Tis you, oh, enlightened public, for whom I have prepared my piece, that\r\nI reproach with this. Nevertheless I shall never willingly cease to seek\r\nthe approval of the discerning. I have not forgotten the day, when men,\r\nwhom one is happy to have for an audience, received my 'Young Man' and my\r\n'Debauchee'[513] with so much favour in this very place. Then as yet\r\nvirgin, my Muse had not attained the legal age for maternity;[514] she\r\nhad to expose her first-born for another to adopt, and it has since grown\r\nup under your generous patronage. Ever since you have as good as sworn me\r\nyour faithful alliance. Thus, like Electra[515] of the poets, my comedy\r\nhas come to seek you to-day, hoping again to encounter such enlightened\r\nspectators. As far away as she can discern her Orestes, she will be able\r\nto recognize him by his curly head. And note her modest demeanour! She\r\nhas not sewn on a piece of hanging leather, thick and reddened at the\r\nend,[516] to cause laughter among the children; she does not rail at the\r\nbald, neither does she dance the cordax;[517] no old man is seen, who,\r\nwhile uttering his lines, batters his questioner with a stick to make his\r\npoor jests pass muster.[518] She does not rush upon the scene carrying a\r\ntorch and screaming, 'La, la! la, la!' No, she relies upon herself and\r\nher verses.... My value is so well known, that I take no further pride in\r\nit. I do not seek to deceive you, by reproducing the same subjects two or\r\nthree times; I always invent fresh themes to present before you, themes\r\nthat have no relation to each other and that are all clever. I attacked\r\nCleon[519] to his face and when he was all-powerful; but he has fallen,\r\nand now I have no desire to kick him when he is down. My rivals, on the\r\ncontrary, once that this wretched Hyperbolus has given them the cue, have\r\nnever ceased setting upon both him and his mother. First Eupolis\r\npresented his 'Maricas';[520] this was simply my 'Knights,' whom this\r\nplagiarist had clumsily furbished up again by adding to the piece an old\r\ndrunken woman, so that she might dance the cordax. 'Twas an old idea,\r\ntaken from Phrynichus, who caused his old hag to be devoured by a monster\r\nof the deep.[521] Then Hermippus[522] fell foul of Hyperbolus and now all\r\nthe others fall upon him and repeat my comparison of the eels. May those\r\nwho find amusement in their pieces not be pleased with mine, but as for\r\nyou, who love and applaud my inventions, why, posterity will praise your\r\ngood taste.\r\n\r\nOh, ruler of Olympus, all-powerful king of the gods, great Zeus, it is\r\nthou whom I first invoke; protect this chorus; and thou too, Posidon,\r\nwhose dread trident upheaves at the will of thy anger both the bowels of\r\nthe earth and the salty waves of the ocean. I invoke my illustrious\r\nfather, the divine Aether, the universal sustainer of life, and Phoebus,\r\nwho, from the summit of his chariot, sets the world aflame with his\r\ndazzling rays, Phoebus, a mighty deity amongst the gods and adored\r\namongst mortals.\r\n\r\nMost wise spectators, lend us all your attention. Give heed to our just\r\nreproaches. There exist no gods to whom this city owes more than it does\r\nto us, whom alone you forget. Not a sacrifice, not a libation is there\r\nfor those who protect you! Have you decreed some mad expedition? Well! we\r\nthunder or we fall down in rain. When you chose that enemy of heaven, the\r\nPaphlagonian tanner,[523] for a general, we knitted our brow, we caused\r\nour wrath to break out; the lightning shot forth, the thunder pealed, the\r\nmoon deserted her course and the sun at once veiled his beam threatening\r\nno longer to give you light, if Cleon became general. Nevertheless you\r\nelected him; 'tis said, Athens never resolves upon some fatal step but\r\nthe gods turn these errors into her greatest gain. Do you wish that this\r\nelection should even now be a success for you? 'Tis a very simple thing\r\nto do; condemn this rapacious gull named Cleon[524] for bribery and\r\nextortion, fit a wooden collar tight round his neck, and your error will\r\nbe rectified and the commonweal will at once regain its old prosperity.\r\n\r\nAid me also, Phoebus, god of Delos, who reignest on the cragged peaks of\r\nCynthia;[525] and thou, happy virgin,[526] to whom the Lydian damsels\r\noffer pompous sacrifice in a temple of gold; and thou, goddess of our\r\ncountry, Athené, armed with the aegis, the protectress of Athens; and\r\nthou, who, surrounded by the Bacchanals of Delphi, roamest over the rocks\r\nof Parnassus shaking the flame of thy resinous torch, thou, Bacchus, the\r\ngod of revel and joy.\r\n\r\nAs we were preparing to come here, we were hailed by the Moon and were\r\ncharged to wish joy and happiness both to the Athenians and to their\r\nallies; further, she said that she was enraged and that you treated her\r\nvery shamefully, her, who does not pay you in words alone, but who\r\nrenders you all real benefits. Firstly, thanks to her, you save at least\r\na drachma each month for lights, for each, as he is leaving home at\r\nnight, says, \"Slave, buy no torches, for the moonlight is\r\nbeautiful,\"--not to name a thousand other benefits. Nevertheless you do\r\nnot reckon the days correctly and your calendar is naught but\r\nconfusion.[527] Consequently the gods load her with threats each time\r\nthey get home and are disappointed of their meal, because the festival\r\nhas not been kept in the regular order of time. When you should be\r\nsacrificing, you are putting to the torture or administering justice. And\r\noften, we others, the gods, are fasting in token of mourning for the\r\ndeath of Memnon or Sarpedon,[528] while you are devoting yourselves to\r\njoyous libations. 'Tis for this, that last year, when the lot would have\r\ninvested Hyperbolus[529] with the duty of Amphictyon, we took his crown\r\nfrom him, to teach him that time must be divided according to the phases\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. By Respiration, the Breath of Life! By Chaos! By the Air! I\r\nhave never seen a man so gross, so inept, so stupid, so forgetful. All\r\nthe little quibbles, which I teach him, he forgets even before he has\r\nlearnt them. Yet I will not give it up, I will make him come out here\r\ninto the open air. Where are you, Strepsiades? Come, bring your couch out\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But the bugs will not allow me to bring it.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Have done with such nonsense! place it there and pay attention.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well, here I am.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Good! Which science of all those you have never been taught, do\r\nyou wish to learn first? The measures, the rhythms or the verses?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, the measures; the flour dealer cheated me out of two\r\n_choenixes_ the other day.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. 'Tis not about that I ask you, but which, according to you, is\r\nthe best measure, the trimeter or the tetrameter?[530]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The one I prefer is the semisextarius.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You talk nonsense, my good fellow.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I will wager your tetrameter is the semisextarius.[531]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Plague seize the dunce and the fool! Come, perchance you will\r\nlearn the rhythms quicker.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Will the rhythms supply me with food?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. First they will help you to be pleasant in company, then to\r\nknow what is meant by oenoplian rhythm[532] and what by the\r\ndactylic.[533]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Of the dactyl? I know that quite well.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What is it then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, 'tis this finger; formerly, when a child, I used this\r\none.[534]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You are as low-minded as you are stupid.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But, wretched man, I do not want to learn all this.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Then what _do_ you want to know?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Not that, not that, but the art of false reasoning.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. But you must first learn other things. Come, what are the male\r\nquadrupeds?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I know the males thoroughly. Do you take me for a fool\r\nthen? The ram, the buck, the bull, the dog, the pigeon.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Do you see what you are doing; is not the female pigeon called\r\nthe same as the male?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How else? Come now?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. How else? With you then 'tis pigeon and pigeon!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis true, by Posidon! but what names do you want me to give\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Term the female pigeonnette and the male pigeon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Pigeonnette! hah! by the Air! That's splendid! for that\r\nlesson bring out your kneading-trough and I will fill him with flour to\r\nthe brim.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. There you are wrong again; you make _trough_ masculine and it\r\nshould be feminine.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What? if I say _him_, do I make the _trough_ masculine?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Assuredly! would you not say him for Cleonymus?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Then trough is of the same gender as Cleonymus?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! good sir! Cleonymus never had a kneading-trough;[535] he\r\nused a round mortar for the purpose. But come, tell me what I _should_\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. For trough you should say _her_ as you would for Sostraté.[536]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. _Her_?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. In this manner you make it truly female.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. That's it! _Her_ for trough and _her_ for Cleonymus.[537]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Now I must teach you to distinguish the masculine proper names\r\nfrom those that are feminine.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! I know the female names well.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Name some then.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Lysilla, Philinna, Clitagora, Demetria.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. And what are masculine names?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. They are countless--Philoxenus, Melesias, Amynias.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. But, wretched man, the last two are not masculine.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. You do not reckon them masculine?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Not at all. If you met Amynias, how would you hail him?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How? Why, I should shout, \"Hi! hither, Amyni_a_!\"[538]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Do you see? 'tis a female name that you give him.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And is it not rightly done, since he refuses military\r\nservice? But what use is there in learning what we all know?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You know nothing about it. Come, lie down there.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What for?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Ponder awhile over matters that interest you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I pray you, not there! but, if I must lie down and\r\nponder, let me lie on the ground.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. 'Tis out of the question. Come! on to the couch!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What cruel fate! What a torture the bugs will this day put\r\nme to!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Ponder and examine closely, gather your thoughts together, let\r\nyour mind turn to every side of things; if you meet with a difficulty,\r\nspring quickly to some other idea; above all, keep your eyes away from\r\nall gentle sleep.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, woe, woe! oh, woe, woe!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What ails you? why do you cry so?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! I am a dead man! Here are these cursed Corinthians[539]\r\nadvancing upon me from all corners of the couch; they are biting me, they\r\nare gnawing at my sides, they are drinking all my blood, they are\r\ntwitching off my testicles, they are exploring all up my back, they are\r\nkilling me!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Not so much wailing and clamour, if you please.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How can I obey? I have lost my money and my complexion, my\r\nblood and my slippers, and to cap my misery, I must keep awake on this\r\ncouch, when scarce a breath of life is left in me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well now! what are you doing? are you reflecting?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Yes, by Posidon!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What about?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Whether the bugs will not entirely devour me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. May death seize you, accursed man!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! it has already.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, no giving way! Cover up your head; the thing to do is to\r\nfind an ingenious alternative.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. An alternative! ah! I only wish one would come to me from\r\nwithin these coverlets!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Hold! let us see what our fellow is doing. Ho! you! are you\r\nasleep?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, by Apollo!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Have you got hold of anything?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, nothing whatever.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Nothing at all!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, nothing but my tool, which I've got in my hand.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Are you not going to cover your head immediately and ponder?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Over what? Come, Socrates, tell me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Think first what you want, and then tell me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But I have told you a thousand times what I want. 'Tis not\r\nto pay any of my creditors.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, wrap yourself up; concentrate your mind, which wanders\r\ntoo lightly, study every detail, scheme and examine thoroughly.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, woe! woe! oh dear! oh dear!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Keep yourself quiet, and if any notion troubles you, put it\r\nquickly aside, then resume it and think over it again.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. My dear little Socrates!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What is it, old greybeard?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I have a scheme for not paying my debts.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Let us hear it.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Tell me, if I purchased a Thessalian witch, I could make the\r\nmoon descend during the night and shut it, like a mirror, into a round\r\nbox and there keep it carefully....\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. How would you gain by that?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How? Why, if the moon did not rise, I would have no interest\r\nto pay.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Why so?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Because money is lent by the month.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Good! but I am going to propose another trick to you. If you\r\nwere condemned to pay five talents, how would you manage to quash that\r\nverdict? Tell me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. How? how? I don't know, I must think.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Do you always shut your thoughts within yourself. Let your\r\nideas fly in the air, like a may-bug, tied by the foot with a thread.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I have found a very clever way to annul that conviction; you\r\nwill admit that much yourself.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. What is it?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Have you ever seen a beautiful, transparent stone at the\r\ndruggists, with which you may kindle fire?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You mean a crystal lens.[540]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Yes.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well, what then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. If I placed myself with this stone in the sun and a long way\r\noff from the clerk, while he was writing out the conviction, I could make\r\nall the wax, upon which the words were written, melt.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well thought out, by the Graces!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! I am delighted to have annulled the decree that was to\r\ncost me five talents.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Come, take up this next question quickly.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Which?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. If, when summoned to court, you were in danger of losing your\r\ncase for want of witnesses, how would you make the conviction fall upon\r\nyour opponent?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis very simple and most easy.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Let me hear.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. This way. If another case had to be pleaded before mine was\r\ncalled, I should run and hang myself.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You talk rubbish!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Not so, by the gods! if I was dead, no action could lie\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You are merely beating the air. Begone! I will give you no more\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why not? Oh! Socrates! in the name of the gods!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. But you forget as fast as you learn. Come, what was the thing I\r\ntaught you first? Tell me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! let me see. What was the first thing? What was it then?\r\nAh! that thing in which we knead the bread, oh! my god! what do you call\r\nit?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Plague take the most forgetful and silliest of old addlepates!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Alas! what a calamity! what will become of me? I am undone\r\nif I do not learn how to ply my tongue. Oh! Clouds! give me good advice.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Old man, we counsel you, if you have brought up a son, to send\r\nhim to learn in your stead.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Undoubtedly I have a son, as well endowed as the best, but\r\nhe is unwilling to learn. What will become of me?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. And you don't make him obey you?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. You see, he is big and strong; moreover, through his mother\r\nhe is a descendant of those fine birds, the race of Coesyra.[541]\r\nNevertheless, I will go and find him, and if he refuses, I will turn him\r\nout of the house. Go in, Socrates, and wait for me awhile.\r\n\r\nCHORUS (_to Socrates_). Do you understand, that, thanks to us, you will\r\nbe loaded with benefits? Here is a man, ready to obey you in all things.\r\nYou see how he is carried away with admiration and enthusiasm. Profit by\r\nit to clip him as short as possible; fine chances are all too quickly\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, by the Clouds! you stay no longer here; go and devour\r\nthe ruins of your uncle Megacles' fortune.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Oh! my poor father! what has happened to you? By the\r\nOlympian Zeus! you are no longer in your senses!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. See! see! \"the Olympian Zeus.\" Oh! the fool! to believe in\r\nZeus at your age!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is there in that to make you laugh?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. You are then a tiny little child, if you credit such\r\nantiquated rubbish! But come here, that I may teach you; I will tell you\r\nsomething very necessary to know to be a man; but you will not repeat it\r\nto anybody.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Come, what is it?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Just now you swore by Zeus.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Aye, that I did.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Do you see how good it is to learn? Phidippides, there is no\r\nZeus.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is there then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis the Whirlwind, that has driven out Jupiter and is King\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Go to! what drivel!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Know it to be the truth.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And who says so?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Tis Socrates, the Melian,[542] and Chaerephon, who knows\r\nhow to measure the jump of a flea.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Have you reached such a pitch of madness that you believe\r\nthose bilious fellows?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Use better language, and do not insult men who are clever\r\nand full of wisdom, who, to economize, are never shaved, shun the\r\ngymnasia and never go to the baths, while you, you only await my death to\r\neat up my wealth. But come, come as quickly as you can to learn in my\r\nstead.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what good can be learnt of them?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What good indeed? Why, all human knowledge. Firstly, you\r\nwill know yourself grossly ignorant. But await me here awhile.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Alas! what is to be done? My father has lost his wits. Must\r\nI have him certificated for lunacy, or must I order his coffin?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Come! what kind of bird is this? tell me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Good! And this female?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The same for both? You make me laugh! For the future you\r\nwill call this one a pigeonnette and the other a pigeon.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. A pigeonnette! These then are the fine things you have just\r\nlearnt at the school of these sons of the Earth![543]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And many others; but what I learnt I forgot at once, because\r\nI am too old.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. So this is why you have lost your cloak?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I have not lost it, I have consecrated it to Philosophy.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what have you done with your sandals, you poor fool?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. If I have lost them, it is for what was necessary, just as\r\nPericles did.[544] But come, move yourself, let us go in; if necessary,\r\ndo wrong to obey your father. When you were six years old and still\r\nlisped, 'twas I who obeyed you. I remember at the feasts of Zeus you had\r\na consuming wish for a little chariot and I bought it for you with the\r\nfirst obolus which I received as a juryman in the Courts.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. You will soon repent of what you ask me to do.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! now I am happy! He obeys. Here, Socrates, here! Come out\r\nquick! Here I am bringing you my son; he refused, but I have persuaded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Why, he is but a child yet. He is not used to these baskets, in\r\nwhich we suspend our minds.[545]\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. To make you better used to them, I would you were hung.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. A curse upon you! you insult your master!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. \"I would you were hung!\" What a stupid speech! and so\r\nemphatically spoken! How can one ever get out of an accusation with such\r\na tone, summon witnesses or touch or convince? And yet when we think,\r\nHyperbolus learnt all this for one talent!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Rest undisturbed and teach him. 'Tis a most intelligent\r\nnature. Even when quite little he amused himself at home with making\r\nhouses, carving boats, constructing little chariots of leather, and\r\nunderstood wonderfully how to make frogs out of pomegranate rinds. Teach\r\nhim both methods of reasoning, the strong and also the weak, which by\r\nfalse arguments triumphs over the strong; if not the two, at least the\r\nfalse, and that in every possible way.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. 'Tis Just and Unjust Discourse themselves that shall instruct\r\nhim.[546]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I go, but forget it not, he must always, always be able to\r\nconfound the true.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Come here! Shameless as you may be, will you dare to show\r\nyour face to the spectators?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Take me where you list. I seek a throng, so that I may\r\nthe better annihilate you.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Annihilate me! Do you forget who you are?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I am Reasoning.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Yes, the weaker Reasoning.[547]\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. But I triumph over you, who claim to be the stronger.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. By what cunning shifts, pray?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. By the invention of new maxims.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. ... which are received with favour by these fools.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Say rather, by these wiseacres.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am going to destroy you mercilessly.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. How pray? Let us see you do it.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. By saying what is true.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I shall retort and shall very soon have the better of\r\nyou. First, I maintain that justice has no existence.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Has no existence?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. No existence! Why, where are they?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. With the gods.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. How then, if justice exists, was Zeus not put to death\r\nfor having put his father in chains?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Bah! this is enough to turn my stomach! A basin, quick!\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You are an old driveller and stupid withal.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. And you a debauchee and a shameless fellow.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Hah! What sweet expressions!\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. An impious buffoon!\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You crown me with roses and with lilies.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. A parricide.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Why, you shower gold upon me.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Formerly, 'twas a hailstorm of blows.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. I deck myself with your abuse.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. What impudence!\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What tomfoolery!\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. 'Tis because of you that the youth no longer attends the\r\nschools. The Athenians will soon recognize what lessons you teach those\r\nwho are fools enough to believe you.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You are overwhelmed with wretchedness.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. And you, you prosper. Yet you were poor when you said, \"I\r\nam the Mysian Telephus,\"[548] and used to stuff your wallet with maxims\r\nof Pandeletus[549] to nibble at.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Oh! the beautiful wisdom, of which you are now\r\nboasting!\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Madman! But yet madder the city that keeps you, you, the\r\ncorrupter of its youth!\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. 'Tis not you who will teach this young man; you are as\r\nold and out of date as Saturn.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Nay, it will certainly be I, if he does not wish to be\r\nlost and to practise verbosity only.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE (_to Phidippides_). Come hither and leave him to beat\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE (_to Unjust Discourse_). Evil be unto you, if you touch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. A truce to your quarrellings and abuse! But expound, you, what\r\nyou taught us formerly, and you, your new doctrine. Thus, after hearing\r\neach of you argue, he will be able to choose betwixt the two schools.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am quite agreeable.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. And I too.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Who is to speak first?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Let it be my opponent, he has my full consent; then I\r\nwill follow upon the very ground he shall have chosen and shall shatter\r\nhim with a hail of new ideas and subtle fancies; if after that he dares\r\nto breathe another word, I shall sting him in the face and in the eyes\r\nwith our maxims, which are as keen as the sting of a wasp, and he will\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Here are two rivals confident in their powers of oratory and in\r\nthe thoughts over which they have pondered so long. Let us see which will\r\ncome triumphant out of the contest. This wisdom, for which my friends\r\nmaintain such a persistent fight, is in great danger. Come then, you, who\r\ncrowned men of other days with so many virtues, plead the cause dear to\r\nyou, make yourself known to us.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Very well, I will tell you what was the old education,\r\nwhen I used to teach justice with so much success and when modesty was\r\nheld in veneration. Firstly, it was required of a child, that it should\r\nnot utter a word. In the street, when they went to the music-school, all\r\nthe youths of the same district marched lightly clad and ranged in good\r\norder, even when the snow was falling in great flakes. At the master's\r\nhouse they had to stand, their legs apart, and they were taught to sing\r\neither, \"Pallas, the Terrible, who overturneth cities,\" or \"A noise\r\nresounded from afar\"[550] in the solemn tones of the ancient harmony. If\r\nanyone indulged in buffoonery or lent his voice any of the soft\r\ninflexions, like those which to-day the disciples of Phrynis[551] take so\r\nmuch pains to form, he was treated as an enemy of the Muses and\r\nbelaboured with blows. In the wrestling school they would sit with\r\noutstretched legs and without display of any indecency to the curious.\r\nWhen they rose, they would smooth over the sand, so as to leave no trace\r\nto excite obscene thoughts. Never was a child rubbed with oil below the\r\nbelt; the rest of their bodies thus retained its fresh bloom and down,\r\nlike a velvety peach. They were not to be seen approaching a lover and\r\nthemselves rousing his passion by soft modulation of the voice and\r\nlustful gaze. At table, they would not have dared, before those older\r\nthan themselves, to have taken a radish, an aniseed or a leaf of parsley,\r\nand much less eat fish or thrushes or cross their legs.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What antiquated rubbish! Have we got back to the days\r\nof the festivals of Zeus Polieus,[552] to the Buphonia, to the time of\r\nthe poet Cecydes[553] and the golden cicadas?[554]\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. 'Tis nevertheless by suchlike teaching I built up the men\r\nof Marathon. But you, you teach the children of to-day to bundle\r\nthemselves quickly into their clothes, and I am enraged when I see them\r\nat the Panathenaea forgetting Athené while they dance, and covering\r\nthemselves with their bucklers. Hence, young man, dare to range yourself\r\nbeside me, who follow justice and truth; you will then be able to shun\r\nthe public place, to refrain from the baths, to blush at all that is\r\nshameful, to fire up if your virtue is mocked at, to give place to your\r\nelders, to honour your parents, in short, to avoid all that is evil. Be\r\nmodesty itself, and do not run to applaud the dancing girls; if you\r\ndelight in such scenes, some courtesan will cast you her apple and your\r\nreputation will be done for. Do not bandy words with your father, nor\r\ntreat him as a dotard, nor reproach the old man, who has cherished you,\r\nwith his age.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. If you listen to him, by Bacchus! you will be the image\r\nof the sons of Hippocrates[555] and will be called _mother's great\r\nninny_.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. No, but you will pass your days at the gymnasia, glowing\r\nwith strength and health; you will not go to the public place to cackle\r\nand wrangle as is done nowadays; you will not live in fear that you may\r\nbe dragged before the courts for some trifle exaggerated by quibbling.\r\nBut you will go down to the Academy[556] to run beneath the sacred olives\r\nwith some virtuous friend of your own age, your head encircled with the\r\nwhite reed, enjoying your ease and breathing the perfume of the yew and\r\nof the fresh sprouts of the poplar, rejoicing in the return of springtide\r\nand gladly listening to the gentle rustle of the plane-tree and the elm.\r\nIf you devote yourself to practising my precepts, your chest will be\r\nstout, your colour glowing, your shoulders broad, your tongue short, your\r\nhips muscular, but your penis small. But if you follow the fashions of\r\nthe day, you will be pallid in hue, have narrow shoulders, a narrow\r\nchest, a long tongue, small hips and a big tool; you will know how to\r\nspin forth long-winded arguments on law. You will be persuaded also to\r\nregard as splendid everything that is shameful and as shameful everything\r\nthat is honourable; in a word, you will wallow in debauchery like\r\nAntimachus.[557]\r\n\r\nCHORUS. How beautiful, high-souled, brilliant is this wisdom that you\r\npractise! What a sweet odour of honesty is emitted by your discourse!\r\nHappy were those men of other days who lived when you were honoured! And\r\nyou, seductive talker, come, find some fresh arguments, for your rival\r\nhas done wonders. Bring out against him all the battery of your wit, if\r\nyou desire to beat him and not to be laughed out of court.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. At last! I was choking with impatience, I was burning\r\nto upset all his arguments! If I am called the Weaker Reasoning in the\r\nschools, 'tis precisely because I was the first before all others to\r\ndiscover the means to confute the laws and the decrees of justice. To\r\ninvoke solely the weaker arguments and yet triumph is a talent worth more\r\nthan a hundred thousand drachmae. But see how I shall batter down the\r\nsort of education of which he is so proud. Firstly, he forbids you to\r\nbathe in hot water. What grounds have you for condemning hot baths?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Because they are baneful and enervate men.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Enough said! Oh! you poor wrestler! From the very\r\noutset I have seized you and hold you round the middle; you cannot escape\r\nme. Tell me, of all the sons of Zeus, who had the stoutest heart, who\r\nperformed the most doughty deeds?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. None, in my opinion, surpassed Heracles.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Where have you ever seen cold baths called 'Baths of\r\nHeracles'?[558] And yet who was braver than he?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. 'Tis because of such quibbles, that the baths are seen\r\ncrowded with young folk, who chatter there the livelong day while the\r\ngymnasia remain empty.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Next you condemn the habit of frequenting the\r\nmarket-place, while I approve this. If it were wrong Homer would never\r\nhave made Nestor[559] speak in public as well as all his wise heroes. As\r\nfor the art of speaking, he tells you, young men should not practise it;\r\nI hold the contrary. Furthermore he preaches chastity to them. Both\r\nprecepts are equally harmful. Have you ever seen chastity of any use to\r\nanyone? Answer and try to confute me.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. To many; for instance, Peleus won a sword thereby.[560]\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. A sword! Ah! what a fine present to make him! Poor\r\nwretch! Hyperbolus, the lamp-seller, thanks to his villainy, has gained\r\nmore than ... I do not know how many talents, but certainly no sword.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Peleus owed it to his chastity that he became the husband\r\nof Thetis.[561]\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. ... who left him in the lurch, for he was not the most\r\nardent; in those nocturnal sports between two sheets, which so please\r\nwomen, he possessed but little merit. Get you gone, you are but an old\r\nfool. But you, young man, just consider a little what this temperance\r\nmeans and the delights of which it deprives you--young fellows, women,\r\nplay, dainty dishes, wine, boisterous laughter. And what is life worth\r\nwithout these? Then, if you happen to commit one of these faults inherent\r\nin human weakness, some seduction or adultery, and you are caught in the\r\nact, you are lost, if you cannot speak. But follow my teaching and you\r\nwill be able to satisfy your passions, to dance, to laugh, to blush at\r\nnothing. Are you surprised in adultery? Then up and tell the husband you\r\nare not guilty, and recall to him the example of Zeus, who allowed\r\nhimself to be conquered by love and by women. Being but a mortal, can you\r\nbe stronger than a god?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. And if your pupil gets impaled, his hairs plucked out,\r\nand he is seared with a hot ember,[562] how are you going to prove to him\r\nthat he is not a filthy debauchee?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. And wherein lies the harm of being so?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Is there anything worse than to have such a character?\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Now what will you say, if I beat you even on this\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. I should certainly have to be silent then.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well then, reply! Our advocates, what are they?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Nothing is more true. And our tragic poets?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well said again. And our demagogues?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. Low scum.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. You admit that you have spoken nonsense. And the\r\nspectators, what are they for the most part? Look at them.\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am looking at them.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. Well! What do you see?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. By the gods, they are nearly all low scum. See, this one\r\nI know to be such and that one and that other with the long hair.\r\n\r\nUNJUST DISCOURSE. What have you to say, then?\r\n\r\nJUST DISCOURSE. I am beaten. Debauchees! in the name of the gods, receive\r\nmy cloak;[563] I pass over to your ranks.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Well then! do you take away your son or do you wish me to teach\r\nhim how to speak?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Teach him, chastise him and do not fail to sharpen his\r\ntongue well, on one side for petty law-suits and on the other for\r\nimportant cases.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Make yourself easy, I shall return to you an accomplished\r\nsophist.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Very pale then and thoroughly hang-dog-looking.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Take him with you.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I do assure you, you will repent it.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Judges, we are all about to tell you what you will gain by\r\nawarding us the crown as equity requires of you. In spring, when you wish\r\nto give your fields the first dressing, we will rain upon you first; the\r\nothers shall wait. Then we will watch over your corn and over your\r\nvine-stocks; they will have no excess to fear, neither of heat nor of\r\nwet. But if a mortal dares to insult the goddesses of the Clouds, let him\r\nthink of the ills we shall pour upon him. For him neither wine nor any\r\nharvest at all! Our terrible slings will mow down his young olive plants\r\nand his vines. If he is making bricks, it will rain, and our round\r\nhailstones will break the tiles of his roof. If he himself marries or any\r\nof his relations or friends, we shall cause rain to fall the whole night\r\nlong. Verily, he would prefer to live in Egypt[564] than to have given\r\nthis iniquitous verdict.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Another four, three, two days, then the eve, then the day,\r\nthe fatal day of payment! I tremble, I quake, I shudder, for 'tis the day\r\nof the old moon and the new.[565] Then all my creditors take the oath,\r\npay their deposits,[566] swear my downfall and my ruin. As for me, I\r\nbeseech them to be reasonable, to be just, \"My friend, do not demand this\r\nsum, wait a little for this other and give me time for this third one.\"\r\nThen they will pretend that at this rate they will never be repaid, will\r\naccuse me of bad faith and will threaten me with the law. Well then, let\r\nthem sue me! I care nothing for that, if only Phidippides has learnt to\r\nspeak fluently. I go to find out, let me knock at the door of the\r\nschool.... Ho! slave, slave!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Welcome! Strepsiades!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Welcome! Socrates! But first take this sack (_offers him a\r\nsack of flour_); it is right to reward the master with some present. And\r\nmy son, whom you took off lately, has he learnt this famous reasoning,\r\ntell me.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. He has learnt it.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What a good thing! Oh! thou divine Knavery!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. You will win just as many causes as you choose.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Even if I have borrowed before witnesses?\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. So much the better, even if there are a thousand of 'em!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Then I am going to shout with all my might. \"Woe to the\r\nusurers, woe to their capital and their interest and their compound\r\ninterest! You shall play me no more bad turns. My son is being taught\r\nthere, his tongue is being sharpened into a double-edged weapon; he is my\r\ndefender, the saviour of my house, the ruin of my foes! His poor father\r\nwas crushed down with misfortune and he delivers him.\" Go and call him to\r\nme quickly. Oh! my child! my dear little one! run forward to your\r\nfather's voice!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Here he is.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, my friend, my dearest friend!\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Take your son, and get you gone.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, my son! oh! oh! what a pleasure to see your pallor! You\r\nare ready first to deny and then to contradict; 'tis as clear as noon.\r\nWhat a child of your country you are! How your lips quiver with the\r\nfamous, \"What have you to say now?\" How well you know, I am certain, to\r\nput on the look of a victim, when it is you who are making both victims\r\nand dupes! and what a truly Attic glance! Come, 'tis for you to save me,\r\nseeing it is you who have ruined me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What is it you fear then?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The day of the old and the new.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Is there then a day of the old and the new?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The day on which they threaten to pay deposit against me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Then so much the worse for those who have deposited! for\r\n'tis not possible for one day to be two.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Why, undoubtedly, unless a woman can be both old and young\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But so runs the law.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think the meaning of the law is quite misunderstood.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What does it mean?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Old Solon loved the people.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What has that to do with the old day and the new?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. He has fixed two days for the summons, the last day of the\r\nold moon and the first day of the new; but the deposits must only be paid\r\non the first day of the new moon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And why did he also name the last day of the old?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. So, my dear sir, that the debtors, being there the day\r\nbefore, might free themselves by mutual agreement, or that else, if not,\r\nthe creditor might begin his action on the morning of the new moon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why then do the magistrates have the deposits paid on the\r\nlast of the month and not the next day?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think they do as the gluttons do, who are the first to\r\npounce upon the dishes. Being eager to carry off these deposits, they\r\nhave them paid in a day too soon.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Splendid! Ah! poor brutes,[567] who serve for food to us\r\nclever folk! You are only down here to swell the number, true blockheads,\r\nsheep for shearing, heap of empty pots! Hence I will sound the note of\r\nvictory for my son and myself. \"Oh! happy, Strepsiades! what cleverness\r\nis thine! and what a son thou hast here!\" Thus my friends and my\r\nneighbours will say, jealous at seeing me gain all my suits. But come in,\r\nI wish to regale you first.\r\n\r\nPASIAS (_to his witness_). A man should never lend a single obolus.\r\n'Twould be better to put on a brazen face at the outset than to get\r\nentangled in such matters. I want to see my money again and I bring you\r\nhere to-day to attest the loan. I am going to make a foe of a neighbour;\r\nbut, as long as I live, I do not wish my country to have to blush for me.\r\nCome, I am going to summon Strepsiades.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Who is this?\r\n\r\nPASIAS. ... for the old day and the new.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I call you to witness, that he has named two days. What do\r\nyou want of me?\r\n\r\nPASIAS. I claim of you the twelve minae, which you borrowed from me to\r\nbuy the dapple-grey horse.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. A horse! do you hear him? I, who detest horses, as is well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. I call Zeus to witness, that you swore by the gods to return them\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Because at that time, by Zeus! Phidippides did not yet know\r\nthe irrefutable argument.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Would you deny the debt on that account?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. If not, what use is his science to me?\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Will you dare to swear by the gods that you owe me nothing?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. By which gods?\r\n\r\nPASIAS. By Zeus, Hermes and Posidon!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, I would give three obols for the pleasure of swearing\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Woe upon you, impudent knave!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! what a fine wine-skin you would make if flayed!\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Heaven! he jeers at me!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. It would hold six gallons easily.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. By great Zeus! by all the gods! you shall not scoff at me with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! how you amuse me with your gods! how ridiculous it seems\r\nto a sage to hear Zeus invoked.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Your blasphemies will one day meet their reward. But, come, will\r\nyou repay me my money, yes or no? Answer me, that I may go.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Wait a moment, I am going to give you a distinct answer.\r\n(_Goes indoors and returns immediately with a kneading-trough._)\r\n\r\nPASIAS. What do you think he will do?\r\n\r\nWITNESS. He will pay the debt.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Where is the man who demands money? Tell me, what is this?\r\n\r\nPASIAS. Him? Why he is your kneading-trough.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And you dare to demand money of me, when you are so\r\nignorant? I will not return an obolus to anyone who says _him_ instead of\r\n_her_ for a kneading-trough.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. You will not repay?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Not if I know it. Come, an end to this, pack off as quick as\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\nPASIAS. I go, but, may I die, if it be not to pay my deposit for a\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Very well! 'Twill be so much more to the bad to add to the\r\ntwelve minae. But truly it makes me sad, for I do pity a poor simpleton\r\nwho says _him_ for a kneading-trough.\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Woe! ah woe is me!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Hold! who is this whining fellow? Can it be one of the gods\r\nof Carcinus?[568]\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Do you want to know who I am? I am a man of misfortune!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Get on your way then.\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Oh! cruel god! Oh Fate, who hath broken the wheels of my\r\nchariot! Oh, Pallas, thou hast undone me![569]\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What ill has Tlepolemus done you?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Instead of jeering me, friend, make your son return me the money\r\nhe has had of me; I am already unfortunate enough.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What money?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. The money he borrowed of me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. You have indeed had misfortune, it seems to me.\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Yes, by the gods! I have been thrown from a chariot.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why then drivel as if you had fallen from an ass?[570]\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Am I drivelling because I demand my money?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No, no, you cannot be in your right senses.\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Why?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. No doubt your poor wits have had a shake.\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. But by Hermes! I will sue you at law, if you do not pay me.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Just tell me; do you think it is always fresh water that\r\nZeus lets fall every time it rains, or is it always the same water that\r\nthe sun pumps over the earth?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. I neither know, nor care.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. And actually you would claim the right to demand your money,\r\nwhen you know not a syllable of these celestial phenomena?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. If you are short, pay me the interest, at any rate.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What kind of animal is interest?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. What? Does not the sum borrowed go on growing, growing every\r\nmonth, each day as the time slips by?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well put. But do you believe there is more water in the sea\r\nnow than there was formerly?\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. No, 'tis just the same quantity. It cannot increase.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Thus, poor fool, the sea, that receives the rivers, never\r\ngrows, and yet you would have your money grow? Get you gone, away with\r\nyou, quick! Ho! bring me the ox-goad!\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. Hither! you witnesses there!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Come, what are you waiting for? Will you not budge, old nag!\r\n\r\nAMYNIAS. What an insult!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Unless you get a-trotting, I shall catch you and prick up\r\nyour behind, you sorry packhorse! Ah! you start, do you? I was about to\r\ndrive you pretty fast, I tell you--you and your wheels and your chariot!\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Whither does the passion of evil lead! here is a perverse old\r\nman, who wants to cheat his creditors; but some mishap, which will\r\nspeedily punish this rogue for his shameful schemings, cannot fail to\r\novertake him from to-day. For a long time he has been burning to have his\r\nson know how to fight against all justice and right and to gain even the\r\nmost iniquitous causes against his adversaries every one. I think this\r\nwish is going to be fulfilled. But mayhap, mayhap, he will soon wish his\r\nson were dumb rather!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! oh! neighbours, kinsmen, fellow-citizens, help! help! to\r\nthe rescue, I am being beaten! Oh! my head! oh! my jaw! Scoundrel! do you\r\nbeat your own father!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Yes, father, I do.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. See! he admits he is beating me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Undoubtedly I do.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. You villain, you parricide, you gallows-bird!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Go on, repeat your epithets, call me a thousand other names,\r\nan it please you. The more you curse, the greater my amusement!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! you infamous cynic!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. How fragrant the perfume breathed forth in your words.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Do you beat your own father?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Aye, by Zeus! and I am going to show you that I do right in\r\nbeating you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh, wretch! can it be right to beat a father?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I will prove it to you, and you shall own yourself\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Own myself vanquished on a point like this?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. 'Tis the easiest thing in the world. Choose whichever of the\r\ntwo reasonings you like.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Of which reasonings?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. The Stronger and the Weaker.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Miserable fellow! Why, 'tis I who had you taught how to\r\nrefute what is right, and now you would persuade me it is right a son\r\nshould beat his father.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I think I shall convince you so thoroughly that, when you\r\nhave heard me, you will not have a word to say.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Well, I am curious to hear what you have to say.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Consider well, old man, how you can best triumph over him. His\r\nbrazenness shows me that he thinks himself sure of his case; he has some\r\nargument which gives him nerve. Note the confidence in his look! But how\r\ndid the fight begin? tell the Chorus; you cannot help doing that much.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I will tell you what was the start of the quarrel. At the\r\nend of the meal you wot of, I bade him take his lyre and sing me the air\r\nof Simonides, which tells of the fleece of the ram.[571] He replied\r\nbluntly, that it was stupid, while drinking, to play the lyre and sing,\r\nlike a woman when she is grinding barley.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Why, by rights I ought to have beaten and kicked you the\r\nvery moment you told me to sing!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. That is just how he spoke to me in the house, furthermore he\r\nadded, that Simonides was a detestable poet. However, I mastered myself\r\nand for a while said nothing. Then I said to him, 'At least, take a\r\nmyrtle branch and recite a passage from Aeschylus to me.'--'For my own\r\npart,' he at once replied, 'I look upon Aeschylus as the first of poets,\r\nfor his verses roll superbly; 'tis nothing but incoherence, bombast and\r\nturgidness.' Yet still I smothered my wrath and said, 'Then recite one of\r\nthe famous pieces from the modern poets.' Then he commenced a piece in\r\nwhich Euripides shows, oh! horror! a brother, who violates his own\r\nuterine sister.[572] Then I could no longer restrain myself, and attacked\r\nhim with the most injurious abuse; naturally he retorted; hard words were\r\nhurled on both sides, and finally he sprang at me, broke my bones, bore\r\nme to earth, strangled and started killing me!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I was right. What! not praise Euripides, the greatest of our\r\npoets!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. He the greatest of our poets! Ah! if I but dared to speak!\r\nbut the blows would rain upon me harder than ever.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Undoubtedly, and rightly too.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Rightly! oh! what impudence! to me, who brought you up! when\r\nyou could hardly lisp, I guessed what you wanted. If you said _broo,\r\nbroo_, well, I brought you your milk; if you asked for _mam mam_, I gave\r\nyou bread; and you had no sooner said, _caca_, than I took you outside\r\nand held you out. And just now, when you were strangling me, I shouted, I\r\nbellowed that I would let all go; and you, you scoundrel, had not the\r\nheart to take me outside, so that here, though almost choking, I was\r\ncompelled to ease myself.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. Young men, your hearts must be panting with impatience. What is\r\nPhidippides going to say? If, after such conduct, he proves he has done\r\nwell, I would not give an obolus for the hide of old men. Come, you, who\r\nknow how to brandish and hurl the keen shafts of the new science, find a\r\nway to convince us, give your language an appearance of truth.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. How pleasant it is to know these clever new inventions and\r\nto be able to defy the established laws! When I thought only about\r\nhorses, I was not able to string three words together without a mistake,\r\nbut now that the master has altered and improved me and that I live in\r\nthis world of subtle thought, of reasoning and of meditation, I count on\r\nbeing able to prove satisfactorily that I have done well to thrash my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Mount your horse! By Zeus! I would rather defray the keep of\r\na four-in-hand team than be battered with blows.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I revert to what I was saying when you interrupted me. And\r\nfirst, answer me, did you beat me in my childhood?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, assuredly, for your good and in your own best interest.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Tell me, is it not right, that in turn I should beat you for\r\nyour good? since it is for a man's own best interest to be beaten. What!\r\nmust your body be free of blows, and not mine? am I not free-born too?\r\nthe children are to weep and the fathers go free?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But...\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. You will tell me, that according to the law, 'tis the lot of\r\nchildren to be beaten. But I reply that the old men are children twice\r\nover and that it is far more fitting to chastise them than the young, for\r\nthere is less excuse for their faults.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But the law nowhere admits that fathers should be treated\r\nthus.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Was not the legislator who carried this law a man like you\r\nand me? In those days he got men to believe him; then why should not I\r\ntoo have the right to establish for the future a new law, allowing\r\nchildren to beat their fathers in turn? We make you a present of all the\r\nblows which were received before this law, and admit that you thrashed us\r\nwith impunity. But look how the cocks and other animals fight with their\r\nfathers; and yet what difference is there betwixt them and ourselves,\r\nunless it be that they do not propose decrees?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. But if you imitate the cocks in all things, why don't you\r\nscratch up the dunghill, why don't you sleep on a perch?\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. That has no bearing on the case, good sir; Socrates would\r\nfind no connection, I assure you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Then do not beat at all, for otherwise you have only\r\nyourself to blame afterwards.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. What for?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I have the right to chastise you, and you to chastise your\r\nson, if you have one.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And if I have not, I shall have cried in vain, and you will\r\ndie laughing in my face.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What say you, all here present? It seems to me that he is\r\nright, and I am of opinion that they should be accorded their right. If\r\nwe think wrongly, 'tis but just we should be beaten.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Again, consider this other point.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. 'Twill be the death of me.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. But you will certainly feel no more anger because of the\r\nblows I have given you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Come, show me what profit I shall gain from it.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I shall beat my mother just as I have you.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What do you say? what's that you say? Hah! this is far worse\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. And what if I prove to you by our school reasoning, that one\r\nought to beat one's mother?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Ah! if you do that, then you will only have to throw\r\nyourself along with Socrates and his reasoning, into the Barathrum.[573]\r\nOh! Clouds! all our troubles emanate from you, from you, to whom I\r\nentrusted myself, body and soul.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. No, you alone are the cause, because you have pursued the path of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why did you not say so then, instead of egging on a poor\r\nignorant old man?\r\n\r\nCHORUS. We always act thus, when we see a man conceive a passion for what\r\nis evil; we strike him with some terrible disgrace, so that he may learn\r\nto fear the gods.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Alas! oh Clouds! 'tis hard indeed, but 'tis just! I ought\r\nnot to have cheated my creditors.... But come, my dear son, come with me\r\nto take vengeance on this wretched Chaerephon and on Socrates, who have\r\ndeceived us both.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. I shall do nothing against our masters.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! show some reverence for ancestral Zeus!\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Mark him and his ancestral Zeus! What a fool you are! Does\r\nany such being as Zeus exist?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Why, assuredly.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. No, a thousand times no! The ruler of the world is the\r\nWhirlwind, that has unseated Zeus.\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. He has not dethroned him. I believed it, because of this\r\nwhirligig here. Unhappy wretch that I am! I have taken a piece of clay to\r\nbe a god.\r\n\r\nPHIDIPPIDES. Very well! Keep your stupid nonsense for your own\r\nconsumption. (_Exit_.)\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Oh! what madness! I had lost my reason when I threw over the\r\ngods through Socrates' seductive phrases. Oh! good Hermes, do not destroy\r\nme in your wrath. Forgive me; their babbling had driven me crazy. Be my\r\ncouncillor. Shall I pursue them at law or shall I...? Order and I\r\nobey.--You are right, no law-suit; but up! let us burn down the home of\r\nthose praters. Here, Xanthias, here! take a ladder, come forth and arm\r\nyourself with an axe; now mount upon the school, demolish the roof, if\r\nyou love your master, and may the house fall in upon them, Ho! bring me a\r\nblazing torch! There is more than one of them, arch-impostors as they\r\nare, on whom I am determined to have vengeance.\r\n\r\nA DISCIPLE. Oh! oh!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. Come, torch, do your duty! Burst into full flame!\r\n\r\nDISCIPLE. What are you up to?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. What am I up to? Why, I am entering upon a subtle argument\r\nwith the beams of the house.\r\n\r\nSECOND DISCIPLE. Hullo! hullo! who is burning down our house?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. The man whose cloak you have appropriated.\r\n\r\nSECOND DISCIPLE. But we are dead men, dead men!\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. That is just exactly what I hope, unless my axe plays me\r\nfalse, or I fall and break my neck.\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Hi! you fellow on the roof, what are you doing up there?\r\n\r\nSTREPSIADES. I traverse the air and contemplate the sun.[574]\r\n\r\nSOCRATES. Ah! ah! woe is upon me! I am suffocating!\r\n\r\nCHAEREPHON. Ah! you insulted the gods! Ah! you studied the face of the\r\nmoon! Chase them, strike and beat them down! Forward! they have richly\r\ndeserved their fate--above all, by reason of their blasphemies.\r\n\r\nCHORUS. So let the Chorus file off the stage.

It is night-time.\r\n\r\n[471] The punishment most frequently inflicted upon slaves in the towns\r\nwas to send them into the country to work in the fields, but at the\r\nperiod when the 'Clouds' was presented, 424 B.C., the invasions of the\r\nPeloponnesians forbade the pursuit of agriculture. Moreover, there\r\nexisted the fear, that if the slaves were punished too harshly, they\r\nmight go over to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[472] Among the Greeks, each month was divided into three decades. The\r\nlast of the month was called [Greek: en_e kai nea], the day of the old\r\nand the new or the day of the new moon, and on that day interest, which\r\nit was customary to pay monthly, became due.\r\n\r\n[473] Literally, the horse marked with the [Greek: koppa] ([Symbol:\r\nLetter 'koppa']), a letter of the older Greek alphabet, afterwards\r\ndisused, which distinguished the thoroughbreds.\r\n\r\n[474] Phidippides dreams that he is driving in a chariot race, and that\r\nan opponent is trying to cut into his track.\r\n\r\n[475] There was a prize specially reserved for war-chariots in the games\r\nof the Athenian hippodrome; being heavier than the chariots generally\r\nused, they doubtless had to cover a lesser number of laps, which explains\r\nPhidippides' question.\r\n\r\n[476] The wife of Alcmaeon, a descendant of Nestor, who, driven from\r\nMessenia by the Heraclidae, came to settle in Athens in the twelfth\r\ncentury, and was the ancestor of the great family of the Alcmaeonidae,\r\nPericles and Alcibiades belonged to it.\r\n\r\n[477] The Greek word for horse is [Greek: hippos].\r\n\r\n[478] Derived from [Greek: pheidesthai], to save.\r\n\r\n[479] The name Phidippides contains both words, [Greek: hippos], horse,\r\nand [Greek: pheidesthai], to save, and was therefore a compromise arrived\r\nat between the two parents.\r\n\r\n[480] The heads of the family of the Alcmaeonidae bore the name of\r\nMegacles from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n[481] A mountain in Attica.\r\n\r\n[482] Aristophanes represents everything belonging to Socrates as being\r\nmean, even down to his dwelling.\r\n\r\n[483] Crates ascribes the same doctrine in one of his plays to the\r\nPythagorean Hippo, of Samos.\r\n\r\n[484] This is pure calumny. Socrates accepted no payment.\r\n\r\n[485] Here the poet confounds Socrates' disciples with the Stoics.\r\nContrary to the text, Socrates held that a man should care for his bodily\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n[486] One of Socrates' pupils.\r\n\r\n[487] Female footwear. They were a sort of light slipper and white in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n[488] He calls off their attention by pretending to show them a\r\ngeometrical problem and seizes the opportunity to steal something for\r\nsupper. The young men who gathered together in the palaestra, or\r\ngymnastic school, were wont there to offer sacrifices to the gods before\r\nbeginning the exercises. The offerings consisted of smaller victims, such\r\nas lambs, fowl, geese, etc., and the flesh afterwards was used for their\r\nmeal (_vide_ Plato in the 'Lysias'). It is known that Socrates taught\r\nwherever he might happen to be, in the palaestra as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[489] The first of the seven sages, born at Miletus.\r\n\r\n[490] Because of their wretched appearance. The Laconians, blockaded in\r\nSphacteria, had suffered sorely from famine.\r\n\r\n[491] In fact, this was one of the chief accusations brought against\r\nSocrates by Miletus and Anytus; he was reproached for probing into the\r\nmysteries of nature.\r\n\r\n[492] When the Athenians captured a town, they divided its lands by lot\r\namong the poorer Athenian citizens.\r\n\r\n[493] An allusion to the Athenian love of law-suits and litigation.\r\n\r\n[494] When originally conquered by Pericles, the island of Euboea, off\r\nthe coasts of Boeotia and Attica, had been treated with extreme\r\nharshness.\r\n\r\n[495] Is about to add, \"you believe in them at all,\" but checks himself.\r\n\r\n[496] This was the doctrine of Anaximenes.\r\n\r\n[497] The scholiast explains that water-cress robs all plants that grow\r\nin its vicinity of their moisture and that they consequently soon wither\r\nand die.\r\n\r\n[498] In the other Greek towns, the smaller coins were of copper.\r\n\r\n[499] Athamas, King of Thebes. An allusion to a tragedy by Sophocles, in\r\nwhich Athamas is dragged before the altar of Zeus with his head circled\r\nwith a chaplet, to be there sacrificed; he is, however, saved by\r\nHeracles.\r\n\r\n[500] No doubt Socrates sprinkled flour over the head of Strepsiades in\r\nthe same manner as was done with the sacrificial victims.\r\n\r\n[501] The mysteries of Eleusis celebrated in the Temple of Demeter.\r\n\r\n[502] A mountain of Attica, north of Athens.\r\n\r\n[503] Sybaris, a town of Magna Graecia (Lucania), destroyed by the\r\nCrotoniates in 709 B.C., was rebuilt by the Athenians under the name of\r\nThurium in 444 B.C. Ten diviners had been sent with the Athenian\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\n[504] A parody of the dithyrambic style.\r\n\r\n[505] Hieronymus, a dithyrambic poet and reputed an infamous pederast.\r\n\r\n[506] When guests at the nuptials of Pirithous, King of the Lapithae, and\r\nHippodamia, they wanted to carry off and violate the bride. That,\r\naccording to legend, was the origin of their war against the Lapithae.\r\nHieronymus is likened to the Centaurs on account of his bestial passion.\r\n\r\n[507] A general, incessantly scoffed at by Aristophanes because of his\r\ncowardice.\r\n\r\n[508] Aristophanes frequently mentions him as an effeminate and debauched\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[509] A celebrated sophist, born at Ceos, and a disciple of Protagoras.\r\nWhen sent on an embassy by his compatriots to Athens, he there publicly\r\npreached on eloquence, and had for his disciples Euripides, Isocrates and\r\neven Socrates. His \"fifty drachmae lecture\" has been much spoken of; that\r\nsum had to be paid to hear it.\r\n\r\n[510] These three men have already been referred to.\r\n\r\n[511] A promontory of Attica (the modern Cape Colonna) about fifty miles\r\nfrom the Piraeus. Here stood a magnificent Temple, dedicated to Athené.\r\n\r\n[512] The opening portion of the parabasis belongs to a second edition of\r\nthe 'Clouds.' Aristophanes had been defeated by Cratinus and Amipsias,\r\nwhose pieces, called the 'Bottle' and 'Connus,' had been crowned in\r\npreference to the 'Clouds,' which, it is said, was not received any\r\nbetter at its second representation.\r\n\r\n[513] Two characters introduced into the 'Daedalians' by Aristophanes in\r\nstrong contrast to each other. Some fragments only of this piece remain\r\nto us.\r\n\r\n[514] It was only at the age of thirty, according to some, of forty,\r\naccording to others, that a man could present a piece in his own name.\r\nThe 'Daedalians' had appeared under the auspices of Cleonides and\r\nChalistrates, whom we find again later as actors in Aristophanes' pieces.\r\n\r\n[515] Allusion to the recognition of Orestes by Electra at her brother's\r\ntomb. (_See_ the 'Choëphorae' of Aeschylus.)\r\n\r\n[516] An image of the penis, drooping in this case, instead of standing,\r\ncarried as a phallic emblem in the Dionysiac processions.\r\n\r\n[517] A licentious dance.\r\n\r\n[518] This coarse way of exciting laughter, says the scholiast, had been\r\nused by Eupolis, the comic writer, a rival of Aristophanes.\r\n\r\n[519] In the 'Knights.'\r\n\r\n[520] Presented in 421 B.C. The 'Clouds' having been played a second time\r\nin 419 B.C., one may conclude that this piece had appeared a third time\r\non the Athenian stage.\r\n\r\n[521] Doubtless a parody of the legend of Andromeda.\r\n\r\n[522] A poet of the older comedy, who had written forty plays. It is said\r\nthat he dared to accuse Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles, of impiety and\r\nthe practice of prostitution.\r\n\r\n[523] Cleon.\r\n\r\n[524] This part of the parabasis belongs to the first edition of the\r\n'Clouds,' since Aristophanes here speaks of Cleon as alive.\r\n\r\n[525] A mountain in Delos, dedicated to Apollo and Diana.\r\n\r\n[526] Artemis.\r\n\r\n[527] An allusion to the reform, which the astronomer Meton had wanted to\r\nintroduce into the calendar. Cleostratus of Tenedos, at the beginning of\r\nthe fifth century, had devised the _octaeteris_, or cycle of eight years,\r\nand this had been generally adopted. This is how this system arrived at\r\nan agreement between the solar and the lunar periods: 8 solar years\r\ncontaining 2922 days, while 8 lunar years only contain 2832 days, there\r\nwas a difference of 90 days, for which Cleostratus compensated by\r\nintercalating 3 months of 30 days each, which were placed after the\r\nthird, fifth and eighth year of the cycle. Hence these years had an extra\r\nmonth each. But in this system, the lunar months had been reckoned as 354\r\ndays, whereas they are really 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes. To rectify\r\nthis minor error Meton invented a cycle of 19 years, which bears his\r\nname. This new system which he tried to introduce naturally caused some\r\ndisturbance in the order of the festivals, and for this or some other\r\nreason his system was not adopted. The octaeteris continued to be used\r\nfor all public purposes, the only correction being, that three extra days\r\nwere added to every second octaeteris.\r\n\r\n[528] Both sons of Zeus.\r\n\r\n[529] Hyperbolus had supported Meton in his desire for reform. Having\r\nbeen sent as the Athenian deputy to the council of the Amphictyons, he\r\nshould, like his colleagues, have returned to Athens with his head\r\nwreathed with laurel. It is said the wind took this from him; the Clouds\r\nboast of the achievement.\r\n\r\n[530] These are poetical measures; Strepsiades thinks measures of\r\ncapacity are meant.\r\n\r\n[531] Containing four _choenixes_.\r\n\r\n[532] So called from its stirring, warlike character; it was composed of\r\ntwo dactyls and a spondee, followed again by two dactyls and a spondee.\r\n\r\n[533] Composed of dactyls and anapaests.\r\n\r\n[534] [Greek: Daktylos] means, of course, both _dactyl_, name of a\r\nmetrical foot, and finger. Strepsiades presents his middle finger, with\r\nthe other fingers and thumb bent under in an indecent gesture meant to\r\nsuggest the penis and testicles. The Romans for this reason called the\r\nmiddle finger 'digitus infamis,' the _unseemly finger_. The Emperor Nero\r\nis said to have offered his hand to courtiers to kiss sometimes in this\r\nindecent way.\r\n\r\n[535] Meaning he was too poor, Aristophanes represents him as a glutton\r\nand a parasite.\r\n\r\n[536] A woman's name.\r\n\r\n[537] He is classed as a woman because of his cowardice and effeminacy.\r\n\r\n[538] In Greek, the vocative of Amynias is Amynia; thus it has a feminine\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n[539] The Corinthians, the allies of Sparta, ravaged Attica. [Greek:\r\nKor], the first portion of the Greek word, is the root of the word which\r\nmeans a bug in the same language.\r\n\r\n[540] Mirrors, or burning glasses, are meant, such as those used by\r\nArchimedes two centuries later at the siege of Syracuse, when he set the\r\nRoman fleet on fire from the walls of the city.\r\n\r\n[541] That is, the family of the Alcmaeonidae; Coesyra was wife of\r\nAlcmaeon.\r\n\r\n[542] Socrates was an Athenian; but the atheist Diagoras, known as 'the\r\nenemy of the gods' hailed from the island of Melos. Strepsiades,\r\ncrediting Socrates with the same incredulity, assigns him the same\r\nbirthplace.\r\n\r\n[543] i.e. the enemies of the gods. An allusion to the giants, the sons\r\nof Earth, who had endeavoured to scale heaven.\r\n\r\n[544] Pericles had squandered all the wealth accumulated in the Acropolis\r\nupon the War. When he handed in his accounts, he refused to explain the\r\nuse of a certain twenty talents and simply said, \"_I spent them on what\r\nwas necessary_.\" Upon hearing of this reply, the Lacedaemonians, who were\r\nalready discontented with their kings, Cleandrides and Plistoanax, whom\r\nthey accused of carrying on the war in Attica with laxness, exiled the\r\nfirst-named and condemned the second to payment of a fine of fifteen\r\ntalents for treachery. In fact, the Spartans were convinced that Pericles\r\nhad kept silent as to what he had done with the twenty talents, because\r\nhe did not want to say openly, \"_I gave this sum to the Kings of\r\nLacedaemon_.\"\r\n\r\n[545] The basket in which Aristophanes shows us Socrates suspended to\r\nbring his mind nearer to the subtle regions of air.\r\n\r\n[546] The scholiast tells us that Just Discourse and Unjust Discourse\r\nwere brought upon the stage in cages, like cocks that are going to fight.\r\nPerhaps they were even dressed up as cocks, or at all events wore cocks'\r\nheads as their masks.\r\n\r\n[547] In the language of the schools of philosophy just reasoning was\r\ncalled 'the stronger'--[Greek: ho kreitt_on logos], unjust reasoning,\r\n'the weaker'--[Greek: ho h_ett_on logos].\r\n\r\n[548] A character in one of the tragedies of Aeschylus, a beggar and a\r\nclever, plausible speaker.\r\n\r\n[549] A sycophant and a quibbler, renowned for his unparalleled bad faith\r\nin the law-suits he was perpetually bringing forward.\r\n\r\n[550] The opening words of two hymns, attributed to Lamprocles, an\r\nancient lyric poet, the son or the pupil of Medon.\r\n\r\n[551] A poet and musician of Mitylené, who gained the prize of the lyre\r\nat the Panathenaea in 457 B.C. He lived at the Court of Hiero, where,\r\nSuidas says, he was at first a slave and the cook. He added two strings\r\nto the lyre, which hitherto had had only seven. He composed effeminate\r\nairs of a style unknown before his day.\r\n\r\n[552] Zeus had a temple in the citadel of Athens under the name of\r\nPolieus or protector of the city; bullocks were sacrificed to him\r\n(Buphonia). In the days of Aristophanes, these feasts had become\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n[553] One of the oldest of the dithyrambic poets.\r\n\r\n[554] Used by the ancient Athenians to keep their hair in place. The\r\ncustom was said to have a threefold significance; by it the Athenians\r\nwanted to show that they were musicians, autochthons (i.e. indigenous to\r\nthe country) and worshippers of Apollo. Indeed, grasshoppers were\r\nconsidered to sing with harmony; they swarmed on Attic soil and were\r\nsacred to Phoebus, the god of music.\r\n\r\n[555] Telesippus, Demophon and Pericles by name; they were a byword at\r\nAthens for their stupidity. Hippocrates was a general.\r\n\r\n[556] The famous gardens of the Academia, just outside the walls of\r\nAthens; they included gymnasia, lecture halls, libraries and picture\r\ngalleries. Near by was a wood of sacred olives.\r\n\r\n[557] Apparently the historian of that name is meant; in any case it\r\ncannot refer to the celebrated epic poet, author of the 'Thebaïs.'\r\n\r\n[558] Among the Greeks, hot springs bore the generic name of 'Baths of\r\nHeracles.' A legend existed that these had gushed forth spontaneously\r\nbeneath the tread of the hero, who would plunge into them and there\r\nregain fresh strength to continue his labours.\r\n\r\n[559] King of Pylos, according to Homer, the wisest of all the Greeks.\r\n\r\n[560] Peleus, son of Aeacus, having resisted the appeals of Astydamia,\r\nthe wife of Acastus, King of Iolchos, was denounced to her husband by her\r\nas having wished to seduce her, so that she might be avenged for his\r\ndisdain. Acastus in his anger took Peleus to hunt with him on Mount\r\nPelion, there deprived him of his weapons and left him a prey to wild\r\nanimals. He was about to die, when Hermes brought him a sword forged by\r\nHephaestus.\r\n\r\n[561] Thetis, to escape the solicitations of Peleus, assumed in turn the\r\nform of a bird, of a tree, and finally of a tigress; but Peleus learnt of\r\nProteus the way of compelling Thetis to yield to his wishes. The gods\r\nwere present at his nuptials and made the pair rich presents.\r\n\r\n[562] According to the scholiast, an adulterer was punished in the\r\nfollowing manner: a radish was forced up his rectum, then every hair was\r\ntorn out round that region, and the portion so treated was then covered\r\nwith burning embers.\r\n\r\n[563] Having said this, Just Discourse threw his cloak into the\r\namphitheatre and took a seat with the spectators.\r\n\r\n[564] Because it never rains there; for all other reasons residence in\r\nEgypt was looked upon as undesirable.\r\n\r\n[565] That is, the last day of the month.\r\n\r\n[566] By Athenian law, if anyone summoned another to appear before the\r\nCourts, he was obliged to deposit a sum sufficient to cover the costs of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n[567] He points to an earthenware sphere, placed at the entrance of\r\nSocrates' dwelling, and which was intended to represent the Whirlwind,\r\nthe deity of the philosophers. This sphere took the place of the column\r\nwhich the Athenians generally dedicated to Apollo, and which stood in the\r\nvestibule of their houses.\r\n\r\n[568] An Athenian poet, who is said to have left one hundred and sixty\r\ntragedies behind him; he only once carried off the prize. Doubtless he\r\nhad introduced gods or demi-gods bewailing themselves into one of his\r\ntragedies.\r\n\r\n[569] This exclamation, \"Oh! Pallas, thou hast undone me!\" and the reply\r\nof Strepsiades are borrowed, says the scholiast, from a tragedy by\r\nXenocles, the son of Carcinus. Alcmena is groaning over the death of her\r\nbrother, Licymnius, who had been killed by Tlepolemus.\r\n\r\n[570] A proverb, applied to foolish people.\r\n\r\n[571] The ram of Phryxus, the golden fleece of which was hung up on a\r\nbeech tree in a field dedicated to Ares in Colchis.\r\n\r\n[572] The subject of Euripides' 'Aeolus.' Since among the Athenians it\r\nwas lawful to marry a half-sister, if not born of the same mother,\r\nStrepsiades mentions here that it was his _uterine_ sister, whom Macareus\r\ndishonoured, thus committing both rape and incest.\r\n\r\n[573] A cleft in the rocks at the back of the Acropolis at Athens, into\r\nwhich criminals were hurled.\r\n\r\n[574] He repeats the words of Socrates at their first interview, in\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAcademia, gardens of\r\nAcharnae, hostages of\r\n--inhabitants of\r\n--township of\r\nAcharnians, date fixed\r\n--date of\r\nAdonis, festivals of\r\nAdultery, punishment of\r\nAegaean, Islands of\r\nAegeus, a mythical king\r\nAeschylus, character from\r\n--plays after death\r\nAesop, Fable of\r\nAetolian, meaning of\r\nAge fixed for playwrights\r\nAgoracritus, crime imputed\r\n--meaning of\r\nAlcibiades, his father\r\nAmorgos silks\r\nAmphitheus, play on word\r\nAmyclae, town near Sparta\r\nAnagyra, town, an obstacle\r\nAnapaests, reference to\r\nAnaximenes, doctrine of\r\nAndromeda, legend parodied\r\nAnthesteria.

Events here described\r\ncover the years 1493-1603, and the history proper of the islands from\r\n1565. Morga's work is important, as being written by a royal official\r\nand a keen observer and participator in affairs. Consequently he\r\ntouches more on the practical everyday affairs of the islands, and in\r\nhis narrative shows forth the policies of the government, its ideals,\r\nand its strengths and weaknesses. His book is written in the true\r\nhistoric spirit, and the various threads of the history of the islands\r\nare followed systematically. As being one of the first of published\r\nbooks regarding the Philippines, it has especial value. Political,\r\nsocial, and economic phases of life, both among the natives and their\r\nconquerors, are treated. The futility of the Spanish policy in making\r\nexternal expeditions, and its consequent neglect of internal affairs;\r\nthe great Chinese question; the growth of trade; communication with\r\nJapan; missionary movements from the islands to surrounding countries;\r\nthe jealous and envious opposition of the Portuguese; the dangers of\r\nsea-voyages: all these are portrayed vividly, yet soberly. Morga's\r\nposition in the state allowed him access to many documents, and he\r\nseems to have been on general good terms with all classes, so that he\r\nreadily gained a knowledge of facts. The character of Morga's work\r\nand his comprehensive treatment of the history, institutions, and\r\nproducts of the Philippines, render possible and desirable the copious\r\nannotations of this and the succeeding volume. These annotations are\r\ncontributed in part by those of Lord Stanley's translation of Morga,\r\nand those of Rizal's reprint, while the Recopilación de leyes de\r\nIndias furnishes a considerable number of laws.\r\n\r\nThe book is preceded by the usual licenses and authorizations, followed\r\nby the author's dedication and introduction. In the latter he declares\r\nhis purpose in writing his book to be that \"the deeds achieved by our\r\nSpaniards in the discovery, conquest, and conversion of the Filipinas\r\nIslands--as well as various fortunes that they have had from time to\r\ntime in the great kingdoms and among the pagan peoples surrounding the\r\nislands\" may be known. The first seven chapters of the book treat of\r\n\"discoveries, conquests, and other events ... until the death of Don\r\nPedro de Acuña.\" The eighth chapter treats of the natives, government,\r\nconversion, and other details.\r\n\r\nIn rapid survey the author passes the line of demarcation of Alexander\r\nVI, and the voyages of Magalhães and Elcano, Loaisa, Villalobos,\r\nand others, down to the expedition of Legazpi. The salient points\r\nof this expedition are briefly outlined, his peaceful reception\r\nby Tupas and the natives, but their later hostility, because the\r\nSpaniards \"seized their provisions,\" their defeat, the Spaniards'\r\nfirst settlement in Sebu, and the despatching of the advice-boat to\r\nNueva España to discover the return passage, and inform the viceroy of\r\nthe success of the expedition. From Sebu the conquest and settlement\r\nis extended to other islands, and the Spanish capital is finally moved\r\nto Manila. Events come rapidly. The conquest proceeds \"by force of\r\narms or by the efforts of the religious who have sown the good seeds\r\nof the gospel.\" Land is allotted to the conquerors, and towns are\r\ngradually founded, and the amount of the natives' tribute is fixed.\r\n\r\nAt Legazpi's death Guido de Lavezaris assumes his responsibilities\r\nby virtue of a royal despatch among Legazpi's papers, and continues\r\nthe latter's plans. The pirate Limahon is defeated after having slain\r\nMartin de Goiti. Trade with China is established \"and as a consequence\r\nhas been growing ever since.\" The two towns of Betis and Lubao\r\nallotted by Lavezaris to himself are taken from him later by order\r\nof his successor, Dr. Francisco de Sande, but are restored to him by\r\nexpress order of the king, together with the office of master-of-camp.\r\n\r\nSucceeding Lavezaris in 1575, Dr. Francisco de Sande continues \"the\r\npacification of the islands .... especially that of the province\r\nof Camarines.\" The town of Nueva Cáceres is founded, and Sande's\r\npartially effective campaign to Borneo, and its offshoot--that of\r\nEstevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Mindanao--undertaken. The \"San\r\nJuanillo\" is despatched to Nueva España, \"but it was lost at sea\r\nand never heard of again.\" Sande is relieved of his governorship\r\nby Gonzalo Ronquillo de Pefialosa, and after his residencia returns\r\n\"to Nueva España as auditor of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nChapter III details the events of Gonzalo Ronquillo de\r\nPefialosa's administration and the interim of government of Diego\r\nRonquillo. Events, with the greater stability constantly given the\r\nislands, follow more quickly. Gonzalo de Peñalosa, by an agreement with\r\nthe king, is to take six hundred colonists--married and single--to\r\nthe islands, in return for which he is to be governor for life. He\r\nestablishes the town of Arevalo in Panay, builds the Chinese Parián,\r\nendeavors, although unsuccessfully, to discover a return passage\r\nto Nueva España, by the South Sea, and despatches \"a ship to Peru\r\nwith merchandise to trade for certain goods which he said that the\r\nFilipinas needed.\" He imposes the two per cent export duty on goods\r\nto Nueva España, and the three per cent duty on Chinese merchandise,\r\nand \"although he was censured for having done this without his\r\nMajesty's orders\" they \"remained in force, and continued to be imposed\r\nthenceforward.\" The first expedition in aid of Tidore is sent for\r\nthe conquest of the island of Ternate, but proves a failure. Cagayan\r\nis first pacified, and the town of Nueva Cáceres founded. Gabriel de\r\nRivera, after an expedition to Borneo, is sent to Spain to consult\r\nthe best interests of the islands. Domingo de Salazar receives his\r\nappointment as bishop, and is accompanied to the islands by Antonio\r\nSedeño and Alonso Sanchez, the first Jesuits in the islands. In 1583\r\nGonzalo de Peñalosa dies, and is succeeded by his kinsman Diego\r\nRonquillo. Shortly after occurs Manila's first disastrous fire,\r\nbut the city is rebuilt, although with difficulty. In consequence of\r\nRivera's trip to Spain, the royal Audiencia of Manila is established\r\nwith Santiago de Vera as its president and governor of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter are related the events of Santiago de Vera's\r\nadministration, and the suppression of the Audiencia. Vera reaches\r\nthe islands in 1584, whence shortly afterwards he despatches another\r\nexpedition to the Malucos which also fails. The pacification continues,\r\nand the islands are freed from a rebellion and insurrection conspired\r\nbetween Manila and Pampanga chiefs. Fortifications are built and an\r\nartillery foundry established under the charge of natives. During\r\nthis term Candish makes his memorable voyage, passing through\r\nsome of the islands. Finally the Audiencia is suppressed, through\r\nthe representations made by Alonso Sanchez, who is sent to Spain\r\nand Rome with authority to act for all classes of society. On his\r\nreturn he brings from Rome \"many relics, bulls, and letters for the\r\nFilipinas.\" Through the influence of the Jesuit, Gomez Perez Dasmariñas\r\nreceives appointment as governor of the islands; and with his salary\r\nincreased to \"ten thousand Castilian ducados\" and with despatches for\r\nthe suppression of the Audiencia, and the establishment of regular\r\nsoldiers, he arrives at Manila in May, 1590.\r\n\r\nChapter V deals with the term of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas and the\r\ninterims of Pedro de Rojas and Luis Perez Dasmariñas. The term of the\r\nnew governor is characterized by his great energy and enthusiasm. The\r\nManila wall and other fortifications, the building of galleys, the\r\nregulation of trade, various pacifications, the rebuilding of Manila,\r\nand the opening of negotiations with Japan, are all a part of his\r\nadministration, and he is the inspirer of them all. The first note\r\nto the future expeditions to, and troubles with, Camboja and Siam is\r\nstruck by an embassy from the first country in charge of Diego Belloso\r\nwith offers of trade and friendship and requests for aid against Siam,\r\nthe latter being at the time deferred. In accordance with his great\r\ndesire to conquer Ternate, the governor fits out a great fleet in\r\n1593, sending the advance vessels to the Pintados in care of his\r\nson. Shortly after, leaving the city in charge of Diego Ronquillo,\r\nalthough with too few troops for defense, Gomez Perez sets out to\r\njoin his son, but is assassinated by his Chinese rowers, who mutiny\r\nand make off with the galley. After his death, the contests for his\r\noffice begin, for the dead governor had assured various people that\r\nthey would be appointed in case of his death. Especially had he done\r\nthis with Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, a wealthy man of the Pintados,\r\nto whom he \"had shown an appointment drawn in his favor.\" In Manila,\r\nPedro de Rojas, lieutenant-assessor, is chosen governor ad interim,\r\nbut after forty days Luis Perez Dasmariñas takes the office by\r\nvirtue of an appointment regularly drawn in his favor. The return\r\nof the troops to Manila proves an efficacious relief from fears of\r\na Chinese invasion. The vessels sent to Nueva España in 1593 fail\r\nto make the voyage because of stormy weather, but the governor's\r\ndeath is learned in Spain by way of India. The troubles between the\r\nbishop and governor culminate somewhat before the latter's death,\r\nin the departure of the former for Spain, as a result of which an\r\narchbishopric with suffragan bishops is established in the islands,\r\nand the Audiencia is reëstablished. The office of lieutenant-assessor\r\nis given more weight and Morga is sent out to fill it in 1595 under\r\nits changed title of lieutenant-governor. In the administration of\r\nLuis Perez Dasmariñas affairs begin actively with Camboja through\r\nthe expedition despatched under Juan Xuarez Gallinato, and Blas Ruiz\r\nde Hernan Gonzalez and Diego Belloso. The governor, completely under\r\nthe influence of the Dominicans, although against the advice of the\r\n\"majority of people in the city\" sends a fleet to Camboja. Gallinato\r\nfails to reach that country until after Blas Ruiz and Belloso have\r\nquarreled with the Chinese there, killed the usurping Cambodian king,\r\nAnacaparan, and thrown the country into confusion. Much to their\r\ndispleasure Gallinato refuses to continue the conquest, chides the\r\nothers harshly, and departs for Manila by way of Cochinchina. At\r\nCochinchina Blas Ruiz and Belloso go to the kingdom of Lao to find\r\nthe legitimate king of Camboja, Prauncar. On their arrival they find\r\nthat he has died, but partly through their efforts and those of\r\ntwo Malays, the king's younger son, who still survives, is placed\r\non the throne. Gallinato experiences difficulty in Cochinchina,\r\nwhere he endeavors to regain the standard and various other articles\r\nfrom the galley of Gomez Perez that had been stolen by the Chinese,\r\nbut finally returns safely to Manila. Meanwhile Estevan Rodriguez de\r\nFigueroa agrees to subdue Mindanao at his own expense, in return for\r\nwhich he is to have its governorship for two generations. In pursuance\r\nof this he fits out a large expedition, but shortly after reaching\r\nthe island is killed in a fight and ambush, whereupon his first\r\ncommanding officer Juan de la Xara schemes to continue the expedition,\r\nand establishes his men in a settlement near Tampacan, called Murcia.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Governor Francisco Tello forms the subject-matter\r\nof chapter VI. At his arrival in 1596, news is received in the island\r\nof the appointment of Fray Ignacio de Santibañez as archbishop,\r\nand of two appointments for bishops. News of the death of Estevan\r\nRodriguez is brought to Manila, and the machinations of Juan de la\r\nXara to carry on the expedition independently of Manila learned. His\r\ndeath shortly after arrest, while on his way to Oton to push his suit\r\nwith Rodriguez's widow, frustrates his plans. Juan Ronquillo is sent\r\nto Mindanao and takes over the command there, but being discouraged\r\nby the outlook advises an evacuation of the river of Mindanao and the\r\nfortifying of La Caldera, on the Mindanao coast. However he gains a\r\ncomplete victory over the combined forces of Mindanaos and Ternatans,\r\nwhich causes him to send another despatch to Tello. But the latter's\r\nreply to the first despatch having been received, in accordance with\r\nits orders he burns his fort, and after establishing a garrison at\r\nLa Caldera, returns to Manila with the rest of his command. There\r\nhe is arrested for not awaiting Tello's second despatch, but is\r\nliberated on producing a letter ordering him in any event to return\r\nto Manila. Gallinato, on his return from Cochinchina is accused by\r\nhis own men of not following up the victory at Camboja, for had\r\nhe done so, \"all that had been hoped in that kingdom would have\r\nbeen attained.\" An incipient rebellion in Cagayan is checked by the\r\nmurder of its leader by his own countrymen \"who had offered to do it\r\nfor a reward.\" In the year 1596, the remnants of Alvaro de Mendaña\r\nde Neira's expedition that had set out from Peru to rediscover the\r\nSolomon Islands reaches the Philippines after great sufferings from\r\nfamine and disease, and after the death of many men, among them the\r\ncommander himself. The voyage is related in detail in a letter from\r\nthe chief pilot, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros to Morga; it is full of\r\nstirring adventure, and of keen and appreciative observation. One of\r\nthe vessels, the \"San Geronymo\" despatched to Nueva España in 1596,\r\nis forced to put in at a Japanese port because of storms. There they\r\nreceive ill-treatment, and the efforts of the Franciscan missionaries\r\nin Japan in their behalf lead to the edict sentencing them to death,\r\nin accordance with which six Franciscans, three Jesuits, and seventeen\r\nnative helpers are crucified in 1597. Taicosama's wrath, intensified by\r\nthe accusation that the Spaniards conquered kingdoms \"by first sending\r\ntheir religious to the kingdom\" and by entering afterward \"with their\r\narms,\" is satisfied by the crucifixion of the religious and their\r\nassistants, and the men of the \"San Geronymo\" are allowed to return to\r\nManila. The religious write a letter of farewell to Dr. Morga, in which\r\nthey inform him that Japan intends to attack the Philippines. Luis\r\nNavarrete Fajardo is sent to Japan to demand satisfaction, but\r\naccomplishes little. Faranda Quiemon, one of Taicosama's vassals,\r\na man of obscure birth, obtaining permission to make an expedition of\r\nconquest, sets about his preparations, but owing to lack of resources\r\nand initiative fails to complete them. Meanwhile great caution is\r\nexercised in Manila, and the Japanese residing there are sent back\r\nto Japan, while those coming on trading vessels are well treated but\r\ngotten rid of as soon as possible. Cambodian affairs are again set on\r\nfoot, although against the advice of some, through the instrumentality\r\nof Father Alonso Ximenez, a Dominican who had accompanied Gallinato\r\non the former expedition, but who had been left behind at Cochinchina\r\nthrough his own disobedience of orders. Affairs in Mindanao and Jolo\r\nassume a threatening aspect. One Juan Pacho, commander of La Caldera,\r\nis killed in an incursion into Jolo with twenty of his men, and a new\r\ncommander of La Caldera is appointed until a punitive expedition can be\r\nundertaken. In 1598 the archbishop arrives, and the Manila Audiencia\r\nis reëstablished by royal order, and the seal received with great\r\npomp and ceremony. A letter received that same year by Morga from\r\nBlas Ruiz details events in Camboja since he and Belloso went there\r\nwith Gallinato's expedition. Blas Ruiz seeks to excuse their actions\r\nin Camboja and holds out the hope of Spanish conquest and influence\r\non the mainland, and asks help from the islands. As a consequence\r\nof this letter, Luis Perez Dasmariñas secures permission to attempt\r\nan expedition to the mainland at his own expense to aid the king of\r\nCamboja and then to seize the kingdom of Champan, whose king was a\r\nconstant menace to all navigators throughout that region. Negotiations\r\nwith China and the granting of an open port to Spaniards called El\r\nPinal, are opened and secured through the efforts of Juan de Zamudio\r\nwho is sent to China for saltpeter and metals, although with great and\r\nvindictive opposition from the Portuguese, who fear the loss of their\r\nown trade at Macao. At El Pinal the survivors of two of Luis Perez's\r\nthree ships meet with Juan de Zamudio, after suffering great storms,\r\nhardships, and wrecks. The same favor is extended him by the Chinese\r\nas to Zamudio, but the Portuguese show their hostility to him also,\r\nimprisoning the men sent by him to Macao to ask for help, and even\r\nattempting force against him. Both Zamudio and a messenger from Luis\r\nPerez carry news of the latter's disaster to Manila, whereupon a ship\r\nand supplies are sent him with orders to return to Manila. Hernando\r\nde los Rios Coronel, sent to Canton by Luis Perez to negotiate with\r\nthe Chinese, writes from that city to Dr. Morga concerning China and\r\nthe possibility, desirability, and advantages of the Chinese trade in\r\nChina instead of Manila, and the opposition of the Portuguese. China\r\nhe describes as a country \"full of rivers and towns, and without\r\na palmo of ground left lying idle.\" Meanwhile the third vessel of\r\nLuis Perez's fleet, commanded by Luis Ortiz, reaches Camboja, where\r\nhe and his companions join the Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese\r\nalready there. This small force, which is eyed askance by the Malay\r\nleaders and others envious of, and hostile to them on account of their\r\nprowess and their influence with the weak king, is further increased\r\nby Captain Juan de Mendoza Gamboa and Fray Juan Maldonado, a learned\r\nDominican, and their men. The former, having obtained permission to\r\ngo on a trading expedition to Siam, for which he is given letters of\r\nembassy, is also entrusted to convey certain supplies to Don Luis\r\nat Camboja, where he fails to find him. Maldonado is sent by his\r\norder as a companion to Don Luis. This addition to their forces is\r\nwelcomed by the Spaniards in Camboja, and they refuse to let them\r\ndepart until hearing definite news of Luis Perez. The arrival of\r\na contingent of Japanese, mestizos, and one Spaniard, who had left\r\nJapan on a piratical expedition, still further increases the force\r\nin Camboja. The leaders Blas Ruiz, Belloso, and Maldonado treat\r\nwith the king on their own account, but not so satisfactorily as\r\nthey wish. Conflicts and quarrels arising between their forces and\r\nthe Malays, the latter finally overpower and kill the Spaniards,\r\nPortuguese, and Japanese, except several who remain in the country\r\nand Mendoza, Maldonado and a few men who escape in the former's\r\nvessel. In Camboja confusion and anarchy again reign and the king is\r\nbullied and finally killed by the Malays. The Joloans and Mindanaos\r\nare emboldened by the final abandonment and dismantling of the fort\r\nat La Caldera--which is decided upon by the governor against the\r\nopinion of the Audiencia--and, joined in self-defense by the peaceful\r\nnatives of Mindanao, make an incursion against Spaniards and natives\r\nin the Pintados in 1599, in which they take immense booty and many\r\ncaptives. The next year they return with a larger force, but are\r\ndefeated by the alcalde-mayor of Arevalo, whereupon they resolve to\r\nbe revenged. In Japan the death of Taicosama encourages Geronimo de\r\nJesus, a Franciscan who has escaped crucifixion, to open negotiations\r\nwith his successor Daifusama. The latter, desiring trade for his\r\nown northern province of Quanto, requests the governor of Manila,\r\nthrough the religious, for commerce, and men to build ships for the\r\nNueva España trade which he wishes to open. He does not negotiate\r\nconcerning religion, for \"the profit and benefit to be derived from\r\nfriendship and commerce with the Spaniards was more to the taste of\r\nDaifusama than what he had heard concerning their religion.\" However,\r\nthe religious writes that freedom is given to evangelize throughout\r\nJapan, although the only concession given is that the religious could\r\nestablish a house at their trading station. In October of 1600 news\r\nreaches Manila of the coming and depredations of Oliver van Noordt's\r\ntwo vessels. The description of the preparations, made by Morga,\r\nthe instructions given him by the governor, his instructions to\r\nJuan de Alcega, and the fight and its consequences follow. In the\r\nsame year of 1600 the vessels \"Santa Margarita\" and \"San Geronymo\"\r\nare both unable to reach Nueva España, and are wrecked--the latter\r\nnear Catanduanes, and the former in the Ladrones, where it is\r\nrifled by the natives and the men surviving distributed through\r\nthe different villages. In 1600 the \"Santo Tomas\" on its way to the\r\nislands puts in at the Ladrones, but the commander, fearing storms,\r\nrefuses to wait for the Spanish prisoners of the \"Santa Margarita,\"\r\nalthough petitioned to do so by the religious and others. Accordingly\r\na Franciscan, Juan Pobre, full of pity for the unfortunate men, casts\r\nin his lot with them and voluntarily remains behind. The \"San Felipe\"\r\nis wrecked eighty leguas from Manila, and its cargo taken overland to\r\nthat city. Mindanao and Jolo affairs are meanwhile given into command\r\nof Gallinato, and although he is partially successful, the rains,\r\nhunger, and disease work for the natives, and finally in May of 1602,\r\nGallinato sends to Manila for instructions. Juan de Mendoza and Fray\r\nJuan Maldonado, after leaving Camboja proceed on their journey to\r\nSiam, but are received there coldly by the king, and their trading\r\nis unsatisfactory. Fearing violence they depart one night without\r\nnotifying the Siamese, taking with them certain Portuguese held in\r\nSiam as partial prisoners, but are pursued by the Siamese who molest\r\nthem until in the open sea. From wounds received during the week's\r\ncontinual conflict both Mendoza and Maldonado die, the latter first\r\nwriting to his Order and advising them \"on their consciences not to\r\nagain become instruments of a return to Camboja.\" Troubles in Maluco\r\nbetween the Dutch and natives on the one side and the Portuguese and\r\nSpanish on the other, render it necessary to send aid several times\r\nfrom Manila. In March of 1601, a letter is written by the king of\r\nTidore to Morga requesting aid against Ternate and the Dutch, in\r\nresponse to which supplies and reënforcements are sent in 1602.\r\n\r\nThe seventh chapter deals with events during the period of Pedro de\r\nAcuña's administration. With his arrival in May of 1602, new life and\r\nenergy are infused in public affairs. The new governor first concerns\r\nhimself with home affairs. He constructs galleys but has to postpone\r\nan intended visit to Pintados, in order to attend to Japan and Jolo,\r\nand despatch the vessels to Nueva España. It is determined to open\r\ncommerce with Quanto, but to defer the matter of sending workmen to\r\nJapan to show the Japanese how to construct ships, as that will be\r\ndetrimental. Religious of the various orders go to Japan, but are\r\nreceived less warmly than Geronymo de Jesus's letter leads them to\r\nexpect. The latter pressed by Daifusama for the performance of his\r\npromises finally asks permission to go to Manila to advocate them\r\nin person, whence he brings back assurance of trade with Quanto. The\r\nvessel despatched there is forced to put in at another port, but is\r\nallowed to trade there and to return. Two vessels despatched to Nueva\r\nEspaña in 1602 are forced to return, putting in on the way--the first\r\nat the Ladrones and the other at Japan. The first brings back most of\r\nthe men wrecked at the Ladrones. The second after rough treatment in\r\nJapan finally escapes. As a result of an embassy sent to Daifusama from\r\nthis vessel chapas or writs of safety are provided to the Spaniards so\r\nthat any vessel putting into Japanese ports will be well treated in\r\nthe future. The reënforcements sent to Gallinato at Jolo serve only\r\nto enable him to break camp and return to Manila. While Acuña is on\r\nhis way to Pintados to inspect those islands, a raiding expedition of\r\nMoros goes as far as Luzon and Mindoro, committing many depredations,\r\nthus compelling the governor to return, who narrowly escapes capture. A\r\npunitive expedition of Spaniards and Indians sent in pursuit of the\r\nMoros inflicts but slight damage. Shortly before this a fleet prepared\r\nat Goa for the chastisement of the Malucos sets out under Andrea\r\nFurtado de Mendoza, but is separated by storms. Some of the vessels\r\nwith the commander reach Amboina, but in so crippled and destitute\r\na condition that they are forced to ask help from Manila. Acuña,\r\nalthough arranging independently for an expedition to Maluco, sends\r\na force there under Gallinato in 1603 to aid the Portuguese. Early\r\nin that year the prelude to the Chinese troubles of that same year\r\nis given by the coming of the Chinese mandarins to see the island of\r\ngold, which causes many, among them the archbishop and some religious,\r\nto counsel watchfulness. In 1603 occurs the second disastrous fire\r\nin Manila, with a loss of over one million pesos.\r\n\r\nThe victorious Malays in Camboja are finally driven out by a\r\ncombination of patriotic mandarins, and make the brother of their old\r\nking sovereign, whereupon relations between Camboja and the Philippines\r\nare again established by sending there a number of religious. In May\r\nof 1603 two ships with reënforcements arrive at Manila, bringing\r\ncertain ecclesiastical news. The aid rendered Furtado de Mendoza\r\nby Gallinato does not prove sufficient to subdue the Ternatans, and\r\nGallinato returns to Manila. The present installment of Morga ends\r\nwith the courteous letter written to Acuña by Furtado de Mendoza,\r\nin which he renders praise to Gallinato and his men. The remainder\r\nof the book will appear in the succeeding volume.\r\n\r\nThe present volume ends with two appendices: the first an abstract\r\nof Thomas Candish's circumnavigation; the second an abstract of Dutch\r\nexpeditions to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nTHE EDITORS\r\n\r\nMay, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCESOS DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Antonio de Morga.

In my judgment it is entertaining, profitable,\r\nand worthy of publication. The author has strictly obeyed the laws of\r\nhistory therein, in the excellent arrangement of his work, in which\r\nhe shows his soundness of intellect and a concise style to which\r\nfew attain, together with a true exposition of the subject matter,\r\nas it was written by one who was so fully conversant with it, during\r\nthe years that he governed those islands. I have accordingly affixed\r\nmy signature to this instrument here at the professed house of the\r\nSociety of Jesus in Mexico, on the first of April, 1609.\r\n\r\nJUAN SANCHEZ\r\n\r\nDon Luys de Velasco, knight of the Order of Sanctiago,\r\nviceroy-lieutenant of the king our sovereign, governor and\r\ncaptain-general of Nueva España, and president of the royal Audiencia\r\nand Chancillería established therein, etc. Whereas Doctor Antonio de\r\nMorga, alcalde of criminal causes in this royal Audiencia, informed me\r\nthat he had written a book and treatise on the Events in the Filipinas\r\nIslands, from their earliest discoveries and conquest until the end\r\nof the past year six hundred and seven, and requested me to grant him\r\npermission and privilege to have it printed, to the exclusion of all\r\nothers doing the same for a certain period; and whereas I entrusted\r\nFather Juan Sanchez, of the Society of Jesus, with the inspection\r\nof the said book, as my proxy: therefore, I hereby grant permission\r\nto the said Doctor Antonio de Morga, so that, for the period of the\r\nnext ten years, he, or his appointee, may freely have the said book\r\nprinted by whatever printer he pleases; and I forbid any other person\r\nto do the same within the said time and without the said permission,\r\nunder penalty of losing--and he shall lose--the type and accessories\r\nwith which the said impression shall be made, and the same shall be\r\napplied in equal shares to his Majesty's exchequer and to the said\r\nDoctor Antonio de Morga. Given in Mexico, on the seventh of the month\r\nof April, one thousand six hundred and nine.\r\n\r\nDON LUYS DE VELASCO\r\n\r\nBy order of the viceroy:\r\n\r\nMARTIN LOPEZ GAUNA\r\n\r\nDon Fray Garcia Guerra, by the divine grace and that of the holy\r\napostolic see, archbishop of Mexico, member of his Majesty's Council,\r\netc. Having seen the opinion expressed by Father Juan Sanchez, of the\r\nSociety of Jesus, after he had examined the book presented to us by\r\nDoctor Antonio de Morga, alcalde in this court and Chancillería,\r\nentitled Events in the Filipinas Islands, their Conquest and\r\nConversion, for which we granted him authority; and since it is\r\nevident, by the above-mentioned opinion, that it contains nothing\r\nagainst our holy Catholic faith, or good morals, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, it is useful and profitable to all persons who may read it:\r\ntherefore we do hereby grant permission to the said Doctor Antonio de\r\nMorga, to have the said book of the said conquest and conversion of\r\nthe Filipinas Islands printed in any of the printing establishments\r\nof the city. Given in Mexico, on the seventh of April, one thousand\r\nsix hundred and nine.\r\n\r\nFRAY GARCIA, archbishop of Mexico.\r\n\r\nBy order of his most illustrious Lordship, the archbishop of Mexico:\r\n\r\nDON JUAN DE PORTILLA, secretary.\r\n\r\n¶To Don Cristoval Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas, duke of Cea [1]\r\n\r\nI offer your Excellency this small work, worthy of a kind reception as\r\nmuch for its faithful relation as for its freedom from artifice and\r\nadornment. Knowing my poor resources, I began it with fear; but what\r\nencouraged me to proceed was the fact that, if what is given were\r\nto bear an equal proportion to the receiver, there would be no one\r\nworthy of placing his works in your Excellency's hands; and oblivion\r\nwould await the deeds achieved in these times by our Spaniards in\r\nthe discovery, conquest, and conversion of the Filipinas Islands--as\r\nwell as various fortunes which they have had from time to time in the\r\ngreat kingdoms and among the pagan peoples surrounding the islands:\r\nfor, on account of the remoteness of those regions, no account has\r\nbeen given to the public which purports to treat of them from their\r\nbeginnings down to the present condition. I entreat your Excellency to\r\naccept my good will, which is laid prostrate at your feet; and should\r\nthis short treatise not afford that pleasure, which self-love--that\r\ninfirmity of the human mind--leads me to expect, will your Excellency\r\ndeal with me, as you are wont to deal with all, and read this book\r\nand conceal its imperfections with the exercise of your toleration\r\nand gentleness. For you are so richly endowed with these and other\r\nvirtues--which, through the divine power, cause lofty things not to\r\nkeep aloof from humble ones; and which, in addition to your own natural\r\ngreatness, have placed your Excellency in your present office for the\r\ngood of these realms, where you reward and favor the good, and correct\r\nand check the opposite. In such rule consists the welfare of the state;\r\nand this made the ancient philosopher, Democritus, say that reward and\r\npunishment were true gods. In order to enjoy this happiness, we need\r\nnot crave any bygone time, but, contenting ourselves with the present,\r\npray that God may preserve your Excellency to us for many years.\r\n\r\nDON ANTONIO DE MORGA [2]\r\n\r\nTo the reader [3]\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the monarchy of the Spanish kings is due to the zeal\r\nand care with which they have defended, within their own hereditary\r\nkingdoms, the holy Catholic faith taught by the Roman church, against\r\nall enemies who oppose it, or seek by various errors to obscure its\r\ntruth which the kings have disseminated throughout the world. Thus,\r\nby the mercy of God, they preserve their kingdoms and subjects in\r\nthe purity of the Christian religion, meriting thereby their glorious\r\ntitle and renown of \"Defenders of the Faith.\" Moreover, by the valor\r\nof their indomitable hearts, and at the expense of their revenues and\r\npossessions, they have ploughed the seas with Spanish fleets and men,\r\nand discovered and conquered vast kingdoms in the most remote and\r\nunknown parts of the world. They have led the inhabitants of these\r\nregions to a knowledge of the true God, and into the fold of the\r\nChristian church, in which those peoples now live, governed in civil\r\nand political matters with peace and justice, under the shelter and\r\nprotection of the royal arm and power, which were wanting to them\r\nwhen weighed down by blind tyrannies and barbarous cruelties, on\r\nwhich the enemy of the human race had so long reared them for himself.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the crown and scepter of España have extended\r\nthemselves wherever the sun sheds its light, from its rising to its\r\nsetting, with the glory and splendor of their power and majesty, and\r\nthe Spanish monarchs have excelled the other princes of the earth by\r\nhaving gained innumerable souls for heaven, which has been España's\r\nprincipal intention and its wealth. These, together with the great\r\nriches and treasures which España enjoys, and the famous deeds and\r\nvictories which it has won, cause the whole world to magnify and\r\nextol its lofty name and the energy and valor of its subjects, who\r\nin accomplishing these deeds have lavished their blood.\r\n\r\nHaving won America, the fourth part of the earth, of which the\r\nancients knew naught, they sailed in the course of the sun until\r\nthey discovered an archipelago of many islands in the eastern\r\nocean, adjacent to farther Asia, inhabited by various peoples,\r\nand abounding in rich metals, precious stones, and pearls, and all\r\nmanner of fruit. There raising the standard of the Faith, they freed\r\nthose peoples from the yoke and power of the demon, and placed them\r\nunder the command and government of the Faith. Consequently they may\r\njustly raise in those islands the pillars and trophies of Non plus\r\nultra which the famous Hercules left on the shore of the Cadiz Sea,\r\nwhich were afterward cast down by the strong arm of Cárlos V, [4]\r\nour sovereign, who surpassed Hercules in great deeds and enterprises.\r\n\r\nAfter the islands had been conquered by the sovereign light of the\r\nholy gospel which entered therein, the heathen were baptized, the\r\ndarkness of their paganism was banished, and they changed their own for\r\nChristian names. The islands also, losing their former name, took--with\r\nthe change of religion and the baptism of their inhabitants--that\r\nof Filipinas Islands, in recognition of the great favors received\r\nat the hands of his Majesty Filipo the Second, our sovereign, in\r\nwhose fortunate time and reign they were conquered, protected, and\r\nencouraged, as a work and achievement of his royal hands.\r\n\r\nTheir discovery, conquest, and conversion were not accomplished without\r\ngreat expenditure, labor, and Spanish blood, with varying success,\r\nand amid dangers: these things render the work more illustrious,\r\nand furnish a spacious field of which historians may treat, for such\r\nis their office. Certainly the subject matter is not scanty, and\r\ncontains both serious and pleasant elements sufficient to be worthy\r\nof attention, so that it will not depreciate historians to treat of\r\nIndian occurrences and wars, which those who have not experienced\r\nundervalue. For the people of those regions are valiant and warlike\r\nnations of Asia, who have been reared in continual warfare, both by\r\nsea and by land, and who use artillery and other warlike implements,\r\nwhich the necessity of defending themselves against great and powerful\r\nneighboring kingdoms, taught them to use skilfully; and--although\r\nsomewhat imperfectly--they have gained dexterity and have completed\r\ntheir education in the school of España, which recently brought war to\r\ntheir gates--thus sharing the experience of other provinces of Europe,\r\nwho also had formerly been ignorant and careless of the use of arms.\r\n\r\nSome painstaking persons, to whom--for lack of time and means--I have\r\ngiven and delivered many papers and relations which I possessed, have\r\nplanned to write this history; and I hope that they will publish it\r\nin better shape than the fragmentary histories which we have hitherto\r\nreceived from some contemporary historians. [5]\r\n\r\nI spent eight years in the Filipinas Islands, the best years of\r\nmy life, serving continuously as lieutenant of the governor and\r\ncaptain-general, and, as soon as the royal Audiencia of Manila was\r\nestablished, in the office of auditor, which I was the first to\r\nfill. [6] And desirous that the affairs of those islands should be\r\nknown, especially those which occurred during my connection with\r\nthem, I have related these matters in a book of eight chapters,\r\ntracing them from their origin so far as was necessary. The first\r\nseven chapters contain an account of the discoveries, conquests, and\r\nother events in the islands and neighboring kingdoms and provinces,\r\nwhich occurred during the time of the proprietary governors [7]\r\nuntil the death of Don Pedro de Acuña. The eighth and last chapter\r\ncontains a brief summary and account of the nature of these regions,\r\ntheir inhabitants, the manner of governing and converting them, and\r\nother details; moreover, it treats of the acquaintance, dealings,\r\nand intercourse which they maintain with their neighboring islands and\r\npagan communities. As fearful am I for the imperfections which will be\r\nfound in this work, as I am persuaded that they deserve forgiveness,\r\nsince my design and chief intent has been to give each one his due and\r\nto present the truth without hatred or flattery, which has been injured\r\nin some current narratives. [8] The latter is a fault to be severely\r\nreproved in those who relate the deeds of others, inasmuch as it was\r\nprohibited by a penal law which Cato and Marcius, tribunes of the\r\nRoman people, established for those who, in relating their own deeds,\r\noverstepped the truth--although this seemed less worthy of punishment,\r\non account of the self-love which intervenes in such a case.\r\n\r\nThere will not be wanting some person who will point out my oversights,\r\nbut I shall have already answered him by confessing them; and should\r\nthis not suffice to silence him, I shall stop up my ears like another\r\nUlysses, and--considering the haste with which I have written--endure\r\nthis inconvenience and difficulty, desiring only to please and serve\r\nwhomsoever may read it; and this will be sufficient to protect me\r\nfrom greater dangers.\r\n\r\nNotice is given that\r\n\r\nIn reading this history, one may find certain words--names of\r\nprovinces, towns, magistrates, arms, and vessels--which it has seemed\r\nmore suitable to write by their usual names in those regions. In\r\nthe last chapter, which contains an account of the islands and their\r\npeculiarities, these words will be explained and defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Of the first discoveries of the eastern islands; the voyage thither\r\nby Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi; the conquest and pacification of\r\nthe Filipinas during his governorship, and that of Guido de Labazarris,\r\nwho afterward held the office.\r\n\r\n¶ CHAPTER FIRST\r\n\r\nAccording to ancient and modern cosmographers, that part of the world\r\ncalled Asia has adjacent to it a multitude of greater and lesser\r\nislands, inhabited by various nations and peoples, and as rich in\r\nprecious stones, gold, silver, and other minerals, as they abound in\r\nfruit and grain, flocks, and animals. Some of the islands yield all\r\nkinds of spices which are carried away and distributed throughout\r\nthe world. These islands are commonly designated in their books,\r\ndescriptions, and sea-charts, as the great archipelago of San Lazaro,\r\nand are located in the eastern ocean. Among the most famous of them\r\nare the islands of Maluco, Céleves, Tendaya, Luzon, Mindanao, and\r\nBorneo, which are now called the Filipinas.\r\n\r\nWhen Pope Alexander the Sixth divided the conquests of the new world\r\nbetween the kings of Castilla and of Portugal, the kings agreed to\r\nmake the division by means of a line drawn across the world by the\r\ncosmographers, so that they might continue their discoveries and\r\nconquests, one toward the west and the other toward the east, and\r\npacify whatever regions each might gain within his own demarcation.\r\n\r\nAfter the crown of Portugal had conquered the city of Malaca, on\r\nthe mainland of Asia, in the kingdom of Jor [Johore]--called by\r\nthe ancients Aurea Chersonesus--a Portuguese fleet, in the year one\r\nthousand five hundred and eleven, on hearing of neighboring islands\r\nand especially of those of Maluco and Banda, where cloves and nutmegs\r\nare gathered, went to discover them. After touching at Banda, they\r\nwent to Terrenate, one of the islands of Maluco, at the invitation\r\nof its king, to defend him against his neighbor, the king of Tidore,\r\nwith whom he was at war. This was the beginning of the Portuguese\r\nsettlement in Maluco.\r\n\r\nFrancisco Serrano, who after this discovery returned to Malaca, and\r\nthence went to India with the purpose of going to Portugal to give\r\nan account of the discovery, died before he had accomplished this\r\nvoyage, but not, however, without having communicated in letters to\r\nhis friend, Fernando de Magallanes, what he had seen; [9] for they\r\nhad been together at the taking of Malaca, although the latter was\r\nthen in Portugal. From this relation, Magallanes learned whatever\r\nwas necessary for the discovery and navigation of these islands. [10]\r\n\r\nAt this time, Magallanes, who for certain reasons had entered the\r\nservice of the king of Castilla, told the emperor Cárlos V, our\r\nsovereign, that the islands of Maluco fell within the demarcation of\r\nthe latter's crown of Castilla, and that their conquest belonged to\r\nhim, according to the concessions made by Pope Alexander; moreover,\r\nhe offered to make the expedition and navigation to the islands in\r\nthe emperor's name, by sailing through that part of the demarcation\r\nbelonging to Castilla, and by availing himself of a famous astrologer\r\nand cosmographer, named Ruyfarelo [sic], whom he had with him.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, moved by the importance of the undertaking, entrusted\r\nFernando de Magallanes with this expedition and discovery, supplying\r\nhim with the necessary ships and provisions therefor. Thus equipped, he\r\nset sail and discovered the strait to which he gave his name. Through\r\nthis he entered the southern sea, and sailed to the islands of Tendaya\r\nand Sebu, where he was killed by the natives of Matan, which is one of\r\nthese islands. His ships proceeded to Maluco, where the sailors fell\r\ninto disputes and contentions with the Portuguese then stationed in the\r\nisland of Terrenate. Finally, not being able to maintain themselves\r\nthere, the Castilians left Maluco in a ship, called the \"Victoria,\"\r\nthe only remaining vessel of their fleet. As leader and captain,\r\nthey chose Juan Sebastian del Caño, who made the voyage to Castilla\r\nby way of India, where he arrived with but few men, and informed his\r\nMajesty of the discovery of the great archipelago, and of his voyage.\r\n\r\nThe same enterprise was attempted at other times, and was carried\r\nout by Juan Sebastian del Caño, Comendador Loaisa, the Saoneses,\r\nand the bishop of Plasencia. [11] But these did not bear the fruits\r\nexpected, on account of the hardships and perils of so long a voyage,\r\nand the opposition received by those who reached Maluco, from the\r\nPortuguese there.\r\n\r\nAfter all these events, as it was thought that this discovery might\r\nbe made quicker and better by way of Nueva España, in the year one\r\nthousand five hundred and forty-five, [12] a fleet, under command of\r\nRui Lopez de Villalobos, was sent by that route. They reached Maluco\r\nby way of Sebu, where they quarreled with the Portuguese, and suffered\r\nmisfortunes and hardships, so that they were unable to effect the\r\ndesired end; nor could the fleet return to Nueva España whence it\r\nhad sailed, but was destroyed. Some of the surviving Castilians left\r\nMaluco by way of Portuguese India and returned to Castilla. There they\r\nrelated the occurrences of their voyage, and the quality and nature\r\nof the islands of Maluco and of the other islands that they had seen.\r\n\r\nAfterward as King Don Felipe II, our sovereign, considered it\r\ninadvisable for him to desist from that same enterprise, and being\r\ninformed by Don Luys de Velasco, viceroy of Nueva España, and by Fray\r\nAndres de Urdaneta of the Augustinian order--who had been in Maluco\r\nwith the fleet of Comendador Loaisa, while a layman--that this voyage\r\nmight be made better and quicker by way of Nueva Españia, he entrusted\r\nthe expedition to the viceroy. Fray Andres de Urdaneta left the court\r\nfor Nueva Españia, [13] for, as he was so experienced and excellent\r\na cosmographer, he offered to go with the fleet and to discover the\r\nreturn voyage. The viceroy equipped a fleet and its crew with the\r\nmost necessary things in Puerto de la Navidad, in the southern sea,\r\nunder charge of a worthy and reliable man, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi,\r\na citizen of Mexico and a native of the province of Guipuzcoa. On\r\naccount of the viceroy's death, the Audiencia which was governing in\r\nhis place completed arrangements for the despatching of Legazpi, and\r\ngave him instructions as to his destination, with orders not to open\r\nthem until three hundred leguas at sea; for there were differences\r\namong members of the fleet, some saying that they would better go\r\nto Nueva Guinea, others to the Luzones, and others to Maluco. Miguel\r\nLopez de Legazpi left Puerto de la Navidad in the year one thousand\r\nfive hundred and sixty-four, with five ships and five hundred men,\r\naccompanied by Fray Andres de Urdaneta and four other religious of\r\nthe Order of St. Augustine. After sailing westward for several days,\r\nhe opened his instructions, and found that he was ordered to go to\r\nthe islands of Luzones and there endeavor to pacify them and reduce\r\nthem to the obedience of his Majesty, and to make them accept the\r\nholy Catholic faith. [14] He continued his voyage until reaching the\r\nisland of Sebu, where he anchored, induced by the convenience of a\r\ngood port and by the nature of the land. At first he was received\r\npeacefully by the natives and by their chief Tupas; but later they\r\ntried to kill him and his companions, for the Spaniards having seized\r\ntheir provisions, the natives took up arms against the latter; but the\r\nopposite to their expectations occurred, for the Spaniards conquered\r\nand subdued them. Seeing what had happened in Sebu, the natives of\r\nother neighboring islands came peacefully before the adelantado,\r\nrendered him homage, and supplied his camp with a few provisions. The\r\nfirst of the Spanish settlements was made in that port, and was called\r\nthe city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus [Most holy name of Jesus],\r\n[15] because a carved image of Jesus had been found in one of the\r\nhouses of the natives when the Spaniards conquered the latter, which\r\nwas believed to have been left there by the fleet of Magallanes. The\r\nnatives held the image in great reverence, and it wrought miracles\r\nfor them in times of need. The Spaniards placed it in the monastery\r\nof St. Augustine, in that city.\r\n\r\nThat same year the adelantado despatched the flagship of his fleet\r\nto Nueva España, with the relation and news of what had happened\r\nduring the voyage, and of the settlement in Sebu. He requested men\r\nand supplies in order to continue the pacification of the other\r\nislands. Fray Andres de Urdaneta and his associate, Fray Andres de\r\nAguirre, sailed in the vessel.\r\n\r\nOne of the ships which left Puerto de la Navidad in company with the\r\nfleet and under command of Don Alonso de Arellano, carried as pilot\r\none Lope Martin, a mulatto and a good sailor, although a turbulent\r\nfellow. When the ship neared the islands, it left the fleet and\r\nwent among them ahead of the other vessels. There they bartered\r\nfor provisions, and, without awaiting the adelantado, returned to\r\nNueva España by a northerly course--either because of their slight\r\ngratification at having made the voyage to the islands, or to gain\r\nthe reward for having discovered the return passage. They soon\r\narrived and declared that they had seen the islands and discovered\r\nthe return voyage. They alleged various reasons for their coming,\r\nbut brought no message from the adelantado, or news of what had\r\nhappened to him. Don Alonso de Arellano was well received by the\r\nAudiencia which was governing, where the rewarding of him and\r\nhis pilot was considered. This would have been done, had not the\r\nadelantado's flagship arrived during this time, after having made\r\nthe same voyage. It brought an authentic account of events, of the\r\nactual state of affairs, and of the settlement of Sebu. Moreover, they\r\nrelated that Don Alonso de Arellano, without receiving any orders,\r\nand without any necessity for it, had preceded the fleet with his\r\nship at the entrance of the islands, and was seen no more. They said\r\nalso that, besides those islands which had peacefully submitted to\r\nhis Majesty, there were many others, large and rich, well-inhabited,\r\nand abounding in food and gold. They hoped to pacify and reduce\r\nthose islands with the reënforcements requested. They said that the\r\nadelantado had named all the islands Filipinas, [16] in honor of his\r\nMajesty. Reënforcements were immediately sent to the adelantado,\r\nand have been sent every year, as necessity has demanded, so that\r\nthe land has been conquered and maintained.\r\n\r\nThe adelantado heard that there were other islands near Sebu,\r\nabounding in provisions, and accordingly sent some Spaniards thither\r\nto reduce the natives to peace, and bring back rice for the camp. Thus\r\nhe relieved his necessity and maintained himself as well as possible\r\nuntil, having gone to the island of Panay, he sent Martin de Goiti, his\r\nmaster-of-camp, and other captains thence to the island of Luzon with\r\nwhat men he deemed sufficient, and under the guidance of a native chief\r\nof the latter island, called Maomat, to try to pacify it and reduce it\r\nto the obedience of his Majesty. When they reached the bay of Manila,\r\nthey found its settlement on the seashore, near a large river, and\r\nunder the rule and protection of a chief called Rajamora. Opposite,\r\non the other side of the river, was another large settlement named\r\nTondo, which was likewise held by another chief named Rajamatanda. [17]\r\nThese settlements were fortified with palm-trees and stout arigues [18]\r\nfilled in with earth, and very many bronze culverins and other pieces\r\nof larger bore. Martin de Goiti, having begun to treat with the chiefs\r\nand their people concerning the peace and submission which he demanded,\r\nfound it necessary to come to blows with them. The Spaniards entered\r\nthe land by force of arms, and took it, together with the forts and\r\nartillery, on the day of St. Potenciana, May nineteen, one thousand\r\nfive hundred and seventy-one. [19] Upon this the natives and their\r\nchiefs made peace and rendered homage; and many others of the same\r\nisland of Luzon did the same. [20]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the taking of Manila and of the Spanish settlement\r\nthere reached Panay, Adelantado Legazpi set in order the affairs of\r\nSebu and other islands which he had subdued, entrusted their natives\r\nto the most reliable soldiers, and having taken the most necessary\r\nprecautions for the government of those provinces, which are commonly\r\ncalled Bicayas de los Pintados, [21] because the natives of them have\r\nall their bodies marked with fire, went to Manila with the remainder\r\nof his men. He was well received there, and established afresh with\r\nthe natives and their chiefs the peace, alliance, and homage, which\r\nhad been given. On the very site of Manila, of which Rajamora made a\r\ndonation to the Spaniards for their settlement, the adelantado founded\r\nhis town and colony, on account of its strength and its situation\r\nin a well-provisioned district, and in the midst of all the other\r\nislands. He left it its name of Manila which it had received from\r\nthe natives. [22] Taking sufficient land for the city, the governor\r\nestablished therein his seat and residence, and fortified it with\r\nspecial care. He paid more attention to the above, in order to make\r\nthis new settlement the seat of government, than to the temperature,\r\nand width of the site, which is hot and narrow from having the river\r\non one side of the city and the bay on the other, while at the back are\r\nto be found large swamps and marshes, which make the place very strong.\r\n\r\nFrom this post he continued to prosecute the pacification of the\r\nother provinces of this great island of Luzon and of surrounding\r\ndistricts. Some submitted voluntarily; others were conquered by force\r\nof arms or by the efforts of the religious, who have sown the good\r\nseed of the holy gospel therein. Various of them have labored valiantly\r\nin this, not only in the time and administration of Adelantado Miguel\r\nLopez de Legazpi, but also in that of the governors that have succeeded\r\nhim. The land was apportioned among its conquerors and colonizers. The\r\ncapitals of provinces, the ports, and the settlements of cities and\r\ntowns which had been founded, and other special encomiendas, were\r\nassigned to the royal crown, for the necessities that arise and the\r\nexpenses of the royal exchequer. The affairs of government and the\r\nconversion of the natives were treated as was necessary. Ships were\r\nprovided for the annual voyage to Nueva España, which return with the\r\nusual supplies. Thus the condition of the Filipinas Islands has reached\r\nits present known height in both spiritual and temporal matters.\r\n\r\nAdelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, as above-said, discovered the\r\nislands, colonized them, and made a good beginning in the work of\r\npacification and subjugation. He founded the city of Sanctisimo Nombre\r\nde Jesus in the provinces of Pintados, and then the city of Manila\r\nin the island of Luzon. In this island he conquered the province\r\nof Ylocos, in whose settlement and port called Vigan, he founded a\r\nSpanish colony, to which he gave the name of Villa Fernandina. [23]\r\nHe also pacified the province of Pangasinan and the island of Mindoro,\r\nfixed the amount of tribute that the natives were to pay throughout the\r\nislands, [24] and made many ordinances concerning their government and\r\nconversion, until his death in the year one thousand five hundred and\r\nseventy-four, at Manila, where his body was buried in the monastery\r\nof St. Augustine. [25]\r\n\r\nAt his death, there was found among his papers a sealed despatch from\r\nthe Audiencia of Mexico, which was governing when the fleet left\r\nNueva Españia, appointing a successor to the government, in case\r\nof the death of the adelantado. By virtue of this despatch, Guido\r\nde Labazarris, formerly a royal official, took the office and was\r\nobeyed. He continued the conversion and pacification of the islands\r\nwith great wisdom, valor, and system, and governed them.\r\n\r\nDuring his term the pirate Limahon came from China, and attacked Manila\r\nwith a fleet of seventy large war-ships and many soldiers. He entered\r\nthe city, and, after killing the master-of-camp, Martin de Goiti,\r\nwith other Spaniards who were at his house, marched against the fort,\r\nin which the Spaniards, who were but few, had taken refuge, with\r\nthe intention of seizing and subjecting the country. The Spaniards,\r\nreinforced from Vigan by Captain Joan de Salzedo and his soldiers--for\r\nSalzedo saw this pirate pass his coasts, and brought the reinforcement\r\nto Manila--defended themselves so bravely that, after having killed\r\nmany of Limahon's men, they forced him to reembark, to leave the bay\r\nin flight, and to take refuge in Pangasinan River. The Spaniards went\r\nthither in search of him and burned his fleet. [26] For many days they\r\nbesieged this pirate on land, but he, taking flight in small boats\r\nthat he made there secretly, put to sea and abandoned the islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the government of this same Guido de Labazarris, trade and\r\ncommerce were established between Great China and Manila. Merchant\r\nships came every year and the governor received them kindly, and as\r\na consequence commerce has been growing ever since.\r\n\r\nThis same governor apportioned all the pacified land in the island of\r\nLuzon and surrounding islands, to the conquerors and settlers there. He\r\nassigned to himself the towns of Betis and Lubao in the province of\r\nPampanga, besides others of some importance. The succeeding government\r\ndispossessed him of these towns; but afterward his Majesty, on account\r\nof his good services, granted them all to him, and he enjoyed them,\r\ntogether with the office of master-of-camp of the islands, as long\r\nas he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶The administration of Doctor Francisco de Sande, and the events of\r\nthe Filipinas Islands during his term.\r\n\r\n¶CHAPTER SECOND\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the entrance and conquest of the Filipinas Islands\r\nby Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, and of his death, reached Españia, his\r\nMajesty appointed as governor and captain-general of the islands,\r\nDoctor Francisco de Sande, a native of Caceres, and alcalde of the\r\nAudiencia of Mexico. The latter journeyed thither, and took over his\r\ngovernment in the year one thousand five hundred and seventy-five.\r\n\r\nDuring this administration, the pacification of the islands was\r\ncontinued, especially that of the province of Camarines, by Captain\r\nPedro Chaves, who often came to blows with the natives, until he\r\nconquered them and received their submission. A Spanish colony\r\nwas founded there which was called the city of Caceres. Among other\r\nenterprises, the governor made in person the expedition to the island\r\nof Borneo with a fleet of galleys and frigates. [27] With these he\r\nattacked and captured the enemy's fleet, which had come out to meet\r\nhim. He captured also the principal settlement, where the king of the\r\nisland had his house and residence, but after a few days he abandoned\r\nit and returned to Manila, on account of sickness among the crews,\r\nand his inability to support and care for the Spaniards in that\r\nisland. On the way back, and by his orders, Captain Estevan Rodriguez\r\nde Figueroa entered the island of Jólo; he came to blows with the\r\nnatives and their chief, whom he conquered, and the latter rendered\r\nhim acknowledgment and submission in the name of his Majesty. Thence\r\nhe went to the island of Mindanao which he explored, reconnoitering\r\nits river and chief settlements. On his way he reduced other towns and\r\nnatives of the same island, who had been pacified, to friendship and\r\nalliance with the Spaniards. The governor despatched the ship \"San\r\nJuanillo\" to Nueva España, under command of Captain Juan de Ribera,\r\nbut it was lost at sea and never heard of again.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sande remained until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa came from\r\nEspañia as the new governor and captain-general. After his residencia\r\nthe doctor returned to Nueva España to fill the office of auditor\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Of the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, and of\r\nDiego Ronquillo, who filled the office because of the former's death.\r\n\r\n¶ CHAPTER THIRD\r\n\r\nBecause of the many accounts that had reached the court of his\r\nMajesty concerning the affairs of the Filipinas, and because of their\r\nneed of being supplied with settlers and soldiers to pacify them,\r\nan arrangement was made with Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, a\r\nnative of Arevalo, and chief alguacil of the Audiencia of Mexico,\r\nwho was residing at court, so that it might be done better and at\r\nless cost to the royal exchequer. By this arrangement he was to be\r\ngovernor of the Filipinas for life and was to take six hundred married\r\nand single men from the kingdoms of Castilla to the Filipinas. His\r\nMajesty granted him certain assistance and facilities for this purpose,\r\ntogether with other favors as a reward for this service.\r\n\r\nDon Gonzalo prepared for the voyage, raised his people, and embarked\r\nthem in the port of San Lucas Barremeda, but, as the fleet left the\r\nbar, one of his ships was wrecked. He returned in order to repair his\r\nlosses, and, although he took less than at first, he made his journey\r\nto the mainland, and at Panama, embarked his people in the South Sea,\r\nand set sail for the Filipinas, where he arrived and took over the\r\ngovernment, in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nDon Gonzalo Ronquillo founded a Spanish town in the island of Panay,\r\nin Oton, which he named Arevalo. During his term, the trade with\r\nthe Chinese increased, and he built a market-place and Parián for\r\nthem within the city, where the Chinese could bring and sell their\r\nmerchandise. He tried to discover a return passage from the islands\r\nto Nueva España, by way of the south, for which purpose he sent his\r\ncousin, Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo. The latter could not\r\neffect this, for after sailing for some time, until finding himself\r\nnear Nueva Guinea, he could go no farther, on account of many severe\r\nstorms, and returned to the Filipinas. In like manner, Don Gonzalo sent\r\nanother ship, under command of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Vallesteros,\r\nto Peru, with some merchandise, in order to obtain certain goods from\r\nthose provinces which he said that the Filipinas needed. This vessel\r\nreturned from Peru after the death of the governor. The latter imposed\r\nthe two per cent duty on the merchandise exported to Nueva España,\r\nand the three per cent duty on the goods imported by the Chinese to\r\nthe Filipinas. Although he was censured for having done this without\r\nhis Majesty's orders, these duties remained in force, and continued\r\nto be imposed thenceforward.\r\n\r\nDuring this same term, as his Majesty had succeeded to the kingdoms\r\nof Portugal, and had ordered the governor of Manila to maintain\r\ngood relations with the chief captain of the fortress of the island\r\nof Tidore, in Maluco, and to assist him when necessary, he sent a\r\nfleet and soldiers thither from Manila, under command of Captain Don\r\nJuan Ronquillo del Castillo. This he did at the request of Diego de\r\nAzambuja, chief captain of Tidore, for the expedition and conquest\r\nof the island of Terrenate. But after reaching Maluco, the expedition\r\ndid not succeed in its object. [28] Thenceforward supplies of men and\r\nprovisions continued to be sent from the Filipinas to the fortress\r\nof Tidore.\r\n\r\nDuring this same administration, the province of Cagayan in the island\r\nof Luzon, opposite China, was first pacified [29] by Captain Joan\r\nPablos de Carrion, who founded there a Spanish colony, which he named\r\nNueva Segovia. He also drove a Japanese pirate [30] from that place,\r\nwho had seized the port with some ships, and fortified himself there.\r\n\r\nA few days after Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had entered into the\r\ngovernment, he sent Captain Gabriel de Ribera with a small fleet,\r\nconsisting of one galley and several frigates, to explore the coast\r\nand settlements of the island of Borneo, with orders to proceed\r\nthence to the kingdom of Patan on the mainland, where pepper is\r\nproduced. The captain having coasted along and reconnoitered Borneo,\r\nreturned with his fleet to Manila, on account of the advanced season\r\nand lack of provisions. Thence the governor sent him to España,\r\nwith authority from himself and from the islands, to confer with\r\nhis Majesty upon several matters that he desired to see carried out,\r\nand upon others which would prove advantageous to the islands. [31]\r\nThe captain found his Majesty in Portugal, gave him a few pieces of\r\ngold and other curiosities which he had brought for that purpose,\r\nand stated the matters of which he had come to treat. The result was\r\nthat his Majesty, among other favors, appointed him marshal of Bonbon,\r\nfor his hardships during this voyage, and the proper resolution was\r\nmade in the matters of which he had come to treat.\r\n\r\nIt was during the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, that the\r\nfirst bishop of the Filipinas was appointed, in the person of Don Fray\r\nDomingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, a man of great learning and\r\npiety. As soon as he arrived in the islands, he took upon himself the\r\nmanagement and jurisdiction of ecclesiastical affairs, which were at\r\nfirst in charge of the Augustinian friars who had come at the time of\r\nthe conquest, and afterwards of the discalced Franciscan religious,\r\nwho had arrived at the time of the conversion. The bishop erected his\r\ncathedral in the city of Manila, by apostolic bulls, with prebends paid\r\nby the royal exchequer, until there should be tithes and ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues to maintain themselves. Moreover, he provided whatever else\r\nwas necessary for the service and decoration of the church, and for\r\nthe divine worship which is celebrated there with great solemnity\r\nand display. Don Fray Domingo de Salazar took Antonio Sedeño and\r\nAlonso Sanchez, both priests and grave members of the Society of\r\nJesus, with him. They were the first to establish that order in the\r\nFilipinas, which, since that time, has been steadily growing, to the\r\ngreat profit and fruit of the teaching and conversion of the natives,\r\nconsolation of the Spaniards, and the education and teaching of their\r\nchildren in the studies which they pursue.\r\n\r\nDon Gonzalo Ronquillo was in such poor health from the day on which\r\nhe entered upon his administration, that he died in the year one\r\nthousand five hundred and eighty-three, and his body was buried in\r\nthe monastery of St. Augustine in Manila.\r\n\r\nHis kinsman, Diego Ronquillo, by virtue of his appointment through\r\na decree of his Majesty, succeeded him in the governorship; this man\r\ncontinued what Don Gonzalo had commenced, especially in the assistance\r\nfor Maluco and pacification for other islands.\r\n\r\nDuring the same term of Diego Ronquillo, a fire broke out in the city\r\nof Manila, which started at midday in the church of the convent of\r\nSt. Augustine, while the doors of the church were closed. The fire\r\nincreased so rapidly that all the city was burned in a few hours,\r\nas it was built of wood. There was great loss of goods and property,\r\nand some persons were in danger. The city was rebuilt with great\r\ndifficulty and labor, leaving the Spaniards very poor and needy. [32]\r\n\r\nThe main result of the matters treated at court by Mariscal Gabriel\r\nde Ribera was (although at that time the death of Governor Don\r\nGonzalo Ronquillo was unknown) to order the establishment of a\r\nroyal Audiencia in the city of Manila, whose president was to be\r\ngovernor and captain-general of all the Filipinas. In view of this,\r\nthe necessary instructions were issued, and the presidency given to\r\nDoctor Sanctiago de Vera, alcalde of the Audiencia of Mexico, and a\r\nnative of the town of Alcala de Henares. He went to the islands with\r\nthe usual reënforcements from Nueva España, taking with him the royal\r\nseal of the Audiencia, the auditors whom his Majesty was sending, the\r\nfiscal, and other officials and assistants of the said Audiencia. The\r\nauditors and fiscal were Licentiates Melchior de Avalos, Pedro de\r\nRojas, and Gaspar de Ayala--[the latter] as fiscal. At the end of\r\ntwo years, Don Antonio de Ribera went as third auditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Of the administration of Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, and of the\r\nestablishment of the Manila Audiencia, and until its suppression;\r\nand of events during his term.\r\n\r\n¶ CHAPTER FOURTH\r\n\r\nThe president and auditors arrived at the Filipinas in the month of\r\nMay, in the year 1584, while Diego Ronquillo was governing. Doctor\r\nSanctiago de Vera entered upon his office, and immediately established\r\nthe Audiencia. The royal seal was received and deposited with all\r\npossible solemnity and festivity. Then they began to attend to the\r\naffairs both of justice and of war and government, to the great profit\r\nof the country. At this time new reënforcements were sent to Maluco\r\nfor the conquests that the chief captain of Tidore intended to make\r\nof the island of Terrenate. Captain Pedro Sarmiento [33] went from\r\nManila for this purpose, and on another occasion the captain and\r\nsargento-mayor, Juan de Moron; [34] but neither of these expeditions\r\nmet with the desired result.\r\n\r\nPresident Sanctiago de Vera also continued the pacification of\r\nseveral provinces of the islands, and did many things, which\r\nproved advantageous in every respect. He discovered a rebellion\r\nand insurrection which the native chiefs of Manila and Pampanga had\r\nplanned against the Spaniards, and justice was done the guilty. [35]\r\nHe built with stone the fortress of Nuestra Señora de Guia [Our Lady\r\nof Guidance], within the city of Manila on the land side, and for\r\nits defense he caused some artillery to be founded by an old Indian,\r\ncalled Pandapira, a native of the province of Panpanga. The latter\r\nand his sons rendered this service for many years afterward, until\r\ntheir deaths.\r\n\r\nDuring the administration of President Sanctiago de Vera, the\r\nEnglishman Thomas Escander, [36] entered the South Sea through\r\nthe Strait of Magallanes; on the coast of Nueva España, close to\r\nCalifornia, he had captured the ship \"Santa Ana,\" which was coming\r\nfrom the Filipinas laden with a quantity of gold and merchandise of\r\ngreat value. Thence he proceeded to the Filipinas; entering through\r\nthe province of Pintados, he came in sight of the town of Arevalo and\r\nof the shipyard where a galleon was being built for the navigation\r\nof the Nueva España line. Wishing to burn this vessel, he made the\r\nattempt, but he was resisted by Manuel Lorenzo de Lemos, who was\r\nsupervising its construction. The Englishman passed on, and went\r\nto India, whence he took his course to Inglaterra, having followed\r\nthe same route which the Englishman Francisco Draque [Francis Drake]\r\n[37] had taken several years before. The latter had, in like manner,\r\npassed through the Strait of Magallanes to the Peruvian coast, where\r\nhe made many prizes.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the Audiencia and the bishop thought it advisable\r\nthat some person of sufficient and satisfactory qualities should be\r\nsent to España, to the court of his Majesty, to give a thorough and\r\ndetailed account of the state of affairs in the Filipinas Islands,\r\nand to request that some necessary measures might be taken concerning\r\nthem. The court was especially to be informed that, for the time being,\r\nthe Audiencia could be dispensed with, for it was a heavy burden to\r\nall estates, because of the newness of the country. The person of\r\nFather Alonso Sanches, of the Society of Jesus, a learned man, and one\r\nwell informed concerning the country, and very active in business, was\r\nchosen for this purpose. Instructions were given him, and authority to\r\nact for all estates, religious orders, and communities, as to what he\r\nwas to treat and request in España, and at the court of his Holiness\r\nin Roma, where he was also to go. [38] This father reached Madrid,\r\nand after having conferred with his Majesty several times respecting\r\nthose things of which he thought fit to treat and to make requests,\r\nwent to Roma, where he introduced himself as the ambassador of all\r\nthe estates of the Filipinas, and on their behalf he kissed the foot,\r\nand visited the pontiffs who ruled during that time, after the death\r\nof Sixtus the Fifth. Having received from them favors and indulgences\r\nwith many relics, bulls, and letters for the Filipinas, he returned to\r\nEspaña, where again he solicited a decision on the business which he\r\nhad left under discussion when he went to Roma. His Majesty listened\r\nto the messages that he brought from the pontiffs, and lent him\r\na favorable ear concerning the affairs of the islands. In private\r\naudiences the father made the king understand his requests, and decide\r\nthem to his own satisfaction. But as soon as the despatches reached\r\nthe Filipinas, much of their contents appeared outside the intention\r\nand expectation of both bishop and Audiencia, and the city, citizens,\r\nand encomenderos. They appeared even detrimental to the inhabitants\r\nof the islands, and therefore they expressed their displeasure toward\r\nFather Alonso Sanches, who was still in España. The father negotiated\r\nfor the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila, and the appointment\r\nof a new governor; and in begging such an one, the same father,\r\nbecause of his friendly relations with him, proposed one Gomez Perez\r\nDasmariñas, who had been corregidor of Leon and later of Murcia, and\r\nwho was at that time in the court, and corregidor-elect of Logroño\r\nand Calahorra. His Majesty appointed him governor and captain-general\r\nof the Filipinas, and increased the annual salary of his office to ten\r\nthousand Castilian ducados. Moreover, he made him a knight of the Order\r\nof Sanctiago, and gave him a large sum of money with which to meet the\r\nexpenses of the voyage. He was provided with the necessary despatches,\r\nboth for the exercise of his office, and for the suppression of the\r\nAudiencia of Manila, and the establishment of a camp of four hundred\r\npaid soldiers with their officers, at his Majesty's expense, for the\r\ngarrison and defense of the land. His Majesty ordered him to sail\r\nimmediately for Nueva España in the ships on which Viceroy Don Luis de\r\nVelasco sailed in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine,\r\nwho was going to govern that country.\r\n\r\nGomez Perez Dasmariñas left Mexico as soon as possible, and with what\r\nships, soldiers, and captains he needed, sailed for the Filipinas,\r\nwhere he arrived in the month of May, in the year one thousand five\r\nhundred and ninety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Of the administration of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, and of Licentiate\r\nPedro de Rojas, who was elected by the city of Manila to act as\r\ngovernor, on account of the former's death, until Don Luis Dasmariñas\r\nwas received as the successor of Gomez Perez, his father.\r\n\r\n¶ CHAPTER FIFTH\r\n\r\nAs soon as Gomez Perez Dasmariñas reached the Filipinas, he was\r\nreceived as governor with universal acclaim. He suppressed the\r\nAudiencia, and the residencias of its president, auditors, fiscal,\r\nand other officials were taken by Licentiate Herver del Coral, whom\r\nViceroy Don Luys de Velasco had sent for that purpose, by virtue of a\r\nroyal decree received to that effect. The new governor inaugurated his\r\nrule by establishing the paid garrison, and by executing, with great\r\nenthusiasm and zeal, many and various things, for which he possessed\r\nroyal orders and instructions, not shrinking from any kind of labor,\r\nor taking any care of himself. His first labor was the walling of the\r\ncity, to which he attended so assiduously, that it was almost completed\r\nbefore his death. [39] He also built a cavalier on the promontory of\r\nManila where the old wooden fort, which he called Sanctiago, formerly\r\nstood, and fortified it with some artillery. He razed to the ground\r\nthe fort of Nuestra Señora de Guia, which his predecessor had built; he\r\nbuilt of stone the cathedral of Manila, and encouraged the inhabitants\r\nof the city who had shortly before begun to build, to persevere in\r\nbuilding their houses of stone, a work which the bishop was the first\r\nto begin in the building of his house. During his term he increased\r\ntrade with China, and regulated better the navigation of Nueva España,\r\nand the despatch of vessels in that line. He built some galleys for\r\nthe defense of the coast, pacified the Zambales, who had revolted,\r\nand ordered his son Don Luys Dasmariñas, of the habit of Alcantara,\r\nto make an incursion with troops from Manila into the interior of the\r\nisland of Luzon, [40] by crossing the river Ytui and other provinces\r\nnot yet explored or seen by Spaniards, until he arrived at Cagayan. He\r\nbuilt also an artillery foundry in Manila, where, for want of expert\r\nfounders, but few large pieces were turned out.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of his administration, he sent the president and\r\nauditors of the suppressed Audiencia to España. Licentiate Pedro de\r\nRojas, the senior auditor, remained with the governor by order of\r\nhis Majesty, as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice, until some\r\nyears later appointed alcalde in Mexico.\r\n\r\nDuring Gomez Perez's administration, the relations and peace existing\r\nbetween the Japanese and the Spaniards of the Filipinas began to\r\nbecome strained; for hitherto Japanese vessels had gone from the port\r\nof Nangasaqui to Manila for some years, laden with their flour and\r\nother goods, where they had been kindly received, and despatched. But\r\nTaicosama, [41] lord of all Xapon, was incited through the efforts of\r\nFarandaquiemon--a Japanese of low extraction, one of those who came to\r\nManila--to write in a barbarous and arrogant manner to the governor,\r\ndemanding submission and tribute, and threatening to come with a fleet\r\nand troops to lay waste the country. But, between demands and replies,\r\nseveral years were spent, until at last Taico died. [42]\r\n\r\nWhile Xapon was causing the governor some anxiety, the king of Camboja\r\nsent him an embassy by the Portuguese Diego Belloso, who brought\r\na present of two elephants and offers of friendship and trade with\r\nhis kingdom, and implored aid against Sian--which was threatening\r\nCamboja. The governor answered the king, and sent him a horse, with\r\na few emeralds and other objects, but postponed until later what\r\nrelated to aid, and thanked him for his friendship. This was the\r\norigin of the events and the expeditions made later from Manila to\r\nthe kingdoms of Sian and Camboja, on the mainland of Asia.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that Gomez Perez received his charge in España, he had\r\ncherished the desire to lead an expedition from Manila to conquer the\r\nfort of Terrenate in Maluco, on account of the great importance of this\r\nenterprise, and its outcome, in which no success had been attained on\r\nother occasions. He was constantly making necessary arrangements for\r\nundertaking this expedition, but so secretly that he declared it to no\r\none, until, in the year ninety-three, seeing that the preparations for\r\nhis intention appeared sufficient, he declared his purpose, and made\r\nready to set out in person, with more than nine hundred Spaniards and\r\ntwo hundred sail, counting galleys, galliots, frigates, vireys, and\r\nother craft. He left the war affairs of Manila and of the islands, with\r\na few troops--although insufficient for the city's defense--in charge\r\nof Diego Ronquillo, his master-of-camp; and those of administration\r\nand justice to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas. He also sent his son, Don\r\nLuys Dasmariñas, forward with the rest of the fleet, as his lieutenant\r\nin the office of captain-general, to the provinces of Pintados, whence\r\nthey were to sail; while he himself remained in Manila making his final\r\npreparations and arming a galley of twenty-eight benches, in which he\r\nwas to sail. This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay,\r\n[43] whom, in order to win their good will, he would not allow to be\r\nchained, and even winked at their carrying certain weapons. About\r\nforty Spaniards embarked on the galley, and the galley itself was\r\naccompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels, in which private\r\nindividuals embarked. The governor sailed from the port of Cabit,\r\nin the month of October, one thousand five hundred and ninety-three,\r\nfor the provinces of Pintados, where they were to join the fleet which\r\nwas awaiting them there, and to proceed to Maluco. In the afternoon of\r\nthe second day of the voyage, they reached the island of Caça, [44]\r\ntwenty-four leguas from Manila, and close to the coast of the same\r\nisland of Luzon, at a place called Punta del Açufre [Sulphur Point],\r\nwhere there is a strong head wind. The galley tried to round this\r\npoint by rowing, but being unable to make any headway until the wind\r\nshould drop, they anchored and spread an awning, and stayed there that\r\nnight. Some of the vessels sailing with the galley went in closer to\r\nthe shore in sight of the galley, and awaited it there.\r\n\r\nThe governor and those who accompanied him passed the night playing\r\non the poop, until the end of the first watch. After the governor had\r\ngone into his cabin to rest, the other Spaniards went also to their\r\nquarters [45] for the same purpose, leaving the usual guards in the\r\nmidship gangway, and at the bow and stern. The Chinese rowers, who\r\nhad three days before that conspired to seize the galley whenever a\r\nfavorable opportunity presented itself--in order to avoid the labor\r\nof rowing on this expedition, and their covetousness of the money,\r\njewels, and other articles of value aboard the vessel--thought that\r\nthey should not lose their opportunity. Having provided candles, and\r\nwhite shirts with which to clothe themselves, and appointed chiefs\r\nfor its execution, they carried out their plan that same night, in\r\nthe last watch before dawn, when they perceived that the Spaniards\r\nwere asleep. At a signal which one of them gave they all at the same\r\ntime put on their shirts, lit their candles, and catan [46] in hand,\r\nattacked the guards and the men who slept in the quarters [ballesteras]\r\nand in the wales, and wounding and killing them, they seized the\r\ngalley. A few of the Spaniards escaped, some by swimming ashore,\r\nothers by means of the galley's tender, which was at the stern. When\r\nthe governor heard the noise from his cabin, thinking that the galley\r\nwas dragging and that the crew were lowering the awning and taking to\r\nthe oars, he hurried carelessly out bareheaded through the hatchway of\r\nthe cabin. Several Chinese were awaiting him there and split his head\r\nwith a catan. Thus wounded he fell down the stairs into his cabin, and\r\nthe two servants whom he kept there, carried him to his bed, where he\r\nimmediately died. The servants met the same fate from the stabs given\r\nthem through the hatch. The only surviving Spaniards in the galley\r\nwere Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Father Montilla of\r\nthe Franciscan order, who were sleeping in the cabin amidships, and\r\nwho remained there without coming out; nor did the Chinese, thinking\r\nthat there were more Spaniards, dare to go in until next day, when\r\nthey took the two men out and later put them ashore on the coast of\r\nYlocos, in the same island of Luzon, in order that the natives might\r\nallow them to take water on shore, which they badly needed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Spaniards who were in the other vessels, close to the\r\nland, perceived the lights and heard the noise made in the galley\r\nfrom their ships, they thought that some work was being done; and when\r\nshortly afterward, they learned what was happening from those who had\r\nescaped by swimming, they could render no assistance and kept still,\r\nas everything was lost, and they were few and not in sufficient force\r\ntherefor. They waited for the morning, and when it began to dawn,\r\nthey saw that the galley had already set its bastard, and was sailing,\r\nwind astern toward China, and they were unable to pursue it.\r\n\r\nThe galley sailed with a favorable wind all along the coast of\r\nthe island until leaving it. It took some water at Ylocos, where\r\nthe secretary and the religious were abandoned. The Chinese tried\r\nto make for China, but not being able to fetch it, they ported in\r\nthe kingdom of Cochinchina, where the king of Tunquin seized their\r\ncargo and two large pieces of artillery which were intended for the\r\nexpedition of Maluco, the royal standard, and all the jewels, money,\r\nand articles of value; the galley he left to drift ashore, and the\r\nChinese dispersed and fled to different provinces. Governor Gomez Perez\r\nmet this unfortunate death, whereupon the expedition and enterprise\r\nto Maluco, which the governor had undertaken, ceased also. Thus ended\r\nhis administration, after he had ruled somewhat more than three years.\r\n\r\nAmong other despatches which Gomez Perez Dasmariñas brought from España\r\nthere was an order from his Majesty which authorized him to appoint\r\nthe person whom he thought best to succeed him in case of death,\r\nuntil such time as his Majesty should appoint his successor. He\r\nshowed this order to several of the most important persons of the\r\nisland, giving each one to understand that he would be appointed,\r\nespecially to Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, an inhabitant\r\nof Pintados, a rich man of merit, and one of the first conquerors\r\nof the land. To him the governor showed an appointment drawn in his\r\nfavor. He made use of the captain on all occasions and had him go with\r\nhimself to Maluco. The news of the seizure of the galley was soon\r\nknown in Manila. The citizens and soldiers that had remained there,\r\nassembled at the house of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, to discuss\r\nadvisable measures. First of all they elected the latter governor\r\nand captain-general. Then they sent Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del\r\nCastillo and other captains with two frigates (for there were no other\r\nvessels) in pursuit of the galley, a fruitless attempt, for the galley\r\nwas nowhere to be seen. The new governor also sent a message to Don\r\nLuis Dasmariñas and to the army and fleet who were awaiting Gomez\r\nPerez in Pintados, informing him of the latter's death and of what\r\nhad happened, as well as of his own recent election to affairs of\r\ngovernment. He also ordered them to return with all speed to Manila,\r\nfor the city was left almost deserted, and without the necessary\r\nprecautions for any emergency.\r\n\r\nThe news caused great grief in the fleet. Don Luys Dasmariñas and\r\nCaptain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, each in his own heart, was\r\ncertain that he was to become governor, taking it for granted that\r\nthe governor had nominated him for the office. With this hope, both\r\nof them with the best ships and crews of the fleet, set sail together\r\nfor Manila with the utmost speed.\r\n\r\nLicentiate Pedro de Rojas, anxious about this provision, which the\r\ngovernor would leave among his papers and drawers deposited in the\r\nmonastery of St. Augustine in Manila, in the possession of Fray Diego\r\nMuñoz, prior and commissary of the Holy Office, made the effort to\r\ngain possession of them. Although he seized some of them, he did not\r\nfind the said provision, for the prior had anticipated him and set\r\naside one of the drawers, in which the provision was supposed to be\r\nfound, to await Don Luys Dasmariñas's arrival in the city. Juan de\r\nCuellar, who had escaped from the galley, arrived from the province\r\nof Ylocos, and testified that an appointment for the succession to the\r\ngovernorship had been made by Gomez Perez, but he did not state whom;\r\nor among what papers the nomination could be found. Thereupon the\r\nlicentiate Pedro de Rojas and those devoted to him became more anxious.\r\n\r\nForty days passed in this manner, at the end of which Don Luis\r\nappeared in the bay near the city, accompanied by Estevan Rodriguez\r\nand many men; and there he anchored, not choosing to enter the city,\r\nor to disembark. He caused a search to be made for the papers kept\r\nin St. Augustine, and among them was found the royal order and the\r\nnomination of Don Luys Dasmariñas to succeed to the governorship. One\r\nof his partisans announced the fact to the city magistrates, who,\r\nchanging their ideas, and notwithstanding some opposition from the\r\npartisans of Licentiate Rojas, summoned Don Luys Dasmariñas to the\r\nmunicipal house and placed him in possession of the government. The\r\nsame was done by the soldiers whom Don Luys had with him, and by the\r\nfleet. Each day brought a new disappointment to Licentiate Rojas,\r\nwho returned to his office of lieutenant-assessor, after a rule of\r\nforty days.\r\n\r\nIf the death of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmariñas was an unfortunate\r\nevent, both for the loss of his person and for the loss of a so good\r\nopportunity for the conquest of Terrenate, when all were certain of\r\nsuccess, the return of the fleet and the arrival of the troops in\r\nthe city was none the less a fortunate event, for, not many days\r\nafter--having anticipated their usual time for the voyage--there\r\narrived in Manila many Chinese ships which carried many men and\r\nlittle merchandise, and seven mandarins bearing the insignia of\r\ntheir office. This gave sufficient motive for suspecting that they\r\nhad heard of the departure of the fleet for Maluco and of the city's\r\nlack of defense, and that they had therefore come on this occasion\r\nto try to seize the country. But they desisted from the attempt\r\nwhen they found the city with more troops than ever. They returned\r\nto China without showing any other particular motive for coming,\r\nand without either side showing that their motives were understood;\r\nexcept that Governor Don Luys was watchful and on his guard. He\r\ntook the proper measures, especially those concerning the Chinese,\r\nand their settlement and Parián.\r\n\r\nNo ships went to Nueva España from the Filipinas that year, because\r\nGovernor Gomez Perez, before starting on the expedition to Maluco, had\r\nsent there the vessels \"San Felipe\" and \"San Francisco,\" both of which,\r\non account of heavy storms, had to put back, the \"San Felipe\" to the\r\nport of Sebu and the \"San Francisco\" to Manila, and they were unable\r\nto resail until the following year. It was suspected in Nueva España\r\nthat there were troubles in the islands because of the non-arrival\r\nof the ships, and persons were not wanting to affirm more than had\r\nreally happened; nor was it possible at the same time--in the town\r\nof Mexico--to ascertain whence the news had emanated. This was very\r\nshortly known in España, by way of India, letters having been sent\r\nto Venecia [Venice], through Persia; and immediately they set about\r\nappointing a new governor.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the government of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, the need\r\nof an Audiencia began to be felt by many, upon their seeing all the\r\npower vested in one man, and that there was no one to whom they could\r\napply for remedy for certain cases. [47] He who felt this most keenly\r\nwas Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar, who had had certain differences\r\nand disputes with the governor, which obliged him to start for España,\r\nnotwithstanding his advanced age. The governor readily gave him leave\r\nfor that year, and a vessel for the voyage, in order to rid himself of\r\nhim; but at the same time and with full power from himself, he sent\r\nFray Francisco de Ortega of the Augustinian order to court, to meet\r\nwhatever the bishop might allege and to defend his side. Both reached\r\nEspaña, and each spoke as his interests demanded. The chief thing\r\ninsisted upon by the bishop was a request for the reëstablishment\r\nof the Audiencia, and the foundation of other bishoprics in the\r\nFilipinas, besides that of Manila, as well as other things which he\r\nthought beneficial to the spiritual and temporal welfare. In all this\r\nhe was opposed by Ortega. But the authority and piety of the bishop\r\nwere of such weight, that, although at first the cause that made him,\r\nat his advanced age, leave his church, and travel five thousand leguas\r\nto España, seemed trivial, afterward he was favorably received by his\r\nMajesty and the Council and all his petitions and propositions were\r\nconsidered and discussed at length, and many consultations were held\r\nwith his Majesty, in order to have a decision passed upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the same year of ninety-three in which Gomez Perez died in the\r\nFilipinas, the Council after consulting with his Majesty, resolved\r\nthat the office of lieutenant-assessor in judicial matters, which had\r\nbeen filled by Licentiate Pedro de Roxas since the suppression of the\r\nAudiencia, should be made more important than formerly in order to\r\nfacilitate matters; that the title of the office should thereafter be\r\nthat of lieutenant-general; and that in judicial matters the holder\r\nof it should have authority to hear cases of appeal not exceeding\r\nthe value of one thousand Castilian ducados. Thereupon Licentiate\r\nPedro de Rojas was promoted to the office of alcalde of Mexico,\r\nand Doctor Antonio de Morga was appointed by his Majesty to take the\r\nlatter's residencia, and to the office of lieutenant-general of the\r\nFilipinas. In the course of his journey the latter arrived at Nueva\r\nEspaña in the beginning of the year ninety-four, and found that the\r\nships which, as abovesaid, had failed to come from the Filipinas,\r\nhad not arrived. Moreover the death of Gomez Perez, and the other\r\nevents that had occurred, were unknown until the arrival of Don Juan\r\nde Velasco, in the month of November of the same year, in the galleon\r\n\"Sanctiago,\" which had been sent to the islands the year before by\r\nViceroy Don Luys de Velasco, with the necessary supplies. He brought\r\nnews of the governor's death and of the succession to the office by\r\nthe latter's son, Don Luys Dasmariñas. Men and fresh supplies for the\r\nislands were prepared immediately and together with many passengers and\r\nreligious from España, Doctor Antonio de Morga embarked in the port of\r\nAcapulco, in the galleons \"San Felipe\" and \"Santiago,\" with everything\r\nunder his charge. He set sail March twenty-two of ninety-five, and\r\narrived under fair weather in the port of Cabit, June eleven of the\r\nsame year. He entered upon his office of lieutenant-general, and began\r\nto occupy himself with his duties and the other matters in his charge.\r\n\r\nWhile Don Luys Dasmariñas was governing, the suspicions and fear\r\nof Xapon continued, which, together with the Chinese trouble, kept\r\nthe people in continual anxiety. The governor sent his cousin, Don\r\nFernando de Castro, with letters and despatches to the viceroy of\r\nCanton and to that of Chincheo, where many of the Chinese who had\r\nseized the galley and killed Governor Gomez Perez, were thought to\r\nbe found. Supposing that they had gone there with the galley, the\r\ngovernor requested the Chinese authorities to deliver the culprits\r\nfor punishment, and to restore the royal standard, artillery, and\r\nother things which had been seized. This was not obtained, for as\r\nthe galley had gone to Cochinchina, and the Chinese had dispersed in\r\nso many directions, it could not be effected. However, after several\r\ndays, some of the guilty Chinese were brought from Malaca to Manila,\r\nhaving been captured there by the chief captain, Francisco de Silva\r\nde Meneses. From these men more accurate information was derived\r\nconcerning what had happened in the seizure of the galley and of the\r\ngovernor's death, and justice was dealt them.\r\n\r\nIn the year ninety-four, when Don Luys was governor, a large junk came\r\nto the Filipinas with some Cambodians and Siamese, several Chinese and\r\nthree Spaniards--one a Castilian, named Blaz Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez,\r\nand the other two Portuguese called Pantaleon Carnero and Antonio\r\nMachado. While they were in the city of Chordemuco, [48] in Camboja,\r\nwith Prauncar [49] Langara, king of Camboja, the king of Sian attacked\r\nthe former king with many soldiers and elephants, conquered the land,\r\nand seized the house and the treasures of the king, who, with his wife,\r\nmother, sister, and his one daughter, and two sons, fled inland to\r\nthe kingdom of Lao. The king of Sian leaving some of his captains\r\nto guard Camboja returned to his home with the rest of the army,\r\nsending what booty he could not carry away by land, to Sian by sea\r\nin several junks. He captured the Portuguese and Castilians whom he\r\nfound there [i.e., in Camboja], and embarked the above mentioned three\r\nwith other Cambodian slaves on board this junk, besides many goods,\r\nand with a Siamese guard and a Chinese crew. While they were at sea,\r\nthe three Spaniards, aided by the Chinese, took possession of the\r\njunk, and killed and imprisoned the Siamese guards. After that the\r\nSpaniards and the Chinese came to blows as to who should have the\r\nprize and where it was to be taken. The three Spaniards overcame the\r\nChinese, and killing most of them, took the junk to Manila with all\r\nits cargo, and the vessel was adjudged to them. Liberty was granted\r\nto the Cambodians as well as to the Chinese who had survived the fray.\r\n\r\nThe king of Sian reached his court in the city of Odia [50] and\r\nwaited for the arrival of the junk; but seeing that it delayed longer\r\nthan was necessary, he suspected that it had been seized or lost,\r\nand desired to send someone to bring him news of it and the reason\r\nfor the delay. Among the prisoners he had made in Camboja was the\r\nPortuguese, Diego Belloso, who had been sent to Manila in the time\r\nof Gomez Perez Dasmariñas by King Prauncar Langara, to request his\r\nfriendship and assistance against Sian which was then threatening him,\r\nas abovesaid. On his return to Camboja with the governor's answer and\r\npresent, Belloso found that the Siamese had seized the country and\r\nhad occupied it. Accordingly they captured him, and the Siamese king\r\nseized the present which he carried off with the other captures to his\r\ncountry. This Diego Belloso, getting wind of the king's intention, had\r\nword sent to the latter that, if he were to send him on this business,\r\nhe would go as far as Manila, since he knew that archipelago so well,\r\nand find out what had happened to the junk. At the same time he said\r\nthat he would establish friendship and commerce in the king's name\r\nwith the Spaniards, and would procure many European curiosities for\r\nhim, which were to be found in Manila, especially a colored stone\r\nlarge enough to serve as a hilt for the two-handed sword which the\r\nking used--a thing which the king greatly desired on account of\r\na smaller one that he had found among the presents, and which he\r\ncarried before him when on his elephant. The king agreed to this and\r\nhad a junk prepared; he sent in it a Siamese who was in his service,\r\nand all the other men necessary for the voyage, together with Diego\r\nBelloso. He sent two elephants to the governor of Manila, and a\r\nquantity of benzoin, ivory, and other merchandise for sale, with\r\nthe proceeds of which they were to buy the curiosities mentioned by\r\nBelloso. Having set sail they encountered a storm, and the junk put in\r\nat Malaca, where they learned that the other junk of the Siamese king,\r\nfor which they were looking, had been seized, and that the Spaniards\r\nwho had embarked as prisoners at Camboja, had taken it with all its\r\ncargo to Manila, after killing the Siamese guards.\r\n\r\nAt this news the Siamese king's servant began to look less favorably\r\nupon the journey to Manila, and accordingly, although against Belloso's\r\ndesire, began to discharge and sell the goods in Malaca with the\r\nintention of returning immediately to Sian. One morning this servant\r\nof the Siamese king, Aconsi [51] by name, was found dead in the junk,\r\nalthough he had retired safe and sound the night before. Thereupon\r\nDiego Belloso became master of the situation, and after again embarking\r\nthe goods and elephants on the junk, left Malaca, and journeyed to\r\nManila. There he found Don Luys Dasmariñas acting as governor, because\r\nof his father Gomez Perez's death. To him he gave the present of the\r\nelephants, which he brought from the king, and told him what else had\r\nbeen sent. The other goods and merchandise were offered for sale by\r\nanother Siamese who represented his king's service in the same junk.\r\n\r\nBelloso met Blas Ruys de Hernan Gonçales and his two companions in\r\nManila. Among them all they agreed to persuade Governor Don Luys to\r\nsend a fleet to Camboja to aid King Langara who was living in exile and\r\nstripped of his kingdom. They alleged that it would be easy to restore\r\nthe king to power, and that at the same time the Spaniards might\r\ngain a foothold on the mainland, where they could settle and fortify\r\nthemselves, whence would follow other important and more considerable\r\nresults. They called on the religious of the Order of St. Dominic to\r\nsupport them before the governor in this plan. These easily put the\r\nmatter on such good footing--for the governor followed their advice\r\nin everything that it was decided to prepare a fleet with as many\r\nmen as possible, under command of the captain and sargento-mayor,\r\nJuan Xuarez Gallinato, himself in a ship of moderate size. He was\r\nto be accompanied by two junks: one under command of Diego Belloso,\r\nand the other under that of Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonçalez, with one\r\nhundred and twenty Spaniards, some Japanese and native Indians,\r\nand all else that was necessary.\r\n\r\nThis resolution seemed inexpedient to the majority of people in the\r\ncity, both because it took so many men away, and also, because the\r\nsuccess of the expedition seemed very doubtful. Admitting reports\r\nthat the country of Camboja was in the hands of the king of Sian,\r\nwho held it with sufficient forces--and nothing else was known--the\r\nresult of the expedition would be to make the king of Sian--from whom\r\nthe governor had just received presents and a friendly embassy in the\r\nperson of Belloso--their declared enemy. And without sending the king\r\nan answer they were about to take up arms against him in favor of one\r\nwho was unknown to them, and from whom the Spaniards had received\r\nneither pledges nor obligations. Lieutenant-general Don Antonio\r\nde Morga and Master-of-camp Diego Ronquillo, together with other\r\ncaptains and influential persons, spoke of this matter to Don Luys,\r\nand even requested him in writing to desist from this expedition. But\r\nalthough he had no reasons on his side to satisfy them, he was so\r\ntaken by the expedition, that, inasmuch as the said religious of\r\nSt. Dominic upheld him, he would not change his plans. Accordingly\r\nhe despatched the fleet to the kingdom of Camboja at the beginning\r\nof the year ninety-six, which is generally one week's voyage. On the\r\nother hand, he dismissed the Siamese who had accompanied Belloso,\r\nwithout any definite answer to the embassy of the king of Siam,\r\nto whom he sent in return for his presents, some products of the\r\ncountry, which he thought appropriate. The Siamese, seeing that they\r\nwere being sent back to their country, were satisfied, and expected\r\nno other result of their coming.\r\n\r\nA storm overtook the fleet, and the flagship which carried Juan\r\nXuarez Gallinato and the majority of the Spaniards, took refuge\r\nin the strait of Sincapura near Malaca, where it remained for many\r\ndays. The other two junks which carried Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz\r\nwith some Spaniards, Japanese, and natives of Manila, reached Camboja\r\nwith great difficulty, and Blas Ruyz, preceding Belloso, went up the\r\nriver Mecon as far as the city of Chordemuco. There they learned\r\nthat the mandarins of Camboja had united against the Siamese whom\r\nthey had conquered and driven from the kingdom; and that one of these\r\nmandarins, Anacaparan by name, had taken possession of the country,\r\nand was governing under the title of king, although against the will of\r\nthe others. Diego Belloso, Blas Ruyz, and those with them thought that\r\nthey had arrived in good season for the furtherance of their designs,\r\nsince confusion reigned among the Cambodians, and the Siamese were\r\nout of the country. Expecting Gallinato and the flagship to arrive\r\ndirectly, they spent several days in Chordemuco with the permission\r\nof Anacaparan, who resided nine leguas away in Sistor. Although the\r\nlatter knew of the entry of these ships and their men, and that many\r\nmore were coming, whose intentions he knew; and although he thought\r\nthat it would not be favorable to him: yet he dissembled with them,\r\nwaiting to see what time would bring. At the same time six Chinese\r\nships with their merchandise arrived in Chordemuco and, while they\r\nwere discharging it, the Chinese being many and hating the Spaniards,\r\nbehaved towards them with great arrogance and insolence. This obliged\r\nthe Spaniards, for the sake of their reputation, and in order to\r\navenge themselves for injuries received, to take up arms against\r\nthe Chinese. This they did, killing many Chinese and seizing their\r\nships and all their cargo. Anacaparan took offense at this, and was\r\ndesirous for the Chinese to avenge themselves by his aid. To remedy\r\nthis evil Fray Alonso Ximenez, [52] of the Dominican order, who\r\naccompanied the Spaniards, thought that he, together with Blas Ruys\r\nand Diego Belloso, and about fifty Spaniards, a few Japanese, and men\r\nfrom Luzon, should leave the rest to guard the ships in Chordemuco,\r\nand should go up in small boats to Sistor, in order to obtain an\r\ninterview with Anacaparan and offer him excuses and satisfaction\r\nfor the trouble that they had had with the Chinese. And in order to\r\nnegotiate with him more easily, they made a letter of embassy in the\r\nname of the governor of Manila, because Gallinato carried with him\r\nthe one given them by the governor. This device was of little service\r\nto them, because Anacaparan not only did not grant them audience,\r\nbut after having seized their boats, kept them so hard pressed in a\r\nlodging outside the city, and so threatened that he would kill them,\r\nif they did not return the ships and what they had taken from them\r\nto the Chinese, that the Spaniards were quite anxious to return to\r\nChordemuco and board their vessels for greater security. They decided\r\nto do so as best they could.\r\n\r\nTheir necessity, and beholding themselves in this danger, encouraged\r\nthem, one night, although at great risk, to leave their lodgings, and\r\nfind a passage where they could cross the river to the city side. They\r\ncrossed the river, arms in hand, late at night, and as silently as\r\npossible. Finding themselves near the city, and their courage and\r\ndetermination increasing, they entered the city and went as far\r\nas the king's house. They set fire to it, to the magazines, and to\r\nother buildings on their way, and threw the Cambodians into so great\r\nconfusion, that that night and the following morning they killed many\r\npeople, among them King Anacaparan himself. After this they thought it\r\nunwise to advance or maintain their ground, and accordingly marched\r\nback to their ships as orderly as possible. Meanwhile a great number\r\nof Cambodians, with arms and several elephants, started to pursue the\r\nSpaniards and overtook them before the latter reached their ships. The\r\nSpaniards defended themselves valiantly, and continued their march\r\nuntil embarking without the loss of a single man, while the Cambodians\r\nreturned to the city with some of their men killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nDiego Belloso and Bias Ruiz had hardly boarded their ships, when\r\nCaptain Gallinato entered Chordemuco with the flagship, by way of the\r\nriver. They told him all that happened with the Chinese and Cambodians\r\nand of the favorable condition of affairs for continuing them, alleging\r\nthat, since the usurper Anacaparan was dead, many Cambodians would\r\nimmediately join the Spaniards in defense of the name and fame of\r\nLangara their legitimate king. But, although some of the Cambodians\r\nthemselves came to visit the fleet, and assured Gallinato of the same,\r\nof the death of Anacaparan, and of the deeds of the Spaniards in\r\nSistor, he appeared to give no credit to any of them, and could not\r\nbe induced to believe them, or to continue the enterprise, or even\r\nto consider it. On the contrary he rebuked the Spaniards for what had\r\ntaken place in his absence, and after depriving them of all that they\r\nhad seized from the Chinese and Cambodians, put to sea in order to\r\nreturn to Manila. Belloso and Blas Ruiz persuaded him to go at least\r\nto Cochinchina, where the galley seized when Governor Gomez Perez was\r\nkilled was said to have been taken, and where were the royal standard\r\nand the artillery carried aboard the galley, and for which he should\r\nask. They promised, while Gallinato was making these negotiations,\r\nto go overland to the kingdom of Lao, where Langara, king of Camboja,\r\nwas living, in order to restore him to his kingdom. Captain Gallinato\r\nconsented to this, and sailed along the coast, until he entered the\r\nbay of Cochinchina, where, although he was apparently well received\r\nby the natives of the country, he would not disembark from his ships,\r\nbut sent Gregorio de Vargas from them to visit the king of Tunquin,\r\nthe chief king of that kingdom, and to treat with him concerning the\r\ngalley, the standard, and the artillery. While he was thus engaged,\r\nGallinato allowed Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso to go ashore to endeavor\r\nto make the journey to Lao, for he agreed easily to their request\r\nbecause he thus got rid of them and left them busied in this matter,\r\nso that they could not do him any ill turn in Manila in regard to\r\nleaving Camboja.\r\n\r\nDiego Belloso and Blas Ruyz went to the king of Sinua, son of the king\r\nof Tunquin, and begged him to help them in their journey. From him they\r\nreceived all that was necessary, and were well treated and served until\r\nthey reached the city of Alanchan, [53] capital of the kingdom of Lao,\r\nwhere they were kindly received by the king of the country. They found\r\nthat Prauncar Langara, king of Camboja, and his elder son and daughter\r\nhad died, and that only his son Prauncar survived, and the latter's\r\nstepmother, grandmother, and aunts. They related the condition of\r\naffairs in Camboja, the arrival of the Spaniards, and the death of\r\nthe usurper Anacaparan. The same news was brought by a Cambodian\r\nfrom Chordemuco, who also added that since the death of Anacaparan,\r\nhis younger son Chupinanu was reigning, that the country was entirely\r\ndivided into factions, and that many upon seeing their natural and\r\nlawful king would leave Chupinanu and would join him and obey him.\r\n\r\nThe few difficulties for the departure having been overcome by the\r\narrival at this time of the mandarin Ocuña de Chu at Lanchan, in Lao\r\n[54] from Camboja, who had been sent by order of other mandarins and\r\ngrandees of Camboja with ten praus well equipped with artillery and\r\nweapons to fetch their lawful king, it was decided to go down to\r\nCamboja. Prauncar, his grandmother, aunt, and stepmother--he wife\r\nof Langara--together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz, embarked\r\nand journeyed in the said boats and praus down the rivers flowing\r\nfrom Lao to Camboja. [55] There they found fresh disturbances in the\r\nprovinces. But as soon as Prauncar arrived many went over to his side,\r\nespecially two Moro Malays, Acuña La Casamana [56] and Cancona, who\r\nwere in the country with a Malay army and a quantity of artillery and\r\nelephants. Prauncar was victorious on various occasions, and Chupinanu\r\nwith his brothers and other rebels having died in battle, became master\r\nof almost all the provinces of his kingdom. He made Diego Belloso and\r\nBlas Ruyz chiefs in war affairs, and they managed war matters until\r\nthey completely established Prauncar on the throne. When the war was\r\nalmost entirely ended, the king made Belloso and Blas Ruyz great chofas\r\n[57] of his kingdom, gave them two provinces, and granted them other\r\nfavors, although not so many as they expected, or as he had promised\r\nwhile still in Lao. The chief reason for this was the stepmother,\r\ngrandmother, and aunt of the king, who managed him, on account of\r\nhis youth, and of his being addicted to wine, in excess even of his\r\nfather Langara. The Moro Malay, Acuña Lacasamana, had great influence\r\nwith these women. Being envious of the valor of the Spaniards, he was\r\ncontinually opposing them, and seeking their destruction, with whom,\r\non this account, they were always at odds. It must be understood\r\nthat this Moro held unlawful relations with the wife of Langara,\r\nthe stepmother of King Prauncar.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gallinato's fleet remained in Cochinchina negotiating with\r\nthe king of Tunquin for the royal standard and the artillery of the\r\ngalley, as above stated, for the galley was lost upon that coast,\r\nand this king had the rest in his possession. The latter not only did\r\nnot restore them, but entertaining Gallinato with flattering speech,\r\nwas, on the contrary, planning to take from him his ships and their\r\ncontents. Gallinato was secretly warned of this by one of the chief\r\nwomen of Cochinchina, who came to the fleet to see him, after which\r\nhe kept a much more careful watch than before, and allowed no one to\r\ngo ashore. But this order was of no avail with Fray Alonso Ximenez,\r\none of the Dominican religious whom he had with him, and the chief\r\npromoter of the expedition. When the latter went ashore, they seized\r\nand kept him there. The Cochinchinese, imagining that the fleet was\r\noff its guard, sent some fire ships against it, followed by some\r\ngalleys and warboats, in order to burn it, while many men armed with\r\narquebuses annoyed the Spaniards from the neighboring shore. The fleet\r\nsucceeded in getting away from the fire and put off from shore, and\r\nresisted the enemy's ships with artillery, musketry, and arquebuses,\r\nthus sinking some of them. After this the Spaniards waited no longer,\r\nbut leaving Fray Alonso Ximenez on shore, and two lay companions,\r\nwhom he took with him, put to sea and left the bay of Cochinchina,\r\nand ran toward the Filipinas.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening in Camboja and Cochinchina, orders\r\nhad arrived from España from his Majesty to conclude an agreement\r\nthat Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had made with Gomez Perez\r\nDasmariñas, under which the former was to pacify and settle the island\r\nof Mindanao at his own expense, and receive the governorship of the\r\nisland for two lives [58] and other rewards. The said agreement was\r\neffected, after certain difficulties that arose were settled. Don\r\nEstevan Rodriguez prepared men and ships, and what else was necessary\r\nfor the enterprise, and with some galleys, galleots, frigates, vireys,\r\nbarangays, and lapis, [59] set out with two hundred and fourteen\r\nSpaniards for the island of Mindanao, in February of the same year,\r\nof ninety-six. He took Captain Juan de la Xara as his master-of-camp,\r\nand some religious of the Society of Jesus to give instruction,\r\nas well as many natives for the service of the camp and fleet.\r\n\r\nHe reached Mindanao River, after a good voyage, where the first\r\nsettlements, named Tancapan and Lumaguan, both hostile to the people\r\nof Buhahayen, received him peacefully and in a friendly manner, and\r\njoined his fleet. They were altogether about six thousand men. Without\r\ndelay they advanced about eight leguas farther up the river against\r\nBuhahayen, the principal settlement of the island, where its greatest\r\nchief had fortified himself on many sides. Arrived at the settlement,\r\nthe fleet cast anchor, and immediately landed a large proportion of\r\nthe troops with their arms. But before reaching the houses and fort,\r\nand while going through some thickets [çacatal] [60] near the shore,\r\nthey encountered some of the men of Buhahayen, who were coming to\r\nmeet them with their campilans, carazas [61] and other weapons, and\r\nwho attacked them on various sides. The latter [i.e., the Spaniards\r\nand their allies], on account of the swampiness of the place and\r\nthe denseness of the thickets [çacatal], could not act unitedly as\r\nthe occasion demanded, although the master-of-camp and the captains\r\nthat led them exerted themselves to keep the troops together and\r\nto encourage them to face the natives. Meanwhile Governor Estevan\r\nRodriguez de Figueroa was watching events from his flagship, but not\r\nbeing able to endure the confusion of his men, seized his weapons\r\nand hastened ashore with three or four companions, and a servant who\r\ncarried his helmet, in order that he might be less impeded in his\r\nmovements. But as he was crossing a part of the thickets [çacatal]\r\nwhere the fight was waging, a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from\r\none side, and dealt the governor a blow on the head with his campilan,\r\nthat stretched him on the ground badly wounded. [62] The governor's\r\nfollowers cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back to\r\nthe camp. Shortly after, the master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, withdrew\r\nhis troops to the fleet, leaving behind several Spaniards who had\r\nfallen in the encounter. The governor did not regain consciousness,\r\nfor the wound was very severe, and died next day. The fleet after that\r\nloss and failure left that place, and descended the river to Tampacan,\r\nwhere it anchored among the friendly inhabitants and their settlements.\r\n\r\nThe master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, had himself chosen by the fleet\r\nas successor in the government and enterprise. He built a fort with\r\narigues and palms near Tampacan, and founded a Spanish settlement to\r\nwhich he gave the name of Murcia. He began to make what arrangements he\r\ndeemed best, in order to establish himself and run things independently\r\nof, and without acknowledging the governor of Manila, without whose\r\nintervention and assistance this enterprise could not be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the administration of Don Francisco Tello, and of the second\r\nestablishment of the Audiencia of Manila; and of occurrences during\r\nthe period of this administration.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTH\r\n\r\nGovernor Don Luis Dasmariñas was awaiting news from Captain Juan\r\nXuarez Gallinato, and from Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa\r\nconcerning the voyage which each had made at the beginning of the year\r\nninety-six, to Camboja and to Mindanao, when news reached Manila,\r\nin the month of June, that two ships had entered the islands by the\r\nchannel of Espiritu Santo, and that they brought a new governor sent\r\nfrom España, namely, Don Francisco Tello de Guzman, knight of the Order\r\nof Sanctiago, a native of Sevilla, and treasurer of the India House\r\nof Trade. He arrived at Manila in the beginning of July and entered\r\nupon his office. It was also learned that Fray Ygnacio Sanctivañez,\r\nof the Order of St. Francis, a native of Sanctivañez, in the province\r\nof Burgos, had been nominated in Nueva España as archbishop of Manila,\r\nfor Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar had died in Madrid; and that Fray\r\nMiguel de Venavides, a native of Carrion and a religious of the Order\r\nof St. Dominic, who had gone to España with Bishop Fray Domingo de\r\nSalazar, had been appointed bishop of the city of Segovia in the\r\nprovince of Cagayan; also that Fray Pedro de Agurto, of the Order\r\nof St. Augustine, a native of Mexico, had been appointed in Mexico,\r\nbishop of the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus, and that these\r\ntwo bishops with another for the city of Caceres, in the province\r\nof Camarines, who was not yet named, had been lately added to the\r\nFilipinas and appointed as suffragans to the archbishop of Manila,\r\nat the instance of Bishop Fray Domingo. Also it was learned that the\r\nAudiencia which had been suppressed in Manila was to be reëstablished\r\nthere, as well as other things which the bishop had presented at court.\r\n\r\nShortly after Don Francisco Tello had taken over the governorship, news\r\nwas brought of the death of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa in Mindanao,\r\nby Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus. The latter brought\r\nthe body for burial in the college of Manila, of which Don Estevan\r\nwas patron. Juan de la Xara wrote that he had charge of affairs,\r\nthat he had settled in Tampacan, that he intended to continue the\r\npacification and conquest of the island as should seem most advisable,\r\nand that reënforcements of men and other things should be sent him. It\r\nwas learned that he intended to make an ill use of the government,\r\nand would not remain dependent on, and subordinate to, the governor\r\nof the Filipinas; and that he was depriving the heirs of Estevan\r\nRodriguez of what lawfully belonged to them. It was learned that,\r\nin order to make himself safer in this respect, he was sending his\r\nconfidants to the town of Arevalo in Oton where Don Estevan had\r\nleft his wife, Doña Ana de Osseguera, and his two small daughters,\r\nwith his house and property, to persuade Doña Ana to marry him. This\r\nresolution appeared injurious in many respects, and the attempt was\r\nmade to rectify matters. But in order not to disturb the affairs\r\nof Mindanao, the matter was left alone for the present, until time\r\nshould show the course to be followed. And so it happened that when\r\nJuan de la Xara left the camp and settlements of Mindanao, and came\r\nhurriedly to Oton to negotiate his marriage in person--although the\r\nwidow of Don Estevan had never been favorable to it--Don Francisco\r\nTello sent men to arrest him. He was brought to Manila, where he died\r\nwhile his trial was being conducted.\r\n\r\nAfter the imprisonment of Juan de La Xara, Don Francisco Tello\r\nimmediately sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, with orders\r\nto take command of the camp and to govern, until some one should\r\nagree to continue the enterprise. When he arrived at Mindanao and the\r\nsoldiers saw that Juan de La Xara's schemes had been defeated, and\r\nthat the latter was a prisoner in Manila, with no hope of returning,\r\nthey obeyed Toribio de Miranda and the orders that he brought.\r\n\r\nIn Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary\r\nmeasures for continuing the war, since the island of Mindanao was so\r\nnear the other pacified islands, and the island itself contained some\r\nprovinces that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas,\r\nand had Spanish magistrates, such as the rivers of Butuan, Dapitan,\r\nand Caragan, so that it was desirable to pacify the whole island and\r\nsubject it to his Majesty. The royal treasury was spent and could\r\nnot bear the expense; and Estevan Rodriguez had bound himself by a\r\nlegal writ, to carry the war to entire completion at his own expense,\r\nin accordance with the terms of his agreement. The guardian of his\r\nchildren and heirs brought the matter before the court, and refused\r\nto fulfil this obligation on account of Estevan Rodriguez's death. In\r\norder not to lose time, for what had been commenced had to be continued\r\nin one way or another, the governor decided to prosecute it, drawing\r\nthe necessary funds from the royal treasury, either on its own account\r\nor on the account of Estevan Rodriguez's heirs, if such should be\r\naccording to law. The governor then searched for a person to go to\r\nMindanao, and selected Don Juan Ronquillo, general of the galleys. The\r\nlatter was given the necessary reënforcements of men and other things,\r\nwith which he reached Mindanao. He took command of the Spanish camp and\r\nfleet which he found in Tampacan. He confirmed the peace and friendship\r\nwith the chiefs and people of Tampacan and Lumaguan, restored and set\r\nin better order the Spanish settlement and fort, and began to make\r\npreparation for the war against the people of Buhahayen. He spent\r\nmany days in making a few incursions into their land and attacks on\r\ntheir forts, but without any notable result, for the enemy were many\r\nand all good soldiers, with plenty of arquebuses [63] and artillery,\r\nand had fortified themselves in a strong position. They had many other\r\nfortifications inland and went from one to the other with impunity,\r\nwhenever they wished, and greatly harassed the Spaniards, who were\r\nlittle used to so swampy a country. The latter found themselves short\r\nof provisions without the possibility of getting them in the country\r\non account of the war, inasmuch as the camp contained many men,\r\nboth Spaniards and the native servants and boatmen, and it was not\r\neasy at all times to come and go from one part to another in order\r\nto provide necessities. [64]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Juan Ronquillo, seeing that the war was advancing very\r\nslowly and with little result, and that the camp was suffering, drew up\r\na report of it, and sent letters in all haste to Governor Don Francisco\r\nTello, informing him of the condition of affairs. He wrote that it\r\nwould be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao River, so that\r\nit might not perish; and that a presidio could be established on the\r\nsame island in the port of La Caldera, which could be left fortified,\r\nin order not to abandon this enterprise entirely, and so that their\r\nfriends of Tampacan and Lumaguan might be kept hostile to the people\r\nof Buhahayen. Meanwhile he and the rest of the camp and fleet would\r\nreturn to Manila, if permitted, for which he requested the governor\r\nto send him an order quickly. Upon the receipt of this despatch,\r\nGovernor Don Francisco Tello resolved to order Don Juan Ronquillo,\r\nsince the above was so and the camp could not be maintained, nor the\r\nwar continued advantageously, to withdraw with his whole camp from\r\nMindanao River. He was first to make a great effort to chastise the\r\nenemy in Buhahayen, and then to burn the Spanish settlement and fort\r\nand to go to La Caldera, fortify it, and leave there a sufficient\r\ngarrison with artillery, boats, and provisions for its maintenance and\r\nservice. Then he was to return to Manila with the rest of his men,\r\nafter telling their friends in Tampacan that the Spaniards would\r\nshortly return to the river better equipped and in greater numbers.\r\n\r\nSilonga and other chiefs of Buhahayen were not neglecting their\r\ndefense, since, among other measures taken, they had sent a chief to\r\nTerrenate to ask assistance against the Spaniards who had brought\r\nwar into their homes. Thereupon the king of Terrenate despatched a\r\nnumerous fleet of caracoas and other boats to Mindanao with cachils\r\n[65] and valiant soldiers--more than one thousand fighting men in\r\nall--and a quantity of small artillery, in order to force the Spaniards\r\nto break camp and depart, even could they do nothing else. When the\r\nnews reached Buhahayen that this fleet was coming to their defense and\r\nsupport, they made ready and prepared to attack the Spaniards, who\r\nalso having heard the same news were not careless. Consequently the\r\nlatter turned their attention more to the main fort, and reduced the\r\nnumber of men in the smaller forts on Buquil River and other posts,\r\nmouths, and arms of the same river. These served to strengthen the\r\ngarrison of the main fort and the armed galleys and other smaller\r\ncraft, in order to use the latter to resist the expected attack of\r\nthe enemy. The enemy having gallantly advanced to the very fort of\r\nthe Spaniards with all their vessels and men, attacked and stormed it\r\nwith great courage and resolution, in order to effect an entrance. The\r\nSpaniards within resisted valiantly, and those outside in the galleys\r\non the river assisted them so effectively that together, with artillery\r\nand arquebuses, and at times in close combat with swords and campilans,\r\nthey made a great slaughter and havoc among the men of Terrenate and\r\nthose of Buhahayen, who were aiding the former. They killed and wounded\r\na great number of them and captured almost all the caracoas and vessels\r\nof the enemy, so that very few boats escaped and they were pursued and\r\nburned by the Spaniards, who made many prisoners, and seized immense\r\nbooty and many weapons from the enemy. As soon as possible after this,\r\nthe Spaniards turned against the settlements and forts of Buhahayen\r\nwhere some of their results were of so great moment that the enemy,\r\nseeing themselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them, sent\r\nmessages and proposals of peace to Don Juan Ronquillo, which were\r\nended by their rendering recognition and homage, and the renewal\r\nof friendship with the people of Tampacan, their ancient enemy. In\r\norder to strengthen the friendship, they sealed it by the marriage\r\nof the greatest chief and lord of Buhahayen with the daughter of\r\nanother chief of Tampacan, called Dongonlibor. Thereupon the war was\r\napparently completely ended, provisions were now to be had, and the\r\nSpaniards with little precaution crossed and went about the country\r\nwherever they wished. The people of Buhahayen promised to dismantle\r\nall their forts immediately, for that was one of the conditions of\r\npeace. Then the Spaniards returned to their fort and settlement at\r\nTampacan, whence Don Juan Ronquillo immediately sent despatches to\r\nGovernor Don Francisco Tello, informing him of the different turn\r\nthat the enterprise had taken. In view of the present condition he\r\nrequested the governor to issue new instructions as to his procedure,\r\nsaying that he would wait without making any change, notwithstanding\r\nthe arrival of the answer which he expected to his first report,\r\nfor conditions had now become so much better than before that the\r\ngovernor's decision would be different.\r\n\r\nThe governor had already answered Don Joan Ronquillo's first despatch,\r\nas we have said above, when the second despatch arrived with news\r\nof the successes in Mindanao. Suspicious of the men in the camp who\r\nhad constantly shown a desire to return to Manila, and little relish\r\nfor the hardships of war, and fearing lest they would return at the\r\narrival of the first order, executing that order and abandoning the\r\nenterprise which had reached such a satisfactory stage; and thinking\r\nthat it would be unwise to abandon the river: the governor made haste\r\nto send a second despatch immediately by various roads, ordering them\r\nto pay no attention to his first orders, but to remain in Mindanao, and\r\nthat he would soon send them what was necessary for further operations.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this message traveled slowly; for, the first having\r\narrived, they obeyed it without any further delay, and camp was\r\nraised and the country abandoned. To their former enemy of Buhahayen\r\nthey gave as a reason that the governor of Manila had summoned them;\r\nand to their friends of Tampacan, they said that they would leave men\r\nin La Caldera for their security, and that assistance would be sent\r\nthem from Manila. This news caused as much sorrow and sadness to the\r\nlatter, as joy to the people of Buhahayen. Then after burning their\r\nfort and settlement, the Spaniards embarked all their forces as soon as\r\npossible, left the river, and went to La Caldera, twenty-four leguas\r\nfarther down in the direction of Manila. Having entered port, they\r\nbuilt a fortress and left there a garrison of one hundred Spaniards,\r\nwith some artillery, provisions, and boats for their use.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the governor's second message to General Don Joan\r\nRonquillo arrived, to which the latter replied that he was already\r\nin La Caldera, and could not return to the river. Then, without any\r\nfurther delay, Don Juan Ronquillo went to Manila with the balance of\r\nhis fleet, by way of the provinces of Oton, and Panay. The governor,\r\nhaving heard of his coming, sent to arrest him on the road before\r\nhe entered the city, and proceeded against him by law for having\r\nwithdrawn the camp and army from Mindanao River, without awaiting the\r\norders he should have expected after the favorable turn that affairs\r\nhad taken. Don Juan Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private\r\nletter from the governor, which the latter had sent him separately\r\nwith the first instructions, to the effect that he should return\r\nto Manila with his troops in any event, for they were needed in the\r\nislands for other purposes; and because of this letter Don Juan had\r\ndetermined not to await the second order.\r\n\r\nCaptain and Sargento-mayor Gallinato crossed from Cochinchina to Manila\r\nin the flagship of his fleet, and informed Don Francisco Tello whom he\r\nfound governing, of the events of his expedition; and that Blas Ruyz\r\nand Diego Belloso had gone by land to Lao from Cochinchina in search\r\nof King Langara of Camboja. Thus by their absence he avoided the blame\r\nof leaving Camboja, although there were not wanting many of his own\r\nfollowers who angrily gave information of the opportunity that he had\r\nlost by not showing himself or staying in Camboja when he had so good\r\nan opportunity; and they stoutly asserted that if he had done so,\r\nall that had been hoped in that kingdom would have been attained.\r\n\r\nThe other ship of his convoy, to which the balance of his fleet\r\nhad been reduced, of which he made Alférez Luys Ortiz commander,\r\ncould not pursue the voyage on account of heavy storms, and put in at\r\nMalaca. Some of the Spaniards remained there, and Ortiz with the rest\r\nof the crew, was able to set sail after a few months, and returned\r\nto Manila.\r\n\r\nCoincident with the above, and at the beginning of Don Francisco\r\nTello's administration, two Indian chiefs of the province of Cagayan,\r\nthe more powerful of whom was called Magalat, were detained in Manila,\r\nbecause they, with their kinsmen, and others who followed their\r\nparty and opinion, often incited the settlements of that province to\r\nrebellion; and it had cost no little trouble to subdue them; besides\r\nthe daily murder of many Spaniards and other injuries inflicted upon\r\nthe peaceful natives and their crops. Magalat was captain and leader\r\nof these men, and since he, with his brother and other natives, was\r\nin Manila, and unable to leave it, that province became more secure.\r\n\r\nSome Dominican religious bound for Segovia, the capital of that\r\nprovince, where they give instruction, moved with pity, persuaded\r\nthe governor to let Magalat and his brother return to their country\r\nwith them. To such an extent did they importune the governor, that\r\nhe granted their request. Having reached Cagayan, the chiefs went\r\ninland by the Lobo River and again incited the whole country to\r\nrebellion. With the help of other chiefs of Tubigarao, and other\r\nsettlements, they so stirred up things, that it was impossible to\r\ngo to those settlements or a step beyond the city. Magalat was the\r\nleader of the rebels, and he committed cruel murders and injuries\r\neven upon the natives themselves, if they refused to rise against the\r\nSpaniards. This reached such a point that the governor was obliged\r\nto send the master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves, from Manila with\r\ntroops, in order that he might suitably remedy the evil. In spite\r\nof many difficulties, the latter had so good fortune that he seized\r\nmany insurgent leaders upon whom he executed justice and public\r\npunishment. As for Magalat himself, the governor caused him to be\r\nkilled in his own house and land where he had fortified himself, by\r\nthe hand of his own Indians, who had offered to do it for a reward;\r\nfor in no other way did it appear possible. Had Magalat not been\r\nkilled, the war would have dragged on for many years, but with his\r\ndeath the province became quiet and the peace secure.\r\n\r\nIn April of the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-five,\r\nAdelantado Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira sailed from Callao de Lima in\r\nPeru, to colonize the Salomon Islands, which he had discovered many\r\nyears before in the South Sea, [66] the principal one of which he had\r\ncalled San Christoval. He took four ships, two large ones--a flagship\r\nand an almiranta--a frigate, and a galliot, with four hundred men\r\nin all. He was also accompanied by his wife, Doña Ysabel Barreto and\r\nhis three brothers-in-law. On the way he discovered other islands at\r\nwhich he did not stop; but not finding those which he had previously\r\ndiscovered, and as his almiranta had been lost, he anchored with the\r\nother ships at an island near Nueva Guinea, inhabited by blacks,\r\nto which he gave the name of Santa Cruz [Holy Cross]. There he\r\nsettled--little to the satisfaction of his men. The adelantado, two of\r\nhis brothers-in-law, and many of his people died there. Doña Ysabel\r\nBarreto abandoned the colony, on account of sickness and want, and\r\nembarked the survivors aboard her flagship, frigate, and galliot. But\r\nwhile they were sailing toward the Filipinas the frigate and galliot\r\ndisappeared in another direction. The flagship entered the river of\r\nButuan, in the island of Mindanao, and reached Manila after great\r\nwant and suffering. There Doña Ysabel Barreto married Don Fernando de\r\nCastro, and returned to Nueva España in his ship, the \"San Geronymo,\"\r\nin the year ninety-six. The events of this voyage have been only\r\nlightly touched upon here, so that it seems fitting to reproduce\r\nliterally the relation, to which Don Pedro Fernandez de Quiros,\r\nchief pilot on this voyage, affixed his signature, which is as follows.\r\n\r\nRelation of the voyage of Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira for\r\nthe discovery of the Salomon Islands\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the ninth of the month of April, one thousand five hundred\r\nand ninety-five, Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña set sail with his fleet\r\nfor the conquest and settlement of the western islands in the South\r\nSea, sailing from the port of Callao de Lima, which lies in twelve and\r\none-half degrees south latitude. Laying his course toward the valleys\r\nof Santa, Truxillo, and Saña, and collecting men and provisions, he\r\nwent to Paita. [67] There he took in water and numbered his forces,\r\nwhich amounted to about four hundred persons. Then with his four\r\nvessels,  two large and two small, he left the said port, which is\r\nfive degrees higher than the former port, and directed his course\r\nwest-southwest in search of the islands that he had discovered. He\r\ntook Pedro Merino Manrique as master-of-camp; his brother-in-law,\r\nLope de la Vega, as admiral; and Pedro Fernandez de Quiros as\r\nchief pilot. Following the above-mentioned course he sailed to the\r\naltitude of nine and one-half degrees, whence he sailed southwest by\r\nwest to fourteen degrees, where he changed his course to northwest\r\nby west. On Friday, the twenty-first of the month of July, having\r\nreached an altitude of ten long degrees, we sighted an island to\r\nwhich the general gave the name of Madalena. [68] From a port of this\r\nisland, about seventy canoes came out, each containing three men,\r\nor thereabout, while some came swimming and others on logs. There\r\nwere more than four hundred Indians, white and of a very agreeable\r\nappearance, tall and strong, large-limbed, and so well made that\r\nthey by far surpassed us. [69] They had fine teeth, eyes, mouth,\r\nhands and feet, and beautiful long flowing hair, while many of them\r\nwere very fair. Very handsome youths were to be seen among them;\r\nall were naked and covered no part. Their bodies, legs, arms, hands,\r\nand even some of their faces, were all marked after the fashion of\r\nthese Bissayans. And indeed, for a barbarous people, naked, and of\r\nso little reason, one could not restrain himself, at sight of them,\r\nfrom thanking God for having created them. And do not think this\r\nexaggeration, for it was so. These people invited us to their port,\r\nand were in turn invited to our flagship, and about forty of them\r\ncame aboard. In comparison with them we appeared to be men of less\r\nthan ordinary size. Among them was one who was thought to be a palmo\r\ntaller than the tallest man of our fleet, although we had in the\r\nfleet men of more than average height. The general gave some of them\r\nshirts and other things, which they accepted with much pleasure,\r\ndancing after their fashion and calling others. But being annoyed\r\nat the liberties that they took, for they were great thieves, the\r\ngeneral had a cannon fired, in order to frighten them. When they\r\nheard it they all swam ashore, seized their weapons, and at the sound\r\nof a conch threw a few stones at the ships and threatened us with\r\ntheir lances, for they had no other weapons. Our men fired their\r\narquebuses at them from the ships and killed five or six of them,\r\nwhereat they stopped. Our fleet sailed on and we discovered three\r\nother islands. This island has a circumference of about six leguas. We\r\npassed it on its southern side. On that side it is high and slopes\r\nprecipitously to the sea, and has mountainous ravines where the\r\nIndians dwell. There seemed to be many inhabitants, for we saw them\r\non the rocks and on the beach. And so we continued our course to the\r\nother three islands. The first, to which was given the name San Pedro,\r\nis about ten leguas from Magdalena, and like it extends northwest by\r\nnorth. It has a circumference of about three leguas. The island is\r\nbeautiful, and rich in woods and fine fields. We did not ascertain\r\nwhether it was inhabited or not, for we did not stop there. To the\r\nsoutheast and about five leguas from it lies another island to which\r\nthe general gave the name of Dominica. It is very sightly, and to\r\nall appearances thickly populated, and has a circumference of about\r\nfifteen leguas. To the south and a little more than one legua from\r\nit lies another island with a circumference of about eight leguas,\r\nwhich received the name of Sancta Cristina. Our fleet passed through\r\nthe channel that separates the one island from the other, for all that\r\nwe saw of these islands is clear sailing. On the west side of Sancta\r\nCristina, a good port was found, and there the fleet anchored. [70]\r\nThese Indians did not seem to me to resemble the first; but many\r\nbeautiful women were seen. I did not see the latter, but some who did\r\nassured me that in their opinion, they are as beautiful as the women\r\nin Lima, but light complexioned and not so tall--and the women in Lima\r\nare very beautiful. The articles of food seen in that port were swine\r\nand fowl, sugar-cane, excellent bananas, cocoanuts, and a fruit that\r\ngrows on high trees. Each of the last is as large as a good-sized\r\npineapple, and is excellent eating. Much of it was eaten green,\r\nroasted, and boiled. When ripe it is indeed so sweet and good that,\r\nin my estimation, there is no other that surpasses it. Scarcely any\r\nof it, except a little husk, has to be thrown away. [71] There was\r\nalso another fruit with a flavor like that of chestnuts, but much\r\nlarger in size than six chestnuts put together; much of this fruit\r\nwas eaten roasted and boiled. Certain nuts with a very hard shell,\r\nand very oily, were also found, which were eaten in great quantities,\r\nand which, according to some, induced diarrhoea. We also saw some\r\nCastilian pumpkins growing. Near the beach there is a fine cascade\r\nof very clear water, which issues from a rock at the height of two\r\nmen. Its volume is about the width of four or five fingers. Then\r\nnear by there is a stream, from which the boats drew a full supply\r\nof water. The Indians fled to the forests and rocks, where they\r\nfortified themselves and tried to do some mischief, by throwing\r\nstones and rolling down rocks, but they never wounded anyone, for\r\nthe master-of-camp restrained them, by placing outposts. The Indians\r\nof this island, on seeing one of our negroes, made signs toward the\r\nsouth, saying that there were men like him there, and that they were\r\nwont to go there to fight; that the others were armed with arrows; and\r\nthat they make the journey thither in certain large canoes which they\r\npossess. Since there was no interpreter, or much curiosity to learn\r\nmore, no further investigations were made, although, in my opinion,\r\nthis is impossible for Indians so remote, unless there be a chain of\r\nislands; for their boats and their customs in other things show that\r\nthey have not come from any great distance.\r\n\r\nThis port lies in an altitude of nine and one-half degrees. The\r\nadelantado ordered three crosses to be planted, and on Saturday, August\r\nfifth, to weigh anchor and set sail southwest by west. We sailed with\r\neasterly and east southeasterly winds, now southwest by west and now\r\nnorthwest by west, for about four hundred leguas. One Sunday, August\r\ntwenty, we sighted four low islands with sandy beaches, abounding\r\nin palms and other trees. On the southeast side, towards the north,\r\nwas seen a great sandbank. All four islands have a circuit of about\r\ntwelve leguas. Whether they were inhabited or not, we could not tell,\r\nfor we did not go to them. That year appeared to be one of talk, of\r\nwhich I speak with anger. These islands lie in an altitude of ten and\r\nthree-quarters degrees. They were named San Bernardo, [72] because\r\nthey were discovered on that saint's day. Thenceforward we began to\r\nmeet southeasterly winds, which never failed us, and which seem to\r\nprevail in those regions. With these winds we continued to sail always\r\nin the said direction, never going above eleven or below ten degrees,\r\nuntil Tuesday, August twenty-nine, when we discovered a round islet,\r\nof about one legua in circumference, surrounded by reefs. We tried\r\nto land there, so that the almiranta could take on wood and water, of\r\nwhich there was great need, but could find no landing-place. We gave\r\nit the name of La Solitaria [Solitary Island]. It lies in an altitude\r\nof ten and two-thirds degrees, and is about one thousand five hundred\r\nand thirty five leguas from Lima. [73] From this island we continued\r\nto sail in the said course: a thing which drew a variety of opinions\r\nfrom the men, some saying that we did not know where we were going,\r\nand other things which did not fail to cause some hard feelings; but by\r\nthe mercy of God, at midnight on the eve of Nuestra Señora de Setiembre\r\n[Our Lady of September], we sighted an island of about ninety or one\r\nhundred leguas in circumference, which extends almost east southeast\r\nand west northwest, and lies about one thousand eight hundred leguas\r\nfrom Lima. [74] The whole island is full of dense forests, even to\r\nthe highest ridges; and where it was not cleared for the Indians'\r\nfields, not a palmo of earth could be seen. The ships anchored in a\r\nport on the north side of the island, in ten degrees of latitude. About\r\nseven leguas north of that port, there is a volcano with a very well\r\nshaped cone, which ejects much fire from its summit, and from other\r\nparts. The volcano is high and about three leguas in circumference. On\r\nthe side toward the sea it is very steep and quite bare, and offers\r\nno landing; and it rumbles frequently and loudly within. Northeast of\r\nthis volcano are several small inhabited islets, surrounded by many\r\nshoals. The distance to these islets is seven or eight leguas. The\r\nshoals extend about northwest, and one who saw them said that they\r\nwere numerous. Around the large island were several small ones, and\r\nas we sailed around them, we found that they were all inhabited,\r\neven the large one. Within sight of this large island, and to the\r\nsoutheast of it, we saw another island of no great size. This must\r\nbe the connecting link with the other islands. [75] After having put\r\ninto port at the great island Sancta Cruz, as it had been named, the\r\nadelantado ordered Captain Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, to go with\r\nthe frigate in search of the almiranta, of which I have no favorable\r\nconjectures, and which had disappeared on the night that we sighted the\r\nisland. It was sought on this and on two other occasions, but nothing\r\nexcept the shoals above-mentioned were found. What was seen in the\r\nway of food in this bay and port was swine, fowl, bananas, sugar-cane,\r\nsome two or three kinds of roots resembling sweet potatoes, which are\r\neaten boiled or roasted and made into biscuits, buyos [i.e., betel],\r\ntwo kinds of excellent almonds, two kinds of pine-nuts, ring-doves\r\nand turtle-doves, ducks, gray and white herons, swallows, a great\r\nquantity of amaranth, Castilian pumpkins, the fruit which I mentioned\r\nas being in the first islands, chestnuts, and walnuts. Sweet basil,\r\nof great fragrance, and red flowers, which are kept in the gardens\r\nat that port, and two other kinds of different flowers, also red, are\r\nfound. There is another fruit which grows on high trees, and resembles\r\nthe pippin in its pleasing smell and savor; a great quantity of ginger\r\ngrows wild there, as also of the herb chiquilite, from which indigo\r\nis made. [76] There are agave-trees, abundance of sagia [sago (?)],\r\n[77] and many cocoanuts. Marble is also to be seen, as well as pearl\r\nshells and large snail-shells, like those brought from China. There is\r\na very copious spring and five or six rivers of small volume. There\r\nwe settled close by the spring. The Indians endeavored to prevent\r\nus; but as the arquebus tells at a distance, upon seeing its deadly\r\neffects, their hostility was lukewarm, and they even gave us some of\r\nthe things that they possessed. In this matter of procuring provisions,\r\nseveral cases of not over good treatment happened to the Indians; for\r\nthe Indian who was our best friend and lord of that island, Malope\r\nby name, was killed, as well as two or three others, also friendly\r\nto us. No more of all the island than about three leguas about the\r\ncamp was explored. The people of this island are black. They have\r\nsmall single-masted canoes for use about their villages; and some\r\nvery large ones to use in the open sea. On Sunday, October eight, the\r\nadelantado had the master-of-camp stabbed. Tomas de Ampuero was also\r\nkilled in the same way. Alférez Juan de Buitrago was beheaded; and the\r\nadelantado intended to have two others, friends of the master-of-camp,\r\nkilled, but was restrained therefrom at our request. The cause of\r\nthis was notorious, for these men tried to induce the adelantado to\r\nleave the land and abandon it. There must have been other reasons\r\nunknown to me; what I saw was much dissoluteness and shamelessness,\r\nand a great deal of improper conduct. On October eighteen, after a\r\ntotal eclipse of the moon on the seventeenth, the adelantado died;\r\n[78] November two, Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, who had succeeded\r\nhim as captain-general; the priest Antonio de Serpa, seven or eight\r\ndays before; and November eight the vicar, Juan de Espinosa. Disease\r\nwas rampant among our men and many died for lack of care, and the\r\nwant of an apothecary and doctor. The men begged the governor Doña\r\nYsabel Barreto to take them out of the country. All agreed to embark,\r\nand by the mercy of God, we left this port on Saturday, the eighteenth\r\nof the said month, and sailed southwest by west toward the island of\r\nSan Cristoval or rather in search of it, to see whether we could find\r\nit or the almiranta, in accordance with the governor's orders. For two\r\ndays nothing was seen; and at the request of all the men, who cried\r\nout that we were taking them to destruction, she ordered me to steer\r\nfrom our settlement, located in ten and one-half degrees of latitude,\r\nto Manila. Thence I steered north northwest to avoid meeting islands\r\non the way, since we were so ill prepared to approach any of them,\r\nwith our men so sick that about fifty of them died in the course of\r\nthe voyage and about forty there in the island. We continued our course\r\nshort of provisions, navigating five degrees south and as many north,\r\nand meeting with many contrary winds and calms. When we reached an\r\naltitude of six long degrees north latitude, we sighted an island,\r\napparently about twenty-five leguas in circumference, thickly wooded\r\nand inhabited by many people who resembled those of the Ladrones,\r\nand whom we saw coming toward us in canoes. From the southeast\r\nto the north and then to the southwest, it is surrounded by large\r\nreefs. [79] About four leguas west of it are some low islets. There,\r\nalthough we tried, we failed to find a suitable place to anchor; for\r\nthe galliot and frigates which accompanied our ship had disappeared\r\nsome days before. [80] From this place we continued the said course\r\nuntil we reached an altitude of thirteen and three-quarters degrees,\r\nand in the two days that we sailed west in this latitude, we sighted\r\nthe islands of Serpana [i.e., Seypan] and Guan in the Ladrones. We\r\npassed between the two and did not anchor there, because we had no\r\ncable for lowering and hauling up the boat. This was the third of the\r\nmonth of January, one thousand five hundred and ninety-six. On the\r\nfourteenth of the same month we sighted the cape of Espiritu Sancto,\r\nand on the fifteenth we anchored in the bay of Cobos. [81] We reached\r\nthere in such a state that only the goodness of God could have taken\r\nus thither; for human strength and resources would hardly have taken\r\nus a tenth of the way. We reached that place so dismantled and the\r\ncrew so weak that we were a most piteous sight, and with only nine\r\nor ten jars of water. In this bay of Cobos the ship was repaired and\r\nthe men recuperated as much as possible. On Tuesday, February second,\r\nwe left the above port and bay, and on the tenth of the same month\r\nwe anchored in the port of Cabite, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides my desire to serve your Grace, I am moved to leave this brief\r\nrelation for you, by the fact that if, perchance, God should dispose of\r\nmy life, or other events should cause me or the relation that I carry\r\nto disappear, the truth may be learned from this one, which may prove\r\na matter of great service to God and to the king our sovereign. [82]\r\nWill your Grace look favorably upon my great desire to serve you,\r\nof which I shall give a better proof, if God permit me to return to\r\nthis port. Will your Grace also pardon my brevity, since the fault\r\nlies in the short time at my present disposal. Moreover, since no man\r\nknows what time may bring, I beg your Grace to keep the matter secret,\r\nfor on considering it well, it seems only right that nothing be said\r\nabout the first islands until his Majesty be informed and order what\r\nis convenient to his service, for, as the islands occupy a position\r\nmidway between Peru, Nueva Españia, and this land, the English,\r\non learning of them, might settle them and do much mischief in this\r\nsea. Your Grace, I consider myself as the faithful servant of your\r\nGrace. May God our Lord preserve you for many years in great joy and\r\nincreasing prosperity, etc. Your Grace's servant, PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE\r\nQUIROS To Doctor Antonio de Morga, lieutenant-governor of his Majesty\r\nin the Filipinas.\r\n\r\n When Governor Don Francisco Tello entered upon his office, in the\r\nyear ninety-six, he found the \"San Geronymo,\" the ship in which Don\r\nFernando de Castro and his wife Doña Ysabel Barreto were returning\r\nto Nueva España, preparing for the voyage in the port of Cabite. He\r\nalso found there the galleon \"San Felipe\" laden with Filipinas goods,\r\npreparing to make its voyage to Nueva España. As soon as Governor\r\nDon Francisco Tello entered upon his administration, both ships were\r\ndespatched and set sail. Although the \"San Geronymo\" sailed last,\r\nit made the voyage, reaching Nueva Españia at the end of the said\r\nyear of ninety-six. The vessel \"San Felipe,\" which was a large ship\r\nand heavily laden with merchandise and passengers, and whose commander\r\nand general was Don Mathia de Landecho, encountered many storms on the\r\nvoyage, so that at one time it became necessary to throw considerable\r\ncargo overboard, and they lost their rudder while in thirty-seven\r\ndegrees of latitude, six hundred leguas from the Filipinas, and a\r\nhundred and fifty from Xapon. Seeing themselves unable to continue\r\ntheir voyage, it was decided to put back to the Filipinas. They set\r\nabout this and changed their course, but experienced even greater\r\ndifficulties and trials. Many times they gave themselves up as lost,\r\nfor the seas ran high, and as the vessel had no rudder, the rigging\r\nand few sails were carried away, and blown into shreds. They could not\r\nhold the vessel to its course, and it worked so often to windward that\r\nthey were in great danger of foundering, and lost all hope of reaching\r\nthe Filipinas. Xapon was the nearest place, but not sufficiently near\r\nto enable them to reach it or to venture near its coast which is very\r\nwild, and unknown to them even by sight; and even should they have the\r\ngood fortune to reach it, they did not know how the Japanese would\r\nreceive them. At this juncture arose confusion and a diversity of\r\nopinion among the men aboard. Some said that they should not abandon\r\nthe course to Manila, in spite of the great peril and discomfort that\r\nthey were experiencing. Others said that it would be a rash act to do\r\nso, and that, since Xapon was much nearer, they should make for it,\r\nand look for the port of Nangasaqui, between which and the Filipinas\r\ntrade was carried on. There they would be well received and would find\r\nmeans to repair their ships, and of resuming the voyage thence. This\r\nopinion prevailed, for some religious in the ship adopted it, and the\r\nrest coincided with them, on the assurance of the pilots that they\r\nwould quickly take the ship to Xapon. Accordingly they altered their\r\ncourse for that country, and after six days sighted the coast and\r\ncountry of Xapon, at a province called Toça; [83] and although they\r\ntried by day to reach the land, at night, when they lowered the sails,\r\nthe tide carried them away from it. Many funeas [84] came to the ship\r\nfrom a port called Hurando, and the Spaniards, persuaded by the king\r\nof that province, who assured them of harbor, tackle, and repairs,\r\nentered the port, after having sounded and examined the entrance, and\r\nwhether the water was deep enough. The Japanese, who were faithless,\r\nand did this with evil intent, towed the ship into the port, leading\r\nand guiding it onto a shoal, where, for lack of water, it touched and\r\ngrounded. Therefore the Spaniards were obliged to unload the ship and\r\ntake all the cargo ashore close to the town, to a stockade which was\r\ngiven them for that purpose. For the time being the Japanese gave the\r\nSpaniards a good reception, but as to repairing the ship and leaving\r\nport again, the latter were given to understand that it could not be\r\ndone without permission and license from Taicosama, the sovereign of\r\nJapon, who was at his court in Miaco, one hundred leguas from that\r\nport. General Don Matia de Landecho and his companions, in order\r\nto lose no time, resolved to send their ambassadors to court with a\r\nvaluable gift from the ship's cargo for Taicosama, to beg him to order\r\ntheir departure. They sent on this mission Christoval de Mercado,\r\nthree other Spaniards, Fray Juan Pobre, of the Franciscan order,\r\nand Fray Juan Tamayo, of the Augustinian order, who were aboard the\r\nvessel. They were to confer concerning this affair with Taico in Miaco,\r\nand were to avail themselves of the Franciscan fathers who were in\r\nMiaco. The latter had gone as ambassadors from the Filipinas to settle\r\nmatters between Xapon and Manila, and were residing at court in a\r\npermanent house and hospital, with Taico's sufferance. There they were\r\nmaking a few converts, although with considerable opposition from the\r\nreligious of the Society of Jesus established in the same kingdom. The\r\nlatter asserted other religious to be forbidden by apostolic briefs and\r\nroyal decrees to undertake or engage in the conversion of Japon. The\r\nking of Hurando, although to all appearances friendly and kind to\r\nthe Spaniards in his port, took great care to keep them and their\r\nmerchandise secure. He immediately sent word to court that that ship of\r\nforeigners called Nambajies [85] had been wrecked there, and that the\r\nSpaniards had brought great riches. This kindled Taicosama's greed,\r\nwho, in order to get possession of them, sent Ximonojo, one of his\r\nfavorites and a member of his council, to Hurando. Ximonojo, upon his\r\narrival, took possession of all the merchandise, and imprisoned the\r\nSpaniards within a well-guarded palisade, after having forced them to\r\ngive up all their possessions and what they had hid, under pain of\r\ndeath. Having exercised great rigor therein, he returned to court,\r\n after granting permission to the general and others of his suite to go\r\n to Miaco. The ambassadors who had been sent before to Miaco with the\r\n present, were unable to see Taico, although the present was accepted;\r\n nor did they succeed in making any profitable arrangement, although\r\n father Fray Pedro Baptista, superior of the Franciscan religious\r\n residing there, employed many methods for the purpose of remedying the\r\n grievance of the Spaniards. These attempts only served to intensify\r\n the evil; for the favorites, who were infidels and hated the religious\r\n for making converts at court, on seeing Taico so bent upon the riches\r\n of the ship and so unwilling to listen to any restitution, not only\r\n did not ask him to do so, but in order to make the matter easier, and\r\n taking advantage of the occasion, set Taicosama against the Spaniards;\r\n telling him that the religious and the men from the ship were all\r\n subjects of one sovereign, and conquerors of others' kingdoms. They\r\n said that the Spaniards did this by first sending their religious\r\n to the kingdoms, and then entered after with their arms, and that\r\n they would do this with Xapon. They were aided in this purpose by\r\n the fact that when the favorite, who went to seize the property of\r\n the ship, was in Hurando, its pilot, Francisco de Sanda, had shown\r\n him the sea-chart in which could be seen all the countries which had\r\n been discovered, and España and the other kingdoms possessed by his\r\n Majesty, among which were Piru and Nueva España. When the favorite\r\n asked how those distant kingdoms had been gained, the pilot replied\r\n that the religious had entered first and preached their religion,\r\n and then the soldiers had followed and subdued them. It is true that\r\n the said pilot imprudently gave those reasons, which Ximonojo noted\r\n well and kept in mind, in order to relate them to Taicosama whenever\r\n a suitable opportunity should present itself, which he now did.\r\n\r\nAll this, together with the persistency with which the religious begged\r\nTaico to restore the merchandise to the Spaniards, resulted in angering\r\nhim thoroughly, and like the barbarous and so avaricious tyrant that\r\nhe was, he gave orders to crucify them all and all the religious\r\nwho preached the religion of Namban  [86] in his kingdoms. Five\r\nreligious who were in the house at Miaco were immediately seized,\r\ntogether with another from the \"San Felipe\" who had joined them, and\r\nall the Japanese preachers and teachers. [87] It was also understood\r\nthat the persecution would extend to the other orders and Christians\r\nin Japon, whereupon all received great fear and confusion. But later\r\nTaico's wrath was moderated, for, allowing himself to be entreated,\r\nhe declared that only the religious who had been found in the house\r\nat Miaco, and their companions, the Japanese preachers and teachers,\r\nwho were arrested, would be crucified; and that all the others,\r\ntogether with the Spaniards of the ship, would be allowed to return\r\nto Manila. Fonzanbrandono, brother of Taracabadono, governor of\r\nNangasaqui, was entrusted with the execution of the order. He placed\r\nall those who were taken from the house of the Franciscan religious at\r\nMiaco on ox-carts, under a strong guard; namely, Fray Pedro Baptista,\r\nFray Martin de Aguirre, Fray Felipe de las Casas, Fray Gonçalo,\r\nFray Francisco Blanco, Fray Francisco de San Miguel, and twenty-six\r\n[sic] Japanese preachers and teachers with two boys who were in the\r\nservice of the religious. Their right ears were cut off, and they were\r\nparaded through the streets of Miaco and through those of the cities\r\nof Fugimen, Usaca, and Sacai, [88] to the great grief and sorrow\r\nof all Christians who saw their sufferings. The sentence and cause\r\nof their martyrdom was written on a tablet in Chinese characters,\r\nwhich was carried hanging on a spear; and read as follows.\r\n\r\nSentence of the Combaco, [89] lord of Xapon, against the discalced\r\nreligious and their teachers, whom he has ordered to be martyred\r\nin Nangasaqui.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as these men came from the Luzones, from the island of Manila,\r\nin the capacity of ambassadors, and were allowed to remain in the city\r\nof Miaco, preaching the Christian religion, which in former years I\r\nhave strictly forbidden: I order that they be executed together with\r\nthe Japanese who embraced their religion. Therefore these twenty-four\r\n[sic] men will be crucified in the city of Nangasaqui. And whereas\r\nI again forbid the teaching of this religion henceforward: let all\r\nunderstand this. I command that this decree be carried out; and should\r\nany person dare to violate this order, he shall be punished together\r\nwith his whole family. Given on the first of Echo, and second of the\r\nmoon. [90]\r\n\r\nThus these holy men were taken to Nangasaqui. There, on a hill sown\r\nwith wheat, in sight of the town and port, and near a house and\r\nhospital called San Lazaro, established in Nangasaqui by the said\r\nreligious on their first coming from the Filipinas, before going\r\nup to the capital, they were all crucified in a row. The religious\r\nwere placed in the middle and the others on either side upon high\r\ncrosses, with iron staples at their throats, hands, and feet, and\r\nwith long, sharp iron lances thrust up from below and crosswise\r\nthrough their sides.  [91] Thus did they render their souls to their\r\nCreator for whom they died with great resolution, on the fifth of\r\nFebruary, day of St. Agueda, of the year one thousand five hundred and\r\nninety-seven. They left behind in that ploughed field, and through it\r\nin all that kingdom, a great quantity of seed sown, which they watered\r\nwith their blood, and from which we hope to gather abundant fruit of\r\na numerous conversion to our holy Catholic faith. Before these holy\r\nmen were crucified, they wrote a letter to Doctor Antonio de Morga,\r\nin Manila, by the hand of Fray Martin de Aguirre, which reads word\r\nfor word as follows.\r\n\r\nTo Doctor Morga, lieutenant-governor of Manila, whom may God protect,\r\netc., Manila.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Doctor! farewell! Our Lord, not regarding my sins, has,\r\nin His mercy, been pleased to make me one of a band of twenty-four\r\n[sic] servants of God, who are about to die for love of Him. Six of\r\nus are friars of St. Francis, and eighteen are native Japanese. With\r\nhopes that many more will follow in the same path, may your Grace\r\nreceive the last farewell and the last embraces of all this company,\r\nfor we all acknowledge the support which you have manifested toward\r\nthe affairs of this conversion. And now, in taking leave, we beg\r\nof you--and I especially--to make the protection of this field of\r\nChristendom the object of your special care. Since you are a father,\r\nand look with favor upon all things which may concern the mission of\r\nthe religious in this conversion, so may your Grace find one who will\r\nprotect and intercede for you before God in time of need. Farewell\r\nsir! Will your Grace give my last adieu to Doña Juana. May our Lord\r\npreserve, etc. From the road to execution, January twenty-eight,\r\none thousand five hundred and ninety-seven.\r\n\r\nThis king's greed has been much whetted by what he stole from the\r\n\"San Felipe.\" It is said that next year he will go to Luzon, and that\r\nhe does not go this year because of being busy with the Coreans. In\r\norder to gain his end, he intends to take the islands of Lequios [92]\r\nand Hermosa, throw forces from them into Cagayan, and thence to fall\r\nupon Manila, if God does not first put a stop to his advance. Your\r\nGraces will attend to what is fitting and necessary. [93]\r\n\r\nFRAY MARTIN DE LA ASCENCION\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the martyrs, although watched for many days by the\r\nJapanese, were removed by bits (especially those of the monks)\r\nfrom the crosses as relics by the Christians of the place, who very\r\nreverently distributed them around. Together with the staples and\r\nthe wood of the crosses they are now scattered throughout Christendom.\r\n\r\nTwo other religious of the same band, who were out of the house at\r\nthe time of the arrest, did not suffer this martyrdom. One, called\r\nFray Geronimo de Jesus,  [94] hid himself and went inland, in order\r\nnot to leave the country; the other, called Fray Agustin Rodriguez,\r\nwas sheltered by the fathers of the Society, who sent him away by way\r\nof Macan. General Don Mathia and the Spaniards of the ship, naked\r\nand stripped, left Japon. They embarked at Nangasaqui and went to\r\nManila in various ships which make that voyage for the Japanese and\r\nPortuguese. The first news of this event was learned from them in the\r\nmonth of May of ninety-seven. Great grief and sadness was caused by\r\nthe news, in the death of the holy religious, and in the disturbances\r\nwhich were expected to take place in future dealings between Japon\r\nand the Filipinas; as well as in the loss of the galleon and its\r\ncargo en route to Nueva España. The value of the vessel was over one\r\nmillion [pesos?], and caused great poverty among the Spaniards. After\r\nconsidering the advisable measures to take under the circumstances,\r\nit was ultimately decided that, in order not to allow the matter to\r\npass, a circumspect man should be sent to Japon with letters from the\r\ngovernor to Taicosama. The letters were to set forth the governor's\r\nanger at the taking of the ship and merchandise from the Spaniards,\r\nand at the killing of the religious; and were also to request Taicosama\r\nto make all the reparation possible, by restoring and returning the\r\nmerchandise to the Spaniards, and the artillery, tackle, and spoils of\r\nthe vessel that were left, as well as the bodies of the religious whom\r\nhe had crucified; and Taicosama was so to arrange matters thenceforth,\r\nthat Spaniards should not be so treated in his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe governor sent Don Luis Navarrete  [95] Fajardo as bearer of this\r\nmessage, and a present of some gold and silver ornaments, swords,\r\nand valuable cloth for Taicosama. He also sent him an elephant\r\nwell caparisoned and covered with silk, and with its naires [i.e.,\r\nelephant keepers] in the same livery, a thing never before seen in\r\nXapon. According to the custom of that kingdom, Don Luis was to make\r\nthe present to Taico when he presented his embassy, for the Japanese\r\nare wont to give or receive embassies in no other manner. When Don\r\nLuys de Navarrete reached Nangasaqui, Taicosama readily sent from\r\nthe court for the ambassador and for the present which had been sent\r\nhim from Luzon, for he was anxious to see the gifts, especially the\r\nelephant, with which he was greatly delighted. He heard the embassy\r\nand replied with much ostentation and display, exculpating himself\r\nfrom the death of the religious upon whom he laid the blame, saying\r\nthat after he had forbidden them to christianize, or teach their\r\nreligion, they had disregarded his orders in his own court. Likewise,\r\nthe seizure of the ship and its merchandise, which entered the port\r\nof Hurando in the province of Toza, had been a justifiable procedure,\r\naccording to the laws of Japon, because all ships lost on its coast\r\nbelong to the king, with their merchandise. Nevertheless, he added\r\nthat he was sorry for all that had happened, and that he would return\r\nthe merchandise had it not been distributed. As to the religious,\r\nthere was no remedy for it. But he begged the governor of Manila not\r\nto send such persons to Xapon, for he had again passed laws forbidding\r\nthe making of Christians under pain of death. He would deliver whatever\r\nhad remained of the bodies of the religious and would be glad to have\r\npeace and friendship with the Luzon Islands and the Spaniards, and\r\nfor his part, would endeavor to secure it. He said that if any other\r\nvessel came to his kingdom from Manila, he would give orders that it\r\nbe well received and well treated. With this reply and a letter of the\r\nsame purport for the governor, Don Luys Navarrete was dismissed. He\r\nwas given a present for the governor consisting of lances, armor, and\r\ncatans, considered rare and valuable by the Japanese. The ambassador\r\nthereupon left Miaco and went to Nangasaqui, whence by the first ship\r\nsailing to Manila, he sent word to Governor Don Francisco concerning\r\nhis negotiations. But the message itself was taken later to Manila\r\nby another person, on account of the illness and death of Don Luis in\r\nNangasaqui. Taicosama rejoiced over his answer to the ambassador, for\r\nhe had practically done nothing of what was asked of him. His reply\r\nwas more a display of dissembling and compliments than a desire for\r\nfriendship with the Spaniards. He boasted and published arrogantly,\r\nand his favorites said in the same manner, that the Spaniards had sent\r\nhim that present and embassy through fear, and as an acknowledgment\r\nof tribute and seigniory, so that he might not destroy them as he had\r\nthreatened them at other times in the past, when Gomez Perez Dasmariñas\r\nwas governor. And even then the Spaniards had sent him a message and\r\na present by Fray Juan Cobo, the Dominican, and Captain Llanos.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Faranda Quiemon sought war with Manila, and the favorites\r\nwho aided him did not neglect to beg Taico not to lose the opportunity\r\nof conquering that city. They said that it would be easy, since\r\nthere were but few Spaniards there; that a fleet could be sent there\r\nquickly, which Faranda would accompany. The latter assured Taico of\r\nsuccess, as one who knew the country and its resources. They urged\r\nhim so continually that Taico entrusted Faranda with the enterprise,\r\nand gave him some supplies and other assistance toward it. Faranda\r\nbegan to prepare ships and Chinese for the expedition, which he was\r\nnever able to carry out; for, being a man naturally low and poor,\r\nhe possessed neither the ability nor the means sufficient for the\r\nenterprise. His protectors themselves did not choose to assist him, and\r\nso his preparations were prolonged until the enterprise was abandoned\r\nat the death of Taico, and his own death, as will be stated later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile news was constantly reaching Manila that a fleet was being\r\nequipped in Japon, completely under the supervision of Faranda,\r\nand it naturally caused some anxiety among the people in spite of\r\ntheir courage and determination to resist him, for the enemy was\r\narrogant and powerful. Although the city was thoroughly resolved\r\nand determined to resist him, yet the governor and city would never\r\nshow openly that they were aware of the change which Taico was about\r\nto make, in order not to precipitate the war or give the other side\r\nany reason for hastening it. Trusting to time for the remedy, they so\r\ndisposed affairs in the city, that they might be ready for any future\r\nemergency. They sent the Japanese who had settled in Manila--and they\r\nwere not few--back to Xapon, and made those who came in merchant ships\r\ngive up their weapons until their return, which they endeavored to\r\nhasten as much as possible; but in all other respects, they treated\r\nthem hospitably. And because it was heard that Taico intended to take\r\npossession of the island of Hermosa, a well-provisioned island off the\r\nChinese coast, very near Luzon, and on the way to Xapon, in order to\r\nmake it serve as a way-station for his fleet, and thus carry on more\r\neasily the war with Manila, the governor sent two ships of the fleet\r\nunder command of Don Juan de Çamuzio, to reconnoiter that island and\r\nall its ports, and the nature of the place, in order to be the first\r\nto take possession of it. At least, if means and time should fail\r\nhim, he was to advise China, and the viceroys of the provinces of\r\nCanton and Chincheo, so that, since the latter were old-time enemies\r\nof Xapon, they might prevent the Japanese from entering the island,\r\nwhich would prove so harmful to all of them. In these measures and\r\nprecautions several days were spent in the matter. However, nothing\r\nwas accomplished by this expedition to Hermosa Island beyond advising\r\nGreat China of Xapon's designs.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after the imprisonment of Father Alonso Ximenez in\r\nCochinchina where Captain and Sargento-mayor Juan Xuarez Gallinato\r\nhad left him, the kings of Tunquin and Sinua permitted him to return\r\nto Manila. He took passage for Macan in a Portuguese vessel. Not only\r\ndid he arrive unwearied by his voyages, hardships, and imprisonment,\r\nbut with renewed energy and spirits proposed to set on foot again\r\nthe expedition to Camboja. Although little was known of the state\r\nof affairs in that kingdom, and of the restoration of Prauncar to\r\nhis throne, he together with other religious of his order, persuaded\r\nDon Luys Dasmariñas, upon whom he exercised great influence, and who\r\nwas then living in Manila, taking no part in government affairs, and\r\ninclined him to broach the subject of making this expedition anew and\r\nin person and at his own expense, from which would ensue good results\r\nfor the service of God and of his Majesty. Don Luys discussed the\r\nmatter with Governor Don Francisco Tello, and offered to bear all\r\nthe expense of the expedition. But a final decision was postponed\r\nuntil the receipt of news from Camboja, for their only information\r\nwas that Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso, leaving Captain Gallinato and\r\nhis ships in Cochinchina, had gone to Lao.\r\n\r\nAt the departure of Don Juan Ronquillo and his camp from Mindanao\r\nRiver, the people of Tampacan were so disheartened, and the spirit of\r\nthose of Buhahayen so increased that, in spite of the friendship that\r\nthey had made, and the homage that they had rendered, they became\r\ndeclared enemies [to the former]. Matters returned to their former\r\nstate, so that, not only did the inhabitants of Buhahayen not dismantle\r\ntheir forts, as they had promised to do, but they repaired them and\r\ncommitted other excesses against their neighbors of Tampacan. They\r\nwould have altogether broken into open war, had they not feared that\r\nthe Spaniards would return better prepared and in larger number, as\r\nthey had left the garrison at La Caldera with that intention. Thus\r\nthey let matters stand, neither declaring themselves fully as rebels,\r\nnor observing the laws of friendship toward the men of Tampacan and\r\nother allies of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nNear the island of Mindanao lies an island called Joló, not very large,\r\nbut thickly populated with natives, all Mahometans. They number about\r\nthree thousand men, and have their own lord and king. When Governor\r\nFrancisco de Sande was returning from his expedition to Borneo,\r\nhe sent Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa to Joló. He entered\r\nthe island and reduced the natives to his Majesty's rule as above\r\nrelated. The natives were apportioned to Captain Pedro de Osseguera\r\nfor his lifetime, and after his death, to his son and successor,\r\nDon Pedro de Osseguera. He asked and collected for several years\r\nwhat tribute they chose to give him, which was but slight, without\r\nurging more, in order not to make a general disturbance. While Don\r\nJuan Ronquillo was with his camp in Mindanao, the men of Joló, seeing\r\nSpanish affairs flourishing, were willing to enjoy peace and pay their\r\ntribute; but at the departure of the Spaniards, they became lukewarm\r\nagain. Captain Juan Pacho, who commanded the presidio of La Caldera\r\nin Don Juan Ronquillo's absence, having sent some soldiers to barter\r\nfor wax, the Joloans maltreated them and killed two of them. Juan\r\nPacho, with the intention of punishing this excess of the Joloans,\r\nwent there in person with several boats and thirty soldiers. As he\r\nlanded, a considerable body of Joloans descended from their king's\r\ntown, which is situated on a high and strongly-fortified hill, and\r\nattacked the Spaniards. Through the number of the natives and the\r\nSpaniards' inability to make use of their arquebuses, on account of\r\na heavy shower, the latter were routed, and Captain Juan Pacho and\r\ntwenty of his followers killed. The rest wounded and in flight took\r\nto their boats and returned to La Caldera.\r\n\r\nThis event caused great grief in Manila, especially because of the\r\nreputation lost by it, both among the Joloans, and their neighbors,\r\nthe people of Mindanao. Although it was considered necessary to punish\r\nthe Joloans in order to erase this disgrace, yet as this should be\r\ndone signally and just then there was not sufficient preparation,\r\nit was deferred until a better opportunity. Only Captain Villagra was\r\nsent immediately as commander of the presidio of La Caldera, with some\r\nsoldiers. Having arrived there, they spent their time in pleasure,\r\nuntil their provisions were consumed, and the garrison suffering. They\r\nwere maintained and supported because of the slight protection that\r\nthe people of Tampacan felt, knowing that there were Spaniards on the\r\nisland, and hoped for the arrival of more Spaniards, as Don Juan had\r\npromised them, and for punishment and vengeance upon the men of Jolo.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs in the Filipinas were in this condition, ships from\r\nNueva España arrived at Manila, in the month of May, one thousand five\r\nhundred and ninety-eight. These ships brought despatches ordering the\r\nreëstablishment of the royal Audiencia, which had been suppressed\r\nin the Filipinas some years before. Don Francisco Tello, who was\r\ngoverning the country, was named and appointed its president; Doctor\r\nAntonio de Morga and Licentiates Christoval Telles Almaçan and Alvaro\r\nRodriguez Zambrano, auditors; and Licentiate Geronymo de Salazar,\r\nfiscal; and other officials of the Audiencia were also appointed. By\r\nthe same ships arrived the archbishop, Fray Ignacio de Sanctivañes,\r\nwho enjoyed the archbishopric only for a short time, for he died of\r\ndysentery in, the month of August of the same year. The bishop of\r\nSebu, Fray Pedro de Agurto came also. On the eighth of May of this\r\nyear-five hundred and ninety-eight, the royal seal of the Audiencia\r\nwas received. It was taken from the monastery of San Agustin to the\r\ncathedral upon a horse caparisoned with cloth of gold and crimson,\r\nand under a canopy of the same material. The staves of the canopy were\r\ncarried by the regidors of the city, who were clad in robes of crimson\r\nvelvet lined with white silver cloth, and in breeches and doublets of\r\nthe same material. The horse that carried the seal in a box of cloth\r\nof gold covered with brocade was led on the right by him who held\r\nthe office of alguacil-mayor, who was clad in cloth of gold and wore\r\nno cloak. Surrounding the horse walked the president and auditors,\r\nall afoot and bareheaded. In front walked a throng of citizens clad\r\nin costly gala dress; behind followed the whole camp and the soldiers,\r\nwith their drums and banners, and their arms in hand, and the captains\r\nand officers at their posts, with the master-of-camp preceding them,\r\nstaff in hand. The streets and windows were richly adorned with\r\nquantities of tapestry and finery, and many triumphal arches, and\r\nthere was music from flutes, trumpets, and other instruments. When\r\nthe seal was taken to the door of the cathedral of Manila, the\r\narchbishop in pontifical robes came out with the cross, accompanied\r\nby the chapter and clergy of the church to receive it. Having lifted\r\nthe box containing the seal from the horse under the canopy, the\r\narchbishop placed it in the hands of the president. Then the auditors\r\nwent into the church with him, while the band of singers intoned\r\nthe Te Deum laudamus. They reached the main altar, upon the steps\r\nof which stood a stool covered with brocade. Upon this they placed\r\nthe box with the seal. All knelt and the archbishop chanted certain\r\nprayers to the Holy Spirit for the health and good government of the\r\nking, our sovereign. Then the president took the box with the seal,\r\nand with the same order and music with which it had been brought\r\ninto the church it was carried out and replaced upon the horse. The\r\narchbishop and clergy remained at the door of the church, while the\r\ncortége proceeded to the royal buildings. The said box containing the\r\nroyal seal was placed and left in a beautifully-adorned apartment,\r\nwith a covering of cloth of gold and crimson, on a table covered with\r\nbrocade and cushions of the same material, which stood under a canopy\r\nof crimson velvet embroidered with the royal arms. Then the royal\r\norder for the establishment of the Audiencia was publicly read there,\r\nand the nominations for president, auditors, and fiscal. Homage was\r\ndone them and the usual oath administered. The president proceeded\r\nto the Audiencia hall, where the court rooms were well arranged\r\nand contained a canopy for the royal arms. There the president,\r\nauditors, and fiscal took their seats and received the ministers and\r\nofficials of the Audiencia. Then the ordinances of the Audiencia\r\nwere read in the presence of as many citizens as could find room\r\nin the hall. This completed the establishment of the Audiencia\r\non that day. Thenceforth it has exercised its functions, and has\r\nhad charge and disposition in all cases, both civil and criminal,\r\nof its district. The latter includes the Filipinas Islands and all\r\nthe mainland, of China discovered or to be discovered. In charge of\r\nthe president who acts as governor of the land, were all government\r\naffairs according to royal laws, ordinances, and special orders,\r\nwhich were acted on and brought before the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nA few days after the Chancillería of the Filipinas had been established\r\nin Manila, news arrived of events in the kingdom of Camboja after\r\nthe arrival of Prauncar--son and successor of Prauncar Langara, who\r\ndied in Laos--together with Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz de Hernan\r\nGonzalez, and of his victories and restoration to the throne, as has\r\nalready been related. [The news came] in letters from King Prauncar\r\nto Governor Don Francisco Tello and Doctor Antonio de Morga. They\r\nwere signed by the king's hand and seal in red ink. The letters were\r\nwritten in Castilian so that they might be better understood. Since\r\nthey were alike in essence, I thought it proper to reproduce here\r\nthe letter written by King Prauncar to Doctor Antonio de Morga,\r\nwhich reads word for word as follows.\r\n\r\nPrauncar, King of Camboja, to Doctor Antonio de Morga, greeting;\r\nto whom I send this letter with great love and joy.\r\n\r\nI, Prauncar, King of the rich land of Camboja, I, sole lord of it,\r\nthe great, cherish an ardent love for Doctor Antonio de Morga, whom\r\nI am unable to keep from my thoughts, because I have learned through\r\nCaptain Chofa Don Blas, the Castilian, that he, from the kindness\r\nof his heart, took an active part and has assisted the governor of\r\nLuzon to send to this country Captain Chofa Don Blas, the Castilian,\r\nand Captain Chofa Don Diego, the Portuguese, with soldiers to find\r\nKing Prauncar my father. Having searched for him in vain, the two\r\nchofas and the soldiers killed Anacaparan, who was reigning as sole\r\ngreat lord. Then they went with their ships to Cochinchina, whence the\r\ntwo chofas went to Lao, to find the king of this land. They brought\r\nme back to my kingdom, and I am here now through their aid. The two\r\nchofas and other Spaniards who have come, have helped me to pacify\r\nwhat I now hold. I understand that all this has come to me because the\r\ndoctor loves this country. Hence I shall act so that Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga may always love me as he did my father Prauncar, and assist\r\nme now by sending fathers for the two chofas and the other Spaniards\r\nand Christians who dwell in my kingdom. I shall build them churches\r\nand permit them to christianize whatever Cambodians choose to become\r\nChristians. I shall provide them with servants and I shall protect them\r\nas did formerly King Prauncar my father. I shall provide Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga with whatever will be useful to him from this country. The two\r\nchofas have received the lands which I promised them. To Captain Don\r\nBlas, the Castilian, I gave the province of Tran, and to Captain Chofa\r\nDon Diego, the Portuguese, the province of Bapano. These provinces I\r\ngrant and bestow upon them for the services which they have rendered\r\nme and in payment for the property they have spent in my service,\r\nso that they may possess and enjoy them as their own, and do what\r\nthey will with them while in my service. [96]\r\n\r\nTogether with the king's letter Blas Ruis de Hernan Gonzalez wrote\r\nanother detailed letter to Doctor Morga, informing him of all the\r\nevents of his expeditions. The letter reads as follows.\r\n\r\nTo Doctor Antonio de Morga, Lieutenant-governor of the Filipinas\r\nIslands of Luzon, in the city of Manila, whom may our Lord preserve.\r\n\r\nFrom Camboja: Your Grace must have already heard of events in this\r\nkingdom of Camboja, from my arrival until the captain withdrew the\r\nfleet. These accounts will undoubtedly vary according to what each man\r\nthought fit to say in order to gild his own affairs: some according to\r\ntheir bent and opinion, and others according to their passion. Although\r\nthe matter has been witnessed and thoroughly known by many persons, I\r\nam about to relate it as well as possible to your Grace, as to a person\r\nwho can weld all the facts together and give to each circumstance\r\nthe weight which it may possess and deserve. I shall also give an\r\naccount among other things of all that happened to Captain Diego\r\nBelloso and myself on the journey to Lao, and the vicissitudes and\r\nwars in this kingdom, from our arrival until the condition of affairs\r\nnow in force. Since Spaniards have taken part in all these events it\r\nwill please your Grace to know the manner and retirement with which\r\nI have lived in this kingdom ever since my arrival here from Manila,\r\nsustaining the soldiers and other men whom I brought in my ship at\r\nmy own expense, keeping them in a state of discipline and honor,\r\nand never allowing them to abandon themselves to sensual pleasures;\r\nalthough I had no credentials for this, for Gallinato had those which\r\nthe governor was to give me. I shall not discuss the why and wherefore\r\nof most of the Chinese matters, because Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray\r\nDiego [97] witnessed some of the events and heard of others and will\r\nhave informed your Grace of everything, including the war against the\r\nusurper, and Gallinato's abandonment of this kingdom when affairs had\r\npractically been settled. Had he continued to follow up matters, half\r\nof the kingdom would today justly belong to his Majesty, and the whole\r\nof it would be in the power and under the rule of the Spaniards; and\r\nperhaps the king himself with most of his people would have embraced\r\nChristianity. As to Chinese matters which require most explanation I\r\nonly ask your Grace to consider the kingdom which we came to help,\r\nthat the Chinese had no more right there than we had, and that we\r\nhad to try to gain reputation, not to lose it. Since we came with\r\na warlike attitude, and it was the first time that an armed Spanish\r\nforce set foot on the mainland, was it right for us to endure insults,\r\nabuse, contempt, and open affronts from a so vile race as they are,\r\nand before all these pagans? [Was it right to endure] the further\r\naction of their arguments before the usurping king, to induce him to\r\nkill us; their many evil and infamous reports to him concerning us,\r\nin order to induce him to grant their request; and above all their\r\nimpudence in killing and disarming Spaniards and going out in the\r\nstreets to spear them? All this I endured very patiently in order\r\nnot to disturb the land by breaking with them, until one day when\r\nthey actually tried to kill some of our men in their Parián, and the\r\nnumbers being very unequal, they had already wounded and maltreated\r\nthem. We came out at the noise and the Chinese drew up in battle\r\narray, armed with many warlike instruments, challenging us to battle,\r\nwith insults and expressions of contempt. At this juncture, what would\r\nhave become of our reputation had we retired when the advantage was on\r\ntheir side? Then, too, after attacking and killing many of them what\r\nsecurity had we in this tyrannical kingdom, which showed itself not\r\nat all friendly to us, with only one ship, [98] which was at the time\r\naground, and with the artillery and provisions ashore; while they had\r\nsix ships and many rowboats all provided with one or two culverins\r\nand many men, both in the ships and those living in the port? [99]\r\nWould it have been right, after war had broken out, to have them\r\nwith all their resources while we had none? Had they taken our lives,\r\nwhat reputation would the Spaniards have left in these kingdoms? For\r\nthis reason I thought it better for us to overpower them, rather\r\nthan to be at their mercy, or at that of the king. Accordingly, in\r\norder to assure our lives we were obliged to seize their ships and\r\nto strengthen ourselves by means of them, since the Chinese began\r\nthe war. After this, father Fray Alonso Ximenez and we thought that,\r\nby making an embassy with presents to the king, and by exculpating\r\nourselves in this matter, before him, everything would turn out well;\r\nand that if we had peace with him, and our persons in safety in a fort,\r\nor under his word and safe-conduct, we would give the Chinese their\r\nship and property. All this was written out and signed by us. In order\r\nto carry this out, a letter was written in the name of the governor of\r\nthat city [i.e., Manila], and we went to deliver it nine leguas away\r\nat the residence of the king, leaving the vessels guarded. But when he\r\nfound us there, the king deprived us of the boats in which we had gone,\r\nand refused to receive the letter, which went under form of embassy,\r\nor to hear us unless we first restored the ships. Then he immediately\r\nbegan to prepare arms and to assemble many men, with the intention,\r\nunless we restored the ships, of killing us, or reducing us by force\r\nto such straits as to compel us to restore them; and after their\r\nrestoration, of making an end of us all without trouble or risk to his\r\nown men. For he trusted us in nothing, since we were going in search\r\nof, and bringing help to, him whom he had dispossessed. All this was\r\ntold us by some Christians among them, especially by a young mestizo\r\nfrom Malaca who lived among them and knew their language. Therefore\r\nconsidering that we were already separated from our companions,\r\nand that, if we restored the ships, they could easily take ours by\r\nmeans of them and kill the men left in them, and then us who were in\r\nthat place; also that if we waited for them to collect and attack us,\r\nthey could very easily kill us: we decided to seek the remedy by first\r\nattacking them instead of waiting to be attacked; and try to rejoin\r\nour men and assure our lives or end them by fighting. Accordingly we\r\nattacked them, and such was our good fortune that we killed the king\r\nin the fight. Then we retired to our ships with great difficulty,\r\nwithout the loss of a single Spaniard. We did not allow the king's\r\nhouse to be sacked, so that it might not be said that we had done\r\nthis to rob him. At this juncture, the captain and sargento-mayor,\r\nour leader, arrived. He belittled and censured what we had done, and\r\nridiculed our statement and that of some of the Cambodians, namely,\r\nthat we had killed the usurper. All that he did was simply to collect\r\nwhatever silver and gold certain soldiers seized during these troubles,\r\nand everything valuable in the ships, and then to burn the latter. Then\r\nhe drew up a report against us and dispossessed us of our ships and\r\ncommand, thus formulating suspicion and distrust. After that he gave\r\norders for the departure from the kingdom, paying no heed to many\r\nCambodians who came to speak to us when we went ashore, and told\r\nus that we might build a fortress there, for they had a legitimate\r\nking before, but that he who was their king lately had driven him\r\nto Lao, and thus they had no king; that they would gather wherever\r\nthe most protection could be found; and that we should continue the\r\nwar. Nor did the captain accept any of our suggestions, when we told\r\nhim that the usurper had imprisoned a kinsman of the lawful king;\r\nthat we should go to his rescue; that the latter would raise men\r\nin favor of the legitimate king; and that with his support we would\r\ntake possession of the kingdom, and then go to get the king. But he\r\nwas deaf to all this and accordingly abandoned the kingdom, and this\r\ngreat opportunity was lost. The only thing that we could obtain from\r\nhim by great entreaty after putting to sea, was to go to Cochinchina\r\nto inquire about the galley, since they had intended to send from\r\nManila for that purpose. I also offered to go to Lao by land at my\r\nown expense, in search of the king of Camboja, for I knew that that\r\nway led thither. Accordingly, as soon as we arrived in Cochinchina,\r\nthe captain sent Diego Belloso and myself to Lao, and Captain Gregorio\r\nde Vargas to Tunquin. Meanwhile he held an auction among the soldiers\r\nof everything valuable from the Chinese ships, and of what else he\r\nhad taken from the soldiers; but the men were all without a real,\r\nand so he had everything bought for himself, at whatever price he was\r\npleased to give. The king of Sinoa, a province of Cochinchina, equipped\r\nus for the voyage with a good outfit, by giving us an embassy for that\r\ncountry, and men to accompany us on the road. Thus we made the entire\r\njourney well provided and always highly honored and feared and much\r\nlooked at, as the like had never before been seen in those kingdoms.\r\n\r\nWe were all sick on the road; but in all our troubles we were greatly\r\ncomforted by the love which the people showed towards us, and: by the\r\nkind reception that we met at the hands of all. Finally we reached\r\nLanchan, the capital and the royal seat of the kingdom. This kingdom\r\nhas a vast territory, but it is thinly populated because it has been\r\noften devastated by Pegu. It has mines of gold, silver, copper, iron,\r\nbrass, [sic] and tin. It produces silk, benzoin, lac, brasil, wax, and\r\nivory. There are also rhinoceroses, many elephants, and horses larger\r\nthan those of China. Lao is bounded on the east by Cochinchina and\r\non the northeast and north by China and Tartaria, from which places\r\ncame the sheep and the asses that were there when I went. Much of\r\ntheir merchandise is exported by means of these animals. On its west\r\nand southwest lie Pegu and Sian, and on the south and southeast,\r\nit is bounded by Camboja and Champan. [100] It is a rich country,\r\nand everything imported there is very expensive. Before our arrival\r\nat Lanchan, a cousin of the exiled king, on account of the usurper's\r\ndeath, had fled thither from Camboja, fearing lest the latter's son\r\nwho was then ruling would kill him. He related what we had done in\r\nCamboja, in consequence of which the king of Lao received us very\r\ncordially, and showed great respect for us, praising our deeds and\r\nshowing amazement that they had been accomplished by so few. When\r\nwe arrived the old king of Camboja, together with his elder son and\r\ndaughter, had already died, and there was left only the younger\r\nson with his mother, aunt, and grandmother. These women rejoiced\r\ngreatly over our deeds and arrival, and more attention was given them\r\nthenceforth. Before our arrival at the city, we met an ambassador,\r\nwhom the usurping king, Anacaparan, had sent from Camboja, in order\r\nthat he might reach Lanchan before we did, and see what was going\r\non there. He feigned excuse and pretext of asking for the old queen,\r\nwho was the step-mother of the dead king Prauncar, and whom Anacaparan\r\nclaimed to be his father's sister. The king of Lao was sending her,\r\nbut at our arrival, and on our assuring him of Anacaparan's death, he\r\nordered her to return, and the ambassador, for fear of being killed,\r\nfled down the river in a boat to Camboja. Then we declared our embassy,\r\nand asked for the heir of the kingdom in order to take him to our\r\nships and thence to his own country. We were answered that he [i.e.,\r\nthe younger son] was the only one, and that they could not allow him\r\nto go, especially through a foreign country, and over such rough roads\r\nand seas. The youth wished to come, but his mothers [101] would not\r\nconsent to it. Finally it was decided that we should return to the\r\nfleet and proceed with it to Camboja. We were to send them advices\r\nfrom there, whereupon they would send him under a large escort. His\r\nmothers gave me letters directed to that city [i.e., Manila], making\r\ngreat promises to the Spaniards on behalf of the kingdom, if they would\r\nreturn to Camboja to pacify the land and restore it to them. The king\r\nof Lao entrusted me with another embassy, in which he petitioned for\r\nfriendship and requested that the fleet return to Camboja, adding that,\r\nshould Gallinato be unwilling to return, he would send large forces\r\nby land to our assistance, under command of the heir himself. Thus we\r\ntook leave and went to Cochinchina. While these things were happening\r\nin Lao, the following occurred in Camboja. As soon as the fleet had\r\ndeparted, the news of Anacaparan's death was published. When it was\r\nheard by Chupinaqueo, kinsman of the lawful king, who was in prison,\r\nhe escaped from his prison, incited a province to rise, collected\r\nits men, and having proclaimed Prauncar as the lawful king, came to\r\nget us with about six thousand men, in order to join us and make war\r\nupon the sons of the usurper, who were now ruling. Not finding us in\r\nChordemuco, where our ships had been lying, he sent boats to look\r\nfor us as far as the bar. Seeing that we were nowhere to be found\r\nhe seized all the Chinese and other people there, and returned to\r\nhis province where he had gathered his forces, and there he fortified\r\nhimself. Meanwhile the men at Champan, who had gone thither to take it,\r\nreturned, whereupon the commander of the camp, called Ocuña de Chu,\r\ntook sides with the sons of the usurper and had one of them--the\r\nsecond--Chupinanu by name, proclaimed king, because he was the most\r\nwarlike. For this reason, the elder brother, called Chupinanon,\r\nand those of his party were angered, and consequently there was\r\ncontinual strife between them. Then all having united, together with\r\nthe army from Chanpan, pursued Chupinaqueo, who came out to meet\r\nthem with many of his men. They fought for many days, but at last it\r\nwas Chupinaqueo's fate to be conquered and cruelly killed. Thus for\r\nthe time being Chupinanu ruled as king, and the camp was disbanded,\r\neach man going to his own home. At this time a ship arrived from\r\nMalaca on an embassy, bringing some Spaniards who came in search\r\nof us, and a number of Japanese. Chupinanu would have liked to have\r\nkilled them all, but seeing that they came on an embassy, and from\r\nMalaca, he let them go immediately. A large province, called Tele,\r\nseeing the cruelty with which the king treated them, revolted, and\r\ndeclaring themselves free, proclaimed a new king; then they marched\r\nagainst Chupinanu, and defeated and routed him, took from him a large\r\nnumber of elephants and artillery, and sacked his city. In the battle,\r\nmost of the Spaniards and Japanese who had come from Malaca were\r\nkilled. Chupinanu retreated with all his brothers, six in number,\r\nto another province, always accompanied by Ocuña de Chu. There they\r\nbegan to make plans and to collect men. They also invited two Malays,\r\nleaders of all the other Malays on whom Chupinanu relied strongly,\r\nwho on the break-up of the camp after Chupinaqueo's death, had gone\r\nto the lands of which they were magistrates. But in order that what\r\nfollows may be understood, I will tell who these Malays are. When\r\nthis country was being ravaged by Sian, these two went to Chanpan,\r\ntaking with them many of their Malays, as well as many Cambodians;\r\nand because the ruler of Champan did not show them all the honors that\r\nthey desired, they caused an insurrection in the city when he was\r\naway. They fortified themselves there, and then plundered the city,\r\nafter which they returned to this kingdom with all the artillery\r\nand many captives. When they arrived here the usurper Anacaparan\r\nwas ruling. Congratulating one another mutually for their deeds,\r\nthe usurper gave them a friendly welcome, and they gave him all\r\nthe artillery and other things which they had brought. Then the\r\nusurper gave them lands for their maintenance, and made them great\r\nmandarins. These two Malays made it easy for him to capture Champan,\r\nand offered to seize its king. Since the latter had been so great\r\nand long-standing an enemy of the Cambodians, Anacaparan immediately\r\ncollected an army, which he sent under command of Ocuña de Chu. When\r\nwe killed Anacaparan, these forces were in Chanpan, and, as abovesaid,\r\nthey returned after his death. These men presented themselves before\r\nthe new king, Chupinanu, with all their Malays and it was at once\r\ndecided to attack the insurgents of Tele. At this juncture arrived the\r\nambassador who had fled from Lao as we reached Lanchan. He said that\r\nwe had remained there and that our purpose was to ask for the lawful\r\nheir of Camboja in order to take him to our ships and transport him\r\nto his kingdom; that the king of Cochinchina was going to help us\r\nin this undertaking; that we had entered Lao with that report; and\r\nthat the king of Lao was about to send the heir with great forces by\r\nriver and by land, while we and the men of Cochinchina would go by\r\nsea and join them in Camboja, where we would declare war and inflict\r\nsevere punishment upon whomsoever would not render homage. When the\r\nnew king and his followers heard this news they were frightened, and\r\nconsequently each thought only of himself. A few days later it was\r\nreported from the bar that four Spanish ships had entered, accompanied\r\nby many galleys from Cochinchina. This report was either a vision that\r\nsome had seen, or was a fiction; and we have been unable to clarify\r\nthe matter to this very day. At any rate, on hearing this news, these\r\npeople confirmed as true the entire report of the ambassador who had\r\nfled. The mandarins of Camboja, taking into consideration the war which\r\nwas now waging with the men of Tele, and the new one threatened by the\r\nSpaniards, Cochinchina, and Lao, decided to depose the new king and\r\nrender homage to the one who was coming from Lao. For this purpose they\r\ncommunicated with the two Malays and together with them attacked the\r\nking with his brothers and turned them out of the realm. The two elder\r\nbrothers fled separately, each to the province where he thought to find\r\nmore friends. After this the mandarins ordered a fleet of row-boats to\r\nproceed toward Lao to receive their king, who they said was already\r\ncoming. They sent Ocuña de Chu as leader of the fleet and also his\r\ntwo sons. Other boats were sent to the bar to receive the Spaniards,\r\nand make friendly terms with them, sending for that purpose certain\r\nSpaniards there. Two Cambodian mandarins and the two Malays were to\r\nremain to guard the kingdom, and to act as governors. The Spaniards\r\nwent to the bar, but, finding nothing, returned. Ocuña de Chu took the\r\nroad to Lao, but seeing that he did not meet his king, or hear any news\r\nof him, resolved to go to Lanchan and ask for him. He continued his\r\nmarch, but suffered some pangs of hunger, for he had left the kingdom\r\nunprovided, and the way was long. On account of this some of his men\r\ndeserted, but at last he reached Lanchan with ten armed praus. All\r\nthe kingdom of Lao was thrown into great confusion. Imagining that he\r\nwas coming to make war, they abandoned their villages and property,\r\nand fled to the mountains. But on seeing that he was coming on a\r\npeaceful mission, they lost their apprehension. At his arrival we\r\nwere already on the road to Cochinchina, whereupon the king ordered\r\nus to return to Lanchan immediately. The king [of Lao], on learning\r\nwhat was happening in Camboja, despatched there a large fleet by\r\nsea, and forces by land, and sent for the king of that country. He\r\ndespatched me to Cochinchina with news of what was happening, and\r\nto take the ships to Camboja; but, while on the way, I heard of the\r\nbattle fought by our fleet, whereupon I returned to Camboja with the\r\nking. When we reached the first village of the kingdom, we learned\r\nfrom the spies who had preceded us, that, as the news of the ships\r\nhad been untrue, and Cuña de Chu was delaying so long, the provinces\r\nwhere the two brothers sought shelter had proclaimed them kings,\r\nand were at war with one another; that the people of Tele had come\r\nto fight with the governors, who were divided into factions; and that\r\neach man obeyed whom he pleased. But they said that Ocuña Lacasamana,\r\none of the Malay headmen, had the greatest force of artillery\r\nand praus; and that a Japanese junk--the one that had been in\r\nCochinchina when our fleet was there--had arrived, and was supporting\r\nChupinannu. The sea and land forces were collected together at the\r\npoint where this news had been received, and it was found that they\r\nwere not sufficient to make a warlike entry. A fort was built there,\r\nand a request for more men sent to Lao. In the meantime, secret letters\r\nwere despatched to probe the hearts of the leading men. The men from\r\nLao delayed, and no answers were received to the letters. Feeling\r\ninsecure in that place, they deliberated upon returning to Lao,\r\nbut at this juncture news arrived from Ocuña Lacasamana, one of the\r\nMalays who had fortified himself in his own land, saying that he was\r\non their side, although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu--a feigned\r\npromise because he had seen the king's delay--but that as soon as the\r\nking entered the land he would join his party. Soon after news came\r\nfrom another Cambojan governor, to the effect that, although he had\r\nrendered homage to Chupinanu, yet, if the king would come to him,\r\nhe would attack Chupinanu, and depose or kill him. For that he said\r\nthat he had four thousand men fortified with himself on a hill. He\r\nsent one of his relatives with this message. All trusted in this man,\r\nand immediately we set out for that place. When the above-mentioned\r\nman learned of the king's approach, he attacked the other king and\r\nrouted him; then he came out to receive us, and thus we entered. That\r\nprovince and many others were delivered to us immediately. Chupinanu\r\nwithdrew to some mountains. Immediately the two Malays, each with\r\nhis forces, joined us; the Japanese did the same. The king then gave\r\norders to pursue Chupinanu until he was taken and killed. Then he\r\nseized another man who was acting as judge in another province and\r\nput him to death. Soon after war began against the eldest of the\r\nbrothers and against the people of Tele who also refused homage. At\r\nthis juncture, a ship arrived from Malaca with fourteen Spaniards of\r\nour fleet, who had put into Malaca. The king was delighted thereat,\r\nand honored and made much of them, when he learned that they were\r\nsome of the men who had killed the usurper. They were esteemed and\r\nrespected in an extraordinary manner by the whole kingdom. Captain\r\nDiego Belloso tried to assume charge of them by virtue of an old\r\ndocument from Malaca; this I forbade, alleging that the right of this\r\njurisdiction should proceed from Manila, since the restoration of this\r\nkingdom proceeded from that place, and that those men were Castilians\r\nand had nothing to do with his document or with Malaca. The king,\r\nbefore whom this matter was brought, replied that the matter lay\r\nbetween us two, and refused to mingle in those affairs. Some of the\r\nnewcomers coincided with Belloso's opinion, and others with mine;\r\nand thus we have gone on until now. This has been the cause of my\r\nnot asking the king for a fort to secure our personal safety. It\r\nwould have been a footing for some business, [102] and what I shall\r\nrelate later would not have happened to us. After the arrival of the\r\nCastilians, the king sent an embassy to Cochinchina--a Spaniard and a\r\nCambodian--to get father Fray Alonso Ximenez and certain Spaniards,\r\nwho, as we heard, had remained there. The ruler of Chanpan seized\r\nthem, and they have not returned. The wars continued, in all of\r\nwhich the Spaniards and Japanese took part. Whatever we attacked,\r\nwe conquered with God's assistance, but where we did not go, losses\r\nalways resulted. Consequently we gained great reputation and were\r\nesteemed by our friends and feared by the enemy. While we were making\r\nan incursion, Ocuña de Chu, who was now called manbaray--the highest\r\ntitle in the kingdom--tried to revolt. In this he was aided by one of\r\nthe Malay chiefs called Cancona. The king summoned me and ordered me\r\nto bring with me the Spaniards of my party. He ordered Diego Belloso\r\nto remain, for both of us were leaders and still are, in any war in\r\nwhich any of us is engaged. I came at his bidding, and he told me that\r\nthose men were trying to kill him and deprive him of his kingdom,\r\nand asked me to prevent such a thing. The mambaray was the one who\r\nruled the kingdom, and since the king was young and addicted to wine,\r\nhe held the latter in little esteem and considered himself as king. At\r\nlast, I, aided by Spaniards, killed him; then his sons were captured\r\nand killed. Afterward the Malay Cancona was seized and killed, and\r\nthe king was extricated from this peril by the Spaniards. Then we\r\nreturned to the war. I learned that another grandee who was head of a\r\nprovince was trying to rebel and join Chupinannon; I captured him and\r\nafter trying him, put him to death. Therefore the king showed great\r\nesteem for us, and the kingdom feared us; that province was subdued\r\nand we returned to the king. At this time a vessel arrived from Sian,\r\nand ported here on its way to an embassy at Manila. On board this\r\nvessel were father Fray Pedro Custodio and some Portuguese. The king\r\nwas greatly delighted at the arrival of the father and wished to build\r\nhim a church. We all united and continued the war. Again we returned,\r\nafter having reduced many provinces to the obedience of the king,\r\nand left Chupinanon secluded on some mountains, thus almost ending\r\nthe war. Hereupon many Laos arrived under the leadership of one\r\nof their king's relatives, for hitherto they had done nothing nor\r\nuttered any sound. I do not know whether it was from envy at seeing\r\nus so high in the king's favor and that of the people of the kingdom,\r\nor whether they decided the matter beforehand in their own country;\r\nthey killed a Spaniard with but slight pretext. When we asked the\r\nking for justice in this matter, the latter ordered his mandarins to\r\njudge the case. Meanwhile we sent for the Japanese who were carrying\r\non the war in another region, in order to take vengeance if justice\r\nwere not done. The Laos, either fearing this, or purposing to make\r\nan end of us, attacked our quarters at night and killed the father\r\nand several Spaniards who had accompanied him and who were sick;\r\nthey also killed some Japanese, for their anger was directed against\r\nall. The rest of us escaped and took refuge on the Japanese vessel,\r\nwhere we defended ourselves until the arrival of the Japanese. The\r\nLaos made a fort and strengthened themselves therein. There were about\r\nsix thousand of them. They sent a message to the king saying that\r\nthey would not agree to any act of justice which he might order to\r\nbe carried out. The king was very angry for the deaths that they had\r\ncaused, and for the disrespect with which they treated him; but, in\r\norder not to break with their king, he refused to give us forces with\r\nwhich to attack them, although we often requested him to do so; nor did\r\nwe attack them ourselves, as we were without weapons. The king sent\r\nword of this affair to Lao, and we remained for the time, stripped,\r\nwithout property, without arms, without justice or revenge, and quite\r\nangry at the king, although he was continually sending us excuses,\r\nsaying that if the king of Lao did not do justice in this matter,\r\nhe himself would do it, and would not let them leave the country on\r\nthat account; he also sent us food, and some clothes and weapons. At\r\nthis juncture a ship was despatched on an embassy to Malaca in which\r\nwe wished to embark, but neither the king nor his mothers would allow\r\nDiego Belloso or me to leave. Some of the Spaniards embarked in it,\r\nsome returned to Sian, and others remained with us; and the king from\r\nthat time on made us more presents than ever. The Japanese gathered in\r\ntheir ship, and refused to continue the war. When the enemy learned\r\nthat we were in confusion, they collected large forces and regained\r\nmany undefended regions. The king requested the Laos to go to war,\r\nsince they had thrown into confusion those who were defending his\r\ncountry. They went, lost the first battle, and returned completely\r\nrouted, leaving many dead and wounded on the field. Chupinanon followed\r\nup the victory and came within sight of the king's residence, only\r\na river separating them. Thereupon the king quite disregarded the\r\nLaos, and persuaded us and the Japanese to take up arms again and\r\ndefend him. By this time we had all reëquipped ourselves with arms\r\nand ammunition, and after much entreaty from him and his mothers, we\r\nwent to war and relieved a fortress which Chupinanon was besieging. We\r\nwon two battles and forced him to withdraw, thus taking from him all\r\nhe had just regained, as well as other lands which had remained in\r\nthose regions. We captured a quantity of rice and provisions from\r\nthe enemy--with which the king's forces recuperated themselves,\r\nfor they were suffering famine--and we went into quarters. This we\r\ndid, I, the Spaniards, and the Japanese who were on my side. Diego\r\nBelloso and his men went to Tele, killed its king, and returned after\r\nhaving conquered part of the province. At this time a Portuguese ship\r\narrived from Macao, [103] laden with merchandise; on which account,\r\nand on beholding our deeds, the Laos were filled with great fear\r\nof us, and without leave from the king, departed in boats to their\r\ncountry. Thereupon we went to the king, and requested him not to let\r\nthem go without doing justice, unless he wished to break friendship\r\nwith Luzon and Malaca. He replied that he did not dare detain them,\r\nbut that if we wished to pursue and dared to fight them, he would\r\nsecretly give us men. Accordingly we all negotiated for ten praus,\r\nand followed them. But since they were far ahead of us and under\r\nthe spell of fear, we could not overtake them for many days. For\r\nthis reason Belloso turned back with some Spaniards and Japanese. I\r\nfollowed with great difficulty--on account of certain strong currents,\r\nfor we dragged the praus part way with ropes--although with but few\r\nmen, until I overtook many of the Laos, and seized their praus and\r\npossessions, from which we all received compensation and gained\r\nstill more in reputation, which at present we enjoy to a higher\r\ndegree than was ever enjoyed by any nation in foreign lands. We are\r\ngreatly esteemed by the king and his men, and by those native here;\r\nand greatly feared by foreigners. Accordingly we receive great respect\r\nin all parts of the kingdom. They have bestowed upon Captain Diego\r\nBelloso and myself the title of grandee, the highest in their kingdom,\r\nso that we may be more respected and feared, and better obeyed. Two\r\nof the best provinces in the kingdom are entered in our names, and\r\nwill be made over to us as soon as the turmoils of war are settled\r\nand assemblies have been held to take the oaths to the king, which\r\nhas not yet been done. In the meantime we are making use of other\r\npeople whom the king orders to be given us. There is no opportunity\r\nin the kingdom for any one else to possess entire power and command,\r\nbeyond Ocuña Lacasamana, leader of the Malays, whom the king favors on\r\naccount of his large forces, and because he needs him for the wars in\r\nwhich he is engaged. The Spaniards have some encounters with his men,\r\nfor which reason we hold aloof from one another. I have informed\r\nyour Grace so minutely of these wars and affairs, in order that\r\nit may be judged whether his Majesty has any justifiable and legal\r\nright to seize any portion of this kingdom, since his forces killed\r\nthe man who was quietly in possession of it; and since its heir, who\r\nwas driven away where he had lost hope of ever again possessing it,\r\nhas afterward reconquered it through his Majesty's subjects, who have\r\nguarded and defended his person from his enemies. For the hope that the\r\nking will give it up voluntarily will never be realized, as he rather\r\nfears having so many Spaniards in his country, even while he esteems\r\nthem; for he dreads lest they deprive him of his kingdom, since he\r\nsees that this only requires the determination therefor. Some of our\r\nenemies impress this fact upon him, especially the Moros. I beg and\r\nentreat your Grace, who can do so much in this matter, to see that we\r\ndo not lose our hold on this land, since so much has been accomplished\r\nin it, and it has been brought to a so satisfactory state. Moreover\r\nit is very important to possess a fortress on the mainland, since it\r\nis the beginning of great things. For if a fortress be built here,\r\nand the king see a large force in this land, he would have to do what\r\nhe knows to be just, even if ill-disposed. I say this on account of\r\nhis mother, aunt, and grandmother, who rule and govern, for he only\r\ndoes as they tell him. He is a child and is addicted to wine more\r\nthan his father; he only thinks of sports and hunting, and cares\r\nnothing for the kingdom. Therefore should he see many Spaniards,\r\nand that nobody could harm them, he would do whatever they wished,\r\nbecause, as above-said, he loves them; neither would our opponents\r\ndare to offer any opposition. If perchance there should be so few men\r\nin the Filipinas at present that no great number of them can be sent,\r\nat least send as many as possible with the fathers, so as not to\r\nlose this jurisdiction and our share in anything; for Diego Belloso\r\nsent to Malaca for religious, men, and documents, so that by that\r\nmeans he may become chief justice of this land, and make over this\r\njurisdiction to Malaca. Since this kingdom has been restored by that\r\nkingdom [i.e., the Philippines], your Grace should not allow others to\r\nreap the fruits of our labors. If some soldiers should come, and the\r\nCambodians should refuse them the wherewithal to maintain themselves\r\nbecause of their small number, and not fearing them, I would do here\r\nwhatever your Grace bade me, so long as it were reasonable; and until\r\nmore soldiers came, I could manage to make the Cambodians give it,\r\nhowever much against their inclination. These men should come bound\r\nhard and fast by documents, so that, as the country is very vast,\r\nthey should not be tempted to avail themselves of license, for lack of\r\ndiscipline was the cause of our encounter with the Laos. It has been\r\nvery difficult for me to despatch this vessel, because little is given\r\nto the king for any purpose, and because there were many opponents to\r\nprevent it--for it is evident that the mandarins, whether native or\r\nforeign, are not pleased to see men set over them in the kingdom--and\r\nas I am poor, for I have lived hitherto by war, and subsisted from\r\nits gains by many wars, for the king also is very poor. The Spaniard\r\nwhom I entrust with this mission is poor and an excellent soldier;\r\nand to enable him to go, I have assisted him from my indigence. Will\r\nyour Grace please assist both him and the Cambodian, in order that\r\nthe latter may become acquainted with some of the grandeur of his\r\nMajesty. I would rejoice to be the bearer of this, so as to give your\r\nGrace a long account of these affairs and of other notable things,\r\nand of the fertility of these kingdoms; but neither the king nor his\r\nmothers have allowed me to go, as the bearer will state, among other\r\nthings. Your Grace may believe him, for he is a person disinterested in\r\nall respects, having just arrived from Macan. On account of the many\r\nwars, the king does not possess many things to send your Grace. He\r\nsends two ivory tusks, and a slave. Your Grace will forgive him; he\r\nwill send many things next year, if the pacification of his country is\r\naccomplished, for he still has something to do in it. I have spoken to\r\nhim and persuaded him to send to that city [i.e., Manila] to request\r\nsoldiers, in order to complete the pacification of the country; but\r\nhis mothers would not have it on any account, I am sure that they\r\nact thus in order not to promise them lands for their maintenance,\r\nor that they may not seize the land. But when they were in Lao,\r\nthey promised very vast lands. But if what is done is not sufficient\r\nto provide for them, let the mercy of God suffice. When this embassy\r\nwas despatched, Diego Belloso and myself told the king that if he did\r\nnot give us the lands that he had promised us, we intended to go to\r\nLuzon, because we did not now possess the wherewithal with which to\r\nmaintain ourselves. Many things occurred with respect to this request,\r\nbut finally he gave us the lands, as is stated in the embassy; he\r\ngave them to us on condition of our holding them in his service and\r\nobedience. By this means I shall have more resources for your Grace's\r\nservice. I spent all my possessions in meeting the expenses that I\r\nincurred in that city [i.e., Manila], and in maintaining my men in\r\nthis kingdom. For that purpose I took the silver of the common seamen\r\nof my vessel, and although I paid the latter with some silver which\r\nwe found in the [Chinese] ships, Gallinato would not consent to it,\r\nbut took it all for himself. In Malaca they made me pay it out of\r\nthe property on my ship, and would not consent to their being paid\r\nout of the prizes, since the war was considered a just one. [104] For\r\nthis reason I am now destitute of any property, and therefore do not\r\npossess the means of serving your Grace as I ought and as I should\r\nhave desired. Recollecting your Grace's unique armory I send you a\r\nbottle and a small flask of ivory. Your Grace will forgive the trifle\r\nfor I promise to compensate for it next year. Your Grace may command\r\nme in any service for I shall take great pleasure therein. Will your\r\nGrace do me the favor to protect my affairs, so that they may gain\r\nsome merit by your favor. Trusting to this, may our Lord preserve\r\nyour Grace, and give you increase in your dignity, as this servant\r\nof your Grace desires in your affairs. From Camboja, July twenty,\r\none thousand five hundred and ninety-eight.\r\n\r\nYour Grace's servant,\r\n\r\nBLAS RUYZ DE HERNAN GONÇALES\r\n\r\nThrough this news and despatch from Camboja we learned in Manila of\r\nthe good result attained by the stay of Diego Belloso and Blas Ruys in\r\nthat land. Don Luys Dasmariñas gaining encouragement in the enterprise\r\nthat he had proposed, discussed it with greater warmth. But since\r\ndifficulties were still raised as to the justification with which an\r\nentrance could be made into Camboja with armed forces for more than\r\nthe protection of, and completion of establishing, Prauncar in his\r\nkingdom, and to leave preachers with him--it was said on Don Luys's\r\nbehalf that after accomplishing the above, he would, with the necessary\r\nfavor of the same king of Camboja, proceed to the neighboring kingdom\r\nof Champan and take possession of it for his Majesty. He would drive\r\nthence a usurper, the common enemy of all those kingdoms, who lorded\r\nover it, and who, from his fortress near the sea, sallied out against\r\nall navigators, plundering and capturing them. He had committed many\r\nother crimes, murders, and thefts, on the Portuguese and other nations,\r\nwho were obliged to pass his coasts in their trading with, and voyages\r\nto, China, Macan, Xapon, and other kingdoms, concerning all of which\r\nsufficient testimony had been given. On account of all these reports,\r\nthe theologians and jurists decided that the war against the ruler\r\nof Champan and the conquest of his lands was justifiable, and that\r\nthis position was of no less importance to the Spaniards than that\r\nof Camboja.\r\n\r\nThe governor and president, Don Francisco Tello, held a consultation\r\nwith the Audiencia and others--religious and captains--as to what in\r\ntheir opinion was the most advisable measure to take in this matter. It\r\nwas resolved that, since Don Luys offered to make this expedition\r\nat his own expense with those men who chose to follow him, the plan\r\nshould be carried out. [105] Accordingly, an agreement was made with\r\nhim on the above basis. He was to take the men at his own expense,\r\nwith commission and papers from the governor for affairs of government\r\nand war, and provisions from the Audiencia for the administration of\r\njustice. He began preparing ships, men, and provisions, in order to\r\nsail as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Governor Don Francisco Tello despatched Don Joan\r\nde Çamudio with a moderate-sized ship to Great China to obtain leave\r\nfrom the viceroy of Canton for the Spaniards to communicate and\r\ntrade with his province. He was also to fetch saltpeter and metals\r\nwhich were wanted for the royal magazines of Manila. Don Joan reached\r\nhis destination with good weather, and after stationing himself off\r\nthe coast of Canton, sent certain of his company to the city with\r\ndespatches for the tuton or viceroy. When the viceroy heard of the\r\narrival of the Spaniards and the reason thereof, he gave them audience,\r\nand treated them cordially. The Portuguese residing in Macan near the\r\ncity of Canton, made many efforts to prevent the viceroy, the conchifu,\r\nand other mandarins from admitting the Castilians of Manila into\r\ntheir country, alleging that the latter were pirates and evil-doers,\r\nwho seized upon whatever kingdom and province they visited. They told\r\nthem so many things that it would have sufficed to destroy them, had\r\nnot the viceroy and mandarins looked at the matter dispassionately;\r\nfor they knew the declaration of the Portuguese to be hate and enmity,\r\nand that these passions moved them to desire that the Castilians\r\nhave no trade with China, for their own interests. The affair went so\r\nfar, that, having been brought before a court of justice, silence was\r\nimposed upon the Portuguese of Macan, under penalty of severe corporal\r\npunishment; while the Castilians were given and assigned a port on\r\nthe same coast, named El Pinal [Pine Grove], twelve leguas from the\r\ncity of Canton, where they might then and always enter and make a\r\nsettlement of their own; and they were given sufficient chapas [i.e.,\r\nedicts or passports of safety] and provisions therefor. Thereupon\r\nDon Joan de Çamudio, entered El Pinal with his ship and there he was\r\nfurnished with everything needful by the Chinese at a moderate price\r\nwhile the Spaniards went to and fro on the river upon their business\r\nto Canton in lorchas [106] and champans. While the Spaniards were\r\ndetained, in the said port they were always well received in the city\r\nand lodged in houses within its walls. They went about the streets\r\nfreely and armed, a thing which is new and unique in China in respect\r\nto foreigners. This caused so great wonder and envy to the Portuguese\r\n(who are not so treated) that they tried with might and main to\r\nprevent it, even going so far as to come by night in boats from Macan\r\nto El Pinal to fire the ship of the Castilians. This did not succeed,\r\nhowever, for, having been heard, the necessary resistance was made,\r\nand after that a good watch was always kept on board, until the ship\r\nhaving accomplished its business and object departed thence, much to\r\nthe satisfaction of the Chinese, who gave the Spaniards chapas and\r\ndocuments for the future. The ship reached Manila at the beginning\r\nof the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine.\r\n\r\nAfter Don Luys Dasmariñas had equipped two moderate-sized ships and\r\na galliot, and collected two hundred men who chose to follow him\r\nin this enterprise to Camboja--they were part of the unemployed in\r\nManila--with the necessary provisions, ammunition, and equipment on\r\nhis ships; and accompanied by Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Aduarte\r\nof the Order of St. Dominic and Fray Joan Bautista of the Order of\r\nSt. Francis, some Japanese, and native Indians of Manila: he set sail\r\nwith his fleet from the bay, in the middle of July, [107] of the year\r\nninety-eight. The weather was somewhat contrary as the seasons of\r\nthe vendavals had set in, but his desire to accomplish his voyage,\r\nlose no time, and leave Manila, which was the greatest difficulty,\r\ncaused him to disregard the weather; he thought that, once at sea,\r\nhe would be able to stop on the coast in the port of Bolinao.\r\n\r\nThis plan did not succeed so well as Don Luis had anticipated, for, as\r\nsoon as the fleet of these three ships left the bay it was so buffeted\r\nby the weather that it could not fetch the port of Bolinao or hold\r\nthe sea. The flagship sprung a leak, and the ships returned to the\r\nmouth of the bay above Miraveles, [108] where they stayed several days\r\nrefitting. When the weather moderated they set sail again, but again\r\nthey were buffeted so violently that the ships were separated from\r\none another, and the galliot--the weakest of them--with difficulty\r\nmade the port of Cagayan. Quite dismantled and very necessitous,\r\nit entered by the bar of Camalayuga to the city of Segovia, which is\r\nat the head of the island of Luzon opposite Great China. There the\r\nalcalde-mayor of that province furnished it the necessary provisions\r\nand tackle. Captain Luis Ortiz, who commanded this galliot, together\r\nwith twenty-five Spaniards and some Indians, hastened preparations for\r\ntheir departure and again left that port to rejoin the fleet which\r\nhe had to follow, according to his instructions, making for the bar\r\nof the river of Camboja which was their destination. He had scarcely\r\nleft Cagayan, when the almiranta entered the port in the same distress\r\nas the galliot. It was also detained some days to refit. Then it left\r\nagain to rejoin the flagship and the galliot. The flagship being a\r\nstronger vessel kept the sea with difficulty; and as the storm lasted\r\na long time, it was compelled to run in the open toward China. The\r\nstorm continued to rage so steadily that, without being able to\r\nmeliorate its voyage, the ship was obliged to sail, amid high seas\r\nand cloudy weather, to certain small uninhabited islands on the coast\r\nof China below Macan. There it was many times in danger of shipwreck,\r\nand parts of the cargo were thrown away daily. The almiranta, after\r\nhaving been refitted, left Cagayan, made the same voyage in the same\r\nstorm, and anchored near the flagship, where it was lost with some\r\nmen and its entire cargo. [109]The flagship did its best to rescue\r\nthose who escaped from the almiranta, and although the former kept\r\nafloat several days, at length it grounded near the coast. There\r\nit began to leak so badly that, with that and the strong sea which\r\nstruck it broadside, the vessel went to pieces. The ship's boat had\r\nalready been lost, and in order to save their lives before the ship\r\nwas completely wrecked they were obliged to make rafts and prepare\r\nframework and planks on which Don Luis and the religious and crew--in\r\nall one hundred and twenty Spaniards--went ashore. They brought away\r\nfrom the said ship a few of the most valuable objects, the weapons,\r\nand the most manageable pieces of artillery, abandoning the rest as\r\nlost. All of the Spaniards were so soaked and in so ill a plight that\r\nsome Chinese who came to the coast, from some neighboring towns, both\r\nfrom compassion felt for their loss and on account of having been given\r\ncertain things that had been brought away from the wreck, provided\r\nthem with food and with a native vessel of small burden in which to\r\nleave that place and make for Macan and Canton, which were not far.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Don Luis and his men sighted Macan, the former sent two\r\nsoldiers of his company in Chinese vessels to the city and settlement\r\nof the Portuguese to announce their arrival and hardships, in order to\r\nobtain some help from them. He sent two other soldiers to Canton to\r\nask the viceroy or tuton for assistance and protection, so that they\r\nmight equip themselves in, and sail from, China, in prosecution of\r\ntheir voyage. The people of Macan and their chief captain Don Pablo\r\nof Portugal received the Castilians so ill that they were thrown\r\ninto prison and not allowed to return to Don Luis. To the latter they\r\nsent word warning him to leave the coast immediately, as they would\r\ntreat them all no less ill. When the Portuguese learned that Captain\r\nHernando de los Rios [110] and one of his companions had gone to Canton\r\nfor the same purpose, they at once sent two Portuguese, members of\r\ntheir council and magistracy [camara and regimiento] to oppose their\r\nentry into China, by saying that they were robbers and pirates, and\r\nevil-doers, as they had said before of Don Joan de Çamudio, who at\r\nthis time was with his ship in the port of El Pinal, as abovesaid.\r\n\r\nIn Canton, Captain Hernando de los Rios and his companion met Alferez\r\nDomingo de Artacho and other companions belonging to Don Joan's ship,\r\nwho, on learning of the disaster of Don Luis's fleet and that it had\r\nbeen wrecked near by, came together and defended themselves against the\r\ncalumnies and pretensions of the Portuguese. The result was that, as\r\nthe main difficulty had been already overcome in the case of Don Joan,\r\nand the viceroy and mandarins were informed that all were from Manila,\r\nwho Don Luis Dasmariñas was, and that he was going to Camboja with\r\nhis fleet, they received him with the same good-will with which they\r\nhad received Don Joan de Çamudio, and gave him permission to enter\r\nthe port of E1 Pinal with him. There the two met, with much regret\r\nby the one at Don Luis Dasmariñas's loss, and with much satisfaction\r\nby the other at finding there Don Joan de Çamudio and his men, who\r\nprovided them with certain things that they needed. With Don Joan's\r\nassistance, Don Luis at once bought a strong, moderate-sized junk,\r\non which he embarked with some of his men, and the artillery and\r\ngoods which had been saved. He enjoyed the same advantages in that\r\nport as the Spaniards of Don Joan de Çamudio's ship. He intended to\r\nremain there until, having sent news to Manila, ships and the other\r\nnecessary things for pursuing his voyage thence to Camboja, should\r\nbe sent him, in respect to which Don Luis would never allow himself\r\nto show any discouragement or loss of resolution.\r\n\r\nDon Joan de Çamudio left El Pinal, leaving Don Luis Dasmariñas and\r\nhis men in that port, at the beginning of the year ninety-nine,\r\nand reached Manila in twelve days. After him, Don Luis sent Alférez\r\nFrancisco Rodrigues with three companions to Manila in a small champan\r\nto beg the governor and his supporters for help and assistance in\r\nhis present emergency, a vessel, and what was needful to continue the\r\nexpedition that he had begun. In Manila the news of Don Luis's loss\r\nand of the conditions to which he was reduced, was learned both from\r\nDon Joan de Çamudio and from Alférez Francisco Rodrigues, who reached\r\nManila after the former. Seeing that it was impossible for Don Luis to\r\ncontinue the voyage to Camboja, and that there was neither property\r\nnor substance with which to equip him again, nor the time for it,\r\na moderate-sized ship was purchased and despatched from Manila to\r\nE1 Pinal with provisions and other things, under command of the same\r\nAlférez Francisco Rodrigues, who was accompanied by some soldiers of\r\nwhom he was captain and leader. Through them Don Francisco Tello sent\r\norders to Don Luis to embark his men and return to the Filipinas,\r\nwithout thinking for the present of the expedition to Camboja or of\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hernando de los Rios, who attended to Don Luis's affairs in\r\nCanton, wrote a letter at this time to Doctor Antonio de Morga; and\r\nin order that what happened in this respect may be better understood,\r\nthe letter reads word for word as follows.\r\n\r\nFernando de los Rios Coronel, to Doctor Antonio de Morga, of\r\nhis Majesty's council, and his auditor in the royal Audiencia\r\nand Chancillería of the Filipinas, whom may our Lord preserve, in\r\nManila. The hardships which have befallen us within the short time\r\nsince we left Manila, have been so many, that, if I were to give your\r\nGrace an account of them all, it would weary you; moreover the short\r\ntime in which Don Joan is to depart does not allow of it. And since\r\nhe will relate everything fully, I will relate only what occurred to\r\nus after reaching this land; for our Lord was pleased to change our\r\nintentions, which were to remain in Bolinao until the bad weather\r\nwhich we were having had terminated. In sight of the port we were\r\novertaken by a storm which greatly endangered our lives and forced\r\nus to come to this kingdom of China, where we expected at least\r\nthat the Portuguese would allow us to refit our ship. As it was the\r\nLord's will that we should lose it, we have suffered hardships enough,\r\nfor scarcely anything was saved. I lost my property and a portion of\r\nthat of others, because I was not present at the time of the wreck,\r\nas my general ordered myself and a coast-pilot the day before to go\r\nto look for fresh provisions. This coast is so wretchedly laid down\r\non the charts that we did not know where we were, and on account\r\nof bad weather I could not return to the ship. Consequently I was\r\nobliged to go to Canton, where the Sangleys, who conveyed me and\r\nthose who left the ship with me, accused us of having killed three\r\nSangleys. And had we not found there Alférez Domingo de Artacho\r\nand Marcos de la Cueva, who were pleading against the Portuguese,\r\nwe would have fared very ill. It was God's will, that, with their\r\naid, we settled the case in court; and, although without proofs, and\r\nwithout taking our depositions, they condemned us to a fine of fifty\r\ntaes of silver. There we learned that for one and one-half months they\r\n[i.e., the men of Juan Zamudio's vessel] had been defending themselves\r\nagainst the Portuguese, who, as soon as the Spaniards had arrived,\r\nwent about saying that they were robbers and rebels, and people who\r\nseized the kingdoms into which they entered, and other things not\r\nworth writing. But in the end, all their efforts, good and evil--and\r\nindeed very evil--profited them nothing, because, by means of great\r\nassiduity and a quantity of silver, the Spaniards negotiated a matter\r\nwhich the Portuguese had never imagined, namely, the opening of a\r\nport in this country, in order that the Spaniards might always come\r\nsafely, and the granting of houses in Canton, a privilege which was\r\nnever extended to the Portuguese, on account of which the latter are,\r\nor will be, even more angered. Besides, silence was imposed upon the\r\nPortuguese, although this was no part of the negotiations, so that they\r\nmight not attempt by other means to do us all the injury possible (as\r\nthe Sangleys who were among them tell us). It is impossible to tell\r\nhow much the Portuguese abhor the name of Castilians, unless it be\r\nexperienced as we have done for our sins, for they have placed us in\r\ngreat extremity, as Don Joan will relate fully. For, when our general\r\nwrote to them that we had been wrecked, and were dying of hunger among\r\ninfidels, and in great peril, and that he was not coming to trade,\r\nbut was engaged in the service of his Majesty, the welcome given him\r\nby the Portuguese was to seize his messengers and keep them up to the\r\npresent time in a dungeon. Lastly, while we have been in this port,\r\nundergoing the difficulties and perils which Don Joan will relate,\r\nalthough they are so near, not only do they leave us to suffer, but,\r\nif there are any well-disposed persons, they have forbidden them to\r\ncommunicate with us or to give us anything, under both temporal and\r\nspiritual penalty. In truth, to reflect upon this cruelty, and still\r\nmore to experience it as we are doing, exhausts all patience. May God\r\nin His mercy give us patience and consolation because these infidels\r\n[i.e., the Chinese] are the people who have corrupted the natural\r\nlight more than any other people in the world. Hence angels and not men\r\nare required to deal with them. Since there are historians who record\r\nevents in these regions, I shall not go into details respecting them. I\r\nonly say, in order that you may understand in what a country we are,\r\nthat it is the true kingdom of the devil, where he seems to rule with\r\nfull power. Hence each Sangley appears to be the devil incarnate,\r\nfor there is no malice or deceit which they do not attempt. Although\r\noutwardly the government, with all its order and method, seems good\r\nas far as its preservation is concerned, yet, in practice, it is all\r\na scheme of the devil. Although here they do not rob or plunder the\r\nforeigners openly, yet they do it by other and worse methods. Don\r\nJoan has worked hard, and gratitude is certainly due him, for he has\r\naccomplished a thing so difficult, that the Portuguese say only the\r\ndevil or he could have done it. However, it is true that it has cost\r\nhim, as I have heard, about seven thousand pesos, besides the risk to\r\nwhich he has been exposed; for the Portuguese attempted to burn him in\r\nhis ship; and although their schemes came to naught, it is impossible\r\nto describe the bitterness which they feel at seeing us come here to\r\ntrade, because of the signal injury they receive thereby. However,\r\nif one considers it thoroughly, the truth is that, if this business\r\nwere established on the basis of a fair agreement, the Portuguese\r\nwould rather gain by it, because they would dispose of innumerable\r\narticles that they possess, and the majority of them, especially the\r\npoor, would profit by selling the work of their hands, and what they\r\nget from India, for which they always obtain a good price. As far\r\nas raising the price of [Chinese] merchandise to them is concerned,\r\nonce established, and if the Sangleys understood that ships would come\r\nevery year, they would bring down much more merchandise: and so much\r\nthe more as Canton possesses such a large quantity of it, that there\r\nis more than enough for twice as many as are here, as we have seen\r\nwith our own eyes. I can testify that, if they wish to load a ship\r\nwith only one kind of goods, they can do so, even if it be needles;\r\nthe more so, since the greater part of what the Chinese consume is\r\nnot included among our articles of purchase, the great bulk of our\r\npurchases being raw silk. Therefore I believe that the continuation\r\nof this would be of great advantage to that city [i.e., Manila] for\r\nthe following reasons which present themselves to me. The first is\r\nthat, if orders were given for a ship to come authorized to invest\r\nthe bulk of the money of that city [i.e., Manila], much more and\r\nbetter goods could be bought with much less money, and in articles\r\nwhich would prove more profitable; since, in short, we would save\r\nwhat the people of Chincheo gain with us [at Manila]--a goodly sum.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that that city [i.e., Manila] would be provided\r\nwith all necessaries, because one can find in the city of Canton\r\nanything that can be desired.\r\n\r\nThe third is that by this means we would avoid the excessive commerce\r\nof the Sangleys in that city [i.e., Manila], who cause the harm which\r\nyour Grace knows, and even that which we do not know. They are people\r\nwho, the less they are admitted, the better will it be for us in every\r\nrespect. Hence there is no need of there being more of them than the\r\nnumber required for the service of the community; and then they would\r\nneither raise the price of provisions, nor retail what remains in the\r\ncountry, as they do now. Thus many pernicious sins which they commit\r\nand teach to the natives would be avoided. Although there seems to\r\nbe some difficulty in establishing this and in smoothing down the\r\nPortuguese, still it might be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe fourth reason is that, if the purchase is made here, it will\r\nreach that city [i.e., Manila] by Christmas, and each man would store\r\nhis property in his house, and prepare and arrange it; and then, even\r\nshould the ships from Castilla arrive early, no loss would be suffered\r\nas at present--when, if those ships arrive before the goods purchased\r\nfrom China [reach Manila] the merchandise rises a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nThe fifth reason is that the ships might easily take in cargo any\r\ntime in the month of May, and take advantage of the first vendavals,\r\nwhich sometimes begin by the middle of June or before. By sailing then,\r\nthey run less risk, and will reach Nueva España one month or even two\r\nmonths earlier. Then, they can leave that country in January and come\r\nhere [i.e., to the Filipinas] by April without any of the dangers\r\nwhich beset them among these islands if they sail late, as we know.\r\n\r\nThe sixth reason is that the many inconveniences now existing at the\r\ntime of the purchase [in Manila] would be avoided--inconveniences\r\nwith which your Grace is acquainted--and the citizens would have\r\nless trouble. Also in respect to the lading and its allotment [i.e.,\r\nof shipping room] a better system could certainly be followed,\r\nand it would be known who is to share in it. Things would be better\r\nremedied, because neither the money of Mexico nor that of companies\r\nwould be allowed to be employed. The strict prevention of this alone\r\nwould be sufficient to assure prosperity to Manila in a short time;\r\nfor, if only the inhabitants were to send their invested property,\r\nit is certain that all the machinery of the money of the Mexicans\r\nwould have to be employed on the goods sent from here--I mean from\r\nManila--if they do not allow the Mexicans to purchase in that city\r\n[i.e., Manila]. And if less merchandise is sent from here [i.e.,\r\nChina, and consequently Manila] and there are more buyers there [i.e.,\r\nin Mexico], the goods would be worth double. This is self-evident,\r\nand if, as your Graces have already begun to remedy this matter,\r\nthe measure be rigorously carried still farther, that city [i.e.,\r\nManila] must prosper greatly. For, by not sending to Nueva España\r\nany other produce except that from that city [i.e., Manila] mainly\r\npurchased in this country [i.e., China], Manila would prosper as\r\ngreatly as one could desire. If we consider the benefit and favor\r\nwhich his Majesty confers upon us in this matter, we would esteem\r\nit much more than we do now. But I believe that we shall regret it,\r\nwhen, perchance, we are deprived of it. Perhaps some one would say,\r\nin opposition to what I have said about coming to purchase here,\r\nthat his Majesty would be defrauded of the customs and duties\r\nwhich the Sangleys now pay, and of their tribute. But there is a\r\nremedy for all this, for with the freight duties alone his Majesty\r\nwould save much more; as also by buying ammunitions here and other\r\narticles which he needs for the conservation of that country [i.e.,\r\nthe islands] twice as cheaply and abundantly, and without depending\r\non the Chinese to bring them at their leisure, who at times--and\r\nindeed every year--leave us without them, since we are forced to go\r\nto get them. As far as the tribute is concerned, I believe that his\r\nMajesty would be better served if there were no Sangleys there at all,\r\nthan by receiving the tribute. And it might happen, through this way,\r\nif our Lord ordered it, that a door might be opened for the preaching\r\nof the gospel and for the conversion of the people, a thing desired so\r\nearnestly by his Majesty, and especially aimed at by him. After all,\r\nthings require a beginning, and the road would be opened, although\r\nat present it seems shut; for, if we hope that the Portuguese attempt\r\nthis, I do not know when they will do it, considering that they have\r\nnot tried to do so, for so long as they have been settled here. Even\r\nthe Sangleys say that the Portuguese began like ourselves. At first\r\nthey went to and fro; then two sick men remained; the next year they\r\nbuilt four houses; and thus they continued to increase. I know that\r\nthere is no other difficulty for us to do likewise than that which\r\nthe Portuguese offer. To return to the Portuguese opposition, it is\r\nsomething amazing, for not only are they vexed at our coming here,\r\nbut also at our going to Camboja or to Sian. They assert that those\r\ndistricts are theirs, but I cannot see why they so designate them--for\r\nit is just the contrary--unless it be because we have allowed them,\r\nthrough our negligence, to seize our possessions near the strait of\r\nMalaca, and enter the line of demarcation falling to the crown of\r\nCastilla, as I would make them fully understand if an opportunity were\r\npresented. One can read in Historia de las Indias [111] [i.e., History\r\nof the Indias] in the one hundred and second chapter, and before and\r\nafter it, that, at the request of the Portuguese, his Holiness drew the\r\nsaid line from three hundred and seventy leguas west of the islands of\r\nCaboverde, which were called the Espericas. The one hundred and eighty\r\ndegrees of longitude falling to the Portuguese terminate and end as\r\nabovesaid, near the above-mentioned strait. All the rest belongs to\r\nus. Furthermore, since we are subjects of one king, how do we suffer\r\nthem to forbid us all our trade? Why do they bar us from Maluco, Sian,\r\nCamboja, Cochinchina, China, and all the rest of this archipelago? What\r\nare we to do then, if they wish to seize everything? Surely this is\r\na very unreasonable proceeding. I have dwelt on this matter in order\r\nto express my feelings. Not until our departure shall I write to\r\nyour Grace about the fertility and nature of the country, and of its\r\ngreatness. Then I shall endeavor to give a full account of the land,\r\nand to mark out this coast, for nothing is put down correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is the best coast [112] of all that have been discovered,\r\nand the most suitable for galleys, if God should ordain that they\r\ncome hither. I have already discovered where the king keeps his\r\ntreasure. The country is very rich, and the city of Canton well\r\nsupplied, although there is nothing to be said in regard to its\r\nbuildings, of which the whole city possesses few of any importance,\r\naccording to the information received from a Theatin [113] Sangley with\r\nwhom I found much pleasure in talking--though I was able to do so for\r\nonly one afternoon. He was a man of intelligence and reason, and it is\r\nsaid that he is a scholar. He told me that in Paquien [i.e., Pekin],\r\nwhere the king resides, and in Lanquien [i.e., Nankin] the fathers\r\nof the Society enjoy the quiet possession of three houses. There\r\nare seven fathers, among whom is one called Father Riçio, [114]\r\nan associate of Father Rugero who went to Roma. He is an excellent\r\nmathematician and has corrected the Chinese calendar which contained\r\nmany errors and false opinions, and their fantastic idea of the world,\r\nwhich they believed to be flat. He made them a globe and a sphere,\r\nand with this and the sound arguments and reasons which they give\r\nthem, the fathers are considered as people descended from heaven. He\r\nsays that in those regions the people would be very favorable to\r\nconversion, if there were ministers; and that there [i.e., in Pekin]\r\nthe foreigners are not looked upon with wonder as they are here\r\n[i.e., in Canton]. He says that the people are much more sensible\r\nand reasonable, so much so that they call the people of this country\r\nbarbarians. He adds that Lanquien lies in the latitude of Toledo,\r\nnamely thirty and two-thirds degrees, and that from there to Paquien\r\nis a twenty-five days' journey, so that the latter city must lie in\r\nmore than fifty degrees of latitude. [115] The above-mentioned brother\r\ncomes down annually to collect the stipend given them by the people\r\nhere for their three houses. Now they are expecting a great friend of\r\ntheirs who is said to be the second person nearest to the king. One\r\ncan travel through all this land by water, and therefore it abounds\r\nin everything, for articles are conveyed over the rivers and there\r\nis no need of beasts of burden, which is its special greatness.\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to depict China without having seen the land, must draw\r\na country full of rivers and towns, and without a palmo of ground left\r\nlying idle. I wish I had more time in which to describe some of the\r\nthings of China which I have observed and inquired about with special\r\ncare, and of which, if God please, I shall be the messenger. The\r\naffairs of Camboja are in a good condition, and we shall arrive there\r\nat a seasonable time, if it be our Lord's will that we leave this\r\nplace with good auspices. The king sent a ship to Manila at the end\r\nof August to ask for assistance. I do not know whether it has arrived\r\nor whether it returned to put in port, for it left very late. Bias\r\nRuis sent fifty picos [116] from Camanguian. According to report,\r\nthe king has apportioned and given him nine thousand vassals, and as\r\nmany more to Belloso.\r\n\r\nAt present we ourselves are enduring the necessity of which Don Juan\r\nÇamudio will inform you. I entreat your Grace to help us, since it\r\nis of so great importance. I kiss many times the hand of my lady\r\nDoña Joana. May our Lord preserve your Grace for many years in the\r\nprosperity and tranquillity which we your servants desire. From the\r\nport of El Pinal, frozen with cold, the twenty-third of December,\r\nninety-eight.\r\n\r\nIf my brother should come before I return, I beseech your Grace,\r\nsince it is so natural in your Grace to do good to all--especially\r\nto those of that land--to show him the goodness which your Grace has\r\nalways shown me.\r\n\r\nFERNANDO DE LOS RIOS CORONEL\r\n\r\nAfter Don Juan de Çamudio's departure from El Pinal, where Don Luis\r\nDasmariñas remained with his junk awaiting the assistance that he\r\nexpected from Manila and which he had requested through Don Joan and\r\nAlférez Francisco Rodrigues, Don Luis thought that, since some time had\r\npassed, the answer was being delayed, while his people were suffering\r\ngreat want and cold there. Therefore he tried to put out to sea in the\r\njunk, and to make for Manila. But the weather did not permit this,\r\nnor was the vessel large enough to hold all of Don Luis's men for\r\nthe voyage. He stopped near the fort where the Portuguese of Macan\r\nagain sent him many messages and requests to leave the coast at once,\r\nwarning him that they would seize him and his companions, and would\r\nsend them to India, where they would be severely punished. Don Luis\r\nalways answered them that he had not come to harm or offend them,\r\nbut that he was going to the kingdom of Camboja for the service of\r\nGod and of his Majesty; that he had been shipwrecked and had suffered\r\nmany hardships, the severest of which had been due to the Portuguese\r\nof Macan themselves, subjects of his Majesty; that he was expecting\r\nhelp from Manila in order that he might return thither; and that he\r\nbegged and requested them to aid and protect him, and to free the\r\ntwo Castilians whom they had seized. Finally he declared that if, in\r\nspite of all this, they should attempt to do him any harm or injury, he\r\nwould defend himself to the best of his ability; and he protested that\r\nany losses resulting therefrom would lie at their door. Thenceforward\r\nDon Luis Dasmariñas kept strict watch on his ship. He kept his weapons\r\nready and the artillery loaded, and was on his guard day and night. And\r\nhe was not mistaken, for the people of Macan resolved to attack him in\r\norder to seize him. To this end the chief captain himself came one day,\r\nwith some fustas and other vessels, and with men armed with javelins,\r\nguns, and artillery, when they thought the Castilians would be off\r\ntheir guard, to attack Don Luis Dasmariñas. The latter, suspecting\r\nwhat was about to happen, awaited them arms in hand; and as he saw\r\nthe Portuguese fleet attacking him, he began to play upon them with\r\nhis muskets, arquebuses, and a few pieces of artillery, with such\r\nrapidity that he inflicted a very severe loss upon his enemy and\r\nupon the ship which carried the chief captain, killing one of his\r\npages who stood behind him, and other persons. The chief captain\r\nretired with all the other vessels, and they made for the high sea,\r\nhaving been defeated by Don Luis, who did not attempt to follow them\r\nbut remained on the watch. As the Portuguese did not dare attack him\r\nagain they made for Macan, and Don Luis Dasmariñas put into the port\r\nof El Pinal, where he thought he would be in greater security. There\r\nDon Luis remained until Captain Francisco Rodrigues arrived with the\r\nship from Manila, and joined him. They distributed their men between\r\nthe two ships and made some purchases with what this last ship had\r\nbrought from Manila, in the very city of Macan, for the Portuguese,\r\nfor the sake of their own interests, gave and sold them goods, in\r\nspite of a certain apprehension of the law. They returned to Manila\r\nleaving a few men in El Pinal who had died of sickness, among whom was\r\nFray Alonso Ximenez, the principal promoter of this enterprise. His\r\nassociate, Fray Diego Aduarte, did not choose to return to Manila,\r\nbut went to Macan and thence to Goa, in order to go to España. Don\r\nLuis reached Manila with both ships, and his expedition to Camboja\r\nand his conduct of the said enterprise remained in this state.\r\n\r\nIt has been already related that the galliot, one of the ships of\r\nDon Luis Dasmariñas's fleet, in which Luis Ortiz and twenty-five\r\nSpaniards had sailed, after having put into Cagayan and refitted\r\nthere, sailed again during fairly good weather to find the fleet. This\r\nship although so inadequate to resist storms at sea, was permitted,\r\nthrough God's mercy, to encounter those which it met without being\r\nwrecked. It made its way along the coast of Cochinchina and Champan,\r\ninside the shoals of Aynao, and reached the bar of Camboja. Expecting\r\nto find all or some of the ships of its convoy within the bar, it\r\nascended the river as far as the city of Chordemuco. There they\r\nfound Diego Belloso and Blas Ruys de Hernan Gonçalez, with some\r\nCastilians who had joined them, and other Portuguese who had come by\r\nway of Malaca, and with whose assistance many battles had been won\r\nin favor of King Prauncar, who had been restored to his kingdom,\r\nalthough some of his provinces had not been entirely pacified. It\r\nwas learned there that neither Don Luis Dasmariñas nor any other of\r\nhis fleet had reached Camboja. Those in the galliot said that Don\r\nLuis was coming in person with a large force of ships, men, arms,\r\nand some religious, to accomplish what he had always desired to do\r\nin that kingdom; that he would not be long in coming; and that their\r\ngalliot and crew belonged to his fleet. Blas Ruis and his Castilian\r\ncompanions greatly rejoiced over so opportune news. The former thought\r\nthat everything was turning out well, and that now, according to the\r\npresent state of affairs, matters would be accomplished and settled as\r\nthey wished. Diego Belloso and his party, although they did not show\r\ntheir regret, were not so pleased, for they much preferred the happy\r\ntermination and reward of this expedition to be for the Portuguese and\r\nthe government of India. They had had certain quarrels and disputes\r\nwith Blas Ruis over this. But seeing that the affair had reached this\r\nstate, they conformed to the times. Thereupon all joined together,\r\nPortuguese and Castilians, and informed Prauncar and his mandarins\r\nof the arrival of Alférez Luis Ortiz with his galliot and companions,\r\nsaying that they were part of a large fleet which would shortly arrive,\r\nand that Don Luis Dasmariñas was coming in it in person, with religious\r\nand men to aid and serve the king, in conformity to what he himself\r\nhad requested in his letter to Manila, several months before. The\r\nking seemed pleased at this, and so did some of his mandarins who\r\nliked the Spaniards, and recognized what benefits they had derived\r\nfrom them hitherto. These believed that the matter would turn out\r\nas it was represented to them. But the king's stepmother, and other\r\nmandarins of her party, especially the Moro Malay Ocuña Lacasamana,\r\nwere vexed at the arrival of the Spaniards, for they thought that\r\nthe latter, being valiant men, numerous, and so courageous, as they\r\nalready knew, would dominate everything, or at least would take the\r\nbest; moreover they alone wished to deal with King Prauncar. Thus\r\ntheir aversion for Spanish affairs became known to be as great as\r\nthe favor with which Prauncar, on the contrary, regarded them. The\r\nlatter immediately assigned the Spaniards a position with their ship\r\nnear the city, at the place which Blas Ruiz and Diego Belloso occupied.\r\n\r\nBefore Don Luis Dasmariñas left Manila with his fleet, Captain Joan\r\nde Mendoça Gamboa requested Governor Don Francisco Tello to allow him\r\nto go to the kingdom of Sian with a moderate-sized ship, in order to\r\ntrade. For the greater security of his voyage and business, he asked\r\nthe governor to give him letters to the king of Sian, in which the\r\nlatter should be informed that he was sent as the governor's ambassador\r\nand messenger to continue the peace, friendship, and commerce which\r\nJoan Tello de Aguirre had contracted with Sian the year before. Seeing\r\nthat Don Luis Dasmariñas, who was on the way to Camboja, had left in\r\nManila for another occasion some ammunition and other things of use\r\nto his fleet, Don Joan, in order better to facilitate the granting of\r\nhis request, offered to take these stores on board his ship and sail\r\nround by way of Camboja, where he supposed that he would find Don\r\nLuis Dasmariñas, and deliver them to him. The governor thought the\r\ntwo proposals timely, and having furnished him with the necessary\r\ndespatches, Don Joan de Mendoça left Manila with his ship, taking\r\nas pilot Joan Martinez de Chave, who had been Joan Tello's pilot\r\nwhen the latter went to Sian. He took as companions some sailors and\r\nIndian natives. He had a quantity of siguei [117] and other goods to\r\nbarter, and the ammunition and provisions which he was to convey to\r\nDon Luis. With him embarked Fray Joan Maldonado [118] and an associate,\r\nboth religious of the Order of St. Dominic. The former was a grave and\r\nlearned man and a very intimate friend of Don Luis Dasmariñas, to whom\r\nhis order took great pleasure in sending him as a companion. They left\r\nManila, without knowing of Don Luis's shipwreck two months after the\r\nlatter had set sail. Crossing over the shoals they shortly reached\r\nthe bar of Camboja and ascended to the capital, where they found\r\nthe galliot of the fleet and learned that its other ships had not\r\narrived. The king received them cordially and lodged them with Diego\r\nBelloso, Blas Ruiz, Luis Ortiz, and their companions. They passed\r\nthe time together, and would not let Joan de Mendoça leave Camboja\r\nwith his ship until something was heard of Don Luis Dasmariñas. A few\r\ndays later, they learned through Chinese ships, and by other means,\r\nthat the latter had put into China with difficulty and in distress,\r\nand that he was there preparing to continue his voyage. Although this\r\nevent caused them sorrow, they still hoped that in a short time Don\r\nLuis would be in Camboja with the two ships of his fleet.\r\n\r\nAt this same time, a mestizo, named Govea, son of a Portuguese\r\nand a Japanese woman, who lived in Japon, collected some mestizo\r\ncompanions, as well as Japanese and Portuguese, on a junk which\r\nhe owned in the port of Nangasaqui, with the intention of coasting\r\nalong China, Champan, and Camboja, to seek adventures and to barter,\r\nbut mainly to make prizes of what they might meet at sea. With them\r\nembarked a Castilian who had lived in Nangasaqui after the wreck of\r\nthe galleon \"San Felipe,\" while on its way to Nueva España in the\r\nyear ninety-six. His name was Don Antonio Malaver, and he had been\r\na soldier in Italia. He came to the Filipinas from Nueva España as\r\ncaptain and sargento-mayor of the troops brought that year by Doctor\r\nAntonio de Morga in the fleet from Nueva España to Manila. Don Antonio\r\nMalaver, who had no wish to return to the Filipinas, thinking that\r\nby that way he could go to India and thence to España, and that on\r\nthe road there might fall to him some share of the illgotten gains\r\nof that voyage, embarked with Govea and his company. After they had\r\nrun down the coast and heard some news of the entry of Spaniards\r\ninto Camboja, Don Antonio persuaded Govea to enter the river of\r\nCamboja, where they would find Spaniards, and affairs in such a\r\nstate that they might take some effective action in that kingdom,\r\nand thrive better than at sea. They went up as far as Chordemuco,\r\njoined the Castilians and Portuguese and were received into their\r\ncompany and list. As they all--and they were a considerable number of\r\nmen--saw the delay of Don Luis Dasmariñas, they proclaimed as leaders\r\nFray Joan Maldonado, Diego Belloso, and Blas Ruis. Then they began\r\nto treat with King Prauncar on their own account concerning their\r\nestablishment and comfort, and to request lands and rice for their\r\nmaintenance and other things which had been promised them, alleging\r\nthat they did not derive the necessary usufruct and profit out of\r\nhis concessions to Belloso and Blas Ruis. Although the king gave\r\nthem good hopes for everything he brought nothing to a conclusion,\r\nbeing hindered in this by his stepmother and the mandarins of her\r\nparty, who would have liked to see the Spaniards out of the kingdom;\r\nand in this they gained more animus every day by the non-arrival of\r\nDon Luis Dasmariñas. Consequently, the Spaniards spent the time in\r\ngoing to and fro between their quarters and the city to negotiate\r\nwith the king, with whose answers and conversations they sometimes\r\nreturned satisfied and at other times not so much so.\r\n\r\nOcuña Lacasamana and his Malays had their quarters near those of the\r\nSpaniards, and since they were Moros, so opposed in religion and\r\npretension, the two parties had no affinity. Once a quarrel arose\r\nbetween Spaniards and Malays, and several men were severely wounded on\r\nboth sides. Among them Alférez Luys Ortiz, commander of the galliot,\r\nhad both legs run through and was in great danger. King Prauncar was\r\nangry at this, but did not dare to inflict any punishment or make\r\nany reparation for these injuries. While matters were at such a heat\r\nand the Malays were ill-disposed toward the Spaniards, one day while\r\nFray Joan Maldonado, Diego Belloso, and Blas Ruyz were in the city,\r\nand Luys de Villafañe was in command of the quarters, on account of\r\nthe wounds and illness of Luys Ortiz, another quarrel arose in the\r\nquarters with the Malays. Luys de Villafañe, taking advantage of this\r\nopportunity, determined, with a few Spaniards who followed him, to\r\nunite with Govea and his men, and attack the Malays, their quarters,\r\nand the goods that they possessed, and sack them. Incited by anger and\r\nstill more by covetousness, they carried this out, and after having\r\nkilled many Malays and taken a quantity of property from them, they\r\nretired and fortified themselves in their own quarters and in the\r\nJapanese ship. The king and his mandarins were very angry at this,\r\nand not less so were Fray Joan Maldonado, Belloso, and Blas Ruyz,\r\nwho were in Chordemuco; but Ocuña Lacasamana was far the angriest,\r\nat seeing the injury and insult done him, and at the breaking of the\r\npeace so recently made in reference to former quarrels. Although Fray\r\nJoan Maldonado, Belloso, and Blas Ruiz went at once to the quarters\r\nto remedy the matter, they found it so complicated that not even\r\nKing Prauncar, who tried to intervene, could compose it. The latter\r\nwarned the Spaniards to look to their personal safety, for he saw\r\ntheir party fallen and in great danger, without his being able to\r\nhelp it. Fray Joan Maldonado and his companion, although facing the\r\nmatter in company with Diego Belloso and Bias Ruis, yet took refuge\r\nin Joan de Mendoça's ship for greater security, and some Spaniards\r\ndid the same. Diego Belloso, Blas Ruiz, and the others relying on\r\nthe king's friendship, and their services in the country, remained\r\non shore, although they took every precaution and kept the closest\r\npossible guard over their safety. [119]\r\n\r\nThe Malay Lacasamana, aided by his men and the mandarins of his\r\nparty, and supported by the king's step-mother, lost no more\r\ntime, nor the present opportunity, but attacked the Castilians,\r\nPortuguese, and Japanese, at once, both by land and sea. Finding them\r\nseparated--although some offered as much resistance as possible--he\r\nkilled them all, including Diego Belloso and Blas Ruiz de Hernan\r\nGonçales. Then he burned their quarters and vessels except that of\r\nJoan de Mendoça, who, fearing the danger, descended the river toward\r\nthe sea and defended himself against some praus that had followed\r\nhim. He took with him Fray Joan Maldonado, the latter's associate, and\r\nsome few Spaniards. On shore there remained alive only one Franciscan\r\nreligious, five Manila Indians, and a Castilian named Joan Dias, whom\r\nthe king, who grieved exceedingly for the deaths of the Spaniards,\r\nhad hid carefully in the open country. Although the king advised\r\nthe friar not to appear in public until the Malays were appeased,\r\nthat religious, imagining that he could escape their fury, emerged\r\nwith two Indians in order to escape from the kingdom. But they were\r\nfound and killed like the others. Joan Dias and three Indians remained\r\nmany days in concealment, and the king maintained them, until, after\r\nother events, they could appear. Thus the cause of the Spaniards in\r\nCamboja came to an end, and was so entirely defeated that the Moro\r\nMalay and his partisans remained complete masters. They managed the\r\naffairs of the kingdom with so little respect for King Prauncar,\r\nthat finally they killed him also. Thereupon a fresh insurrection\r\nbroke out, the provinces revolted, each man seized whatever he could,\r\nand there was more confusion and disturbance than before.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish garrison left in La Caldera, at the withdrawal of Don\r\nJoan Ronquillo's camp from the river of Mindanao, passed into command\r\nof Captain Villagra at the death of Captain Joan Pacho in Jolo, and\r\nwas suffering for lack of provisions; for neither the people of the\r\nriver could give them to the Spaniards, nor would the Joloans furnish\r\nany on account of the war declared upon them. Therefore the garrison\r\nurgently requested Governor Don Francisco Tello either to aid their\r\npresidio with provisions, soldiers, and ammunition, or to allow them\r\nto retire to Manila--a thing of which they were most desirous--since\r\nthere they gained no other special result than that of famine, and\r\nof incarceration in that fort, and of no place wherein to seek their\r\nsustenance. The governor, in view of their insistence in the matter;\r\nand having but little money in the royal exchequer, with which to\r\nprovide for and maintain the said presidio--and for the same reason\r\nthe punishment that was to be inflicted upon the Joloans for their\r\noutrages upon the Spaniards, and their insurrection was deferred--and\r\nthinking that the return to Mindanao matters would be a long question:\r\nhe was inclined to excuse the difficulty and anxiety of maintaining\r\nthe presidio of La Caldera. In order to do it with a reasonable\r\nexcuse he consulted the Audiencia and other intelligent persons, and\r\nrequested them to give him their opinion. But he first communicated\r\nhis wishes to them and gave them some reasons with which he tried to\r\npersuade them to give him the answer that he desired. The Audiencia\r\nadvised him not to remove or raise the garrison of La Caldera, but to\r\nreënforce and maintain it, and to attend to the affairs of Jolo and\r\nthe river of Mindanao as soon as possible, even if what was necessary\r\nfor those two places should be withdrawn from some other section. They\r\nsaid that this was the most urgent need, and the one which required\r\nthe greatest attention in the islands, both in order to pacify those\r\nprovinces and to keep them curbed; lest, seeing the Spaniards totally\r\nwithdrawn, they should gain courage and boldly venture still farther,\r\nand come down to make captures among the Pintados and carry the war\r\nto the very doors of the Spaniards. [120] Notwithstanding this reply\r\nthe governor resolved to raise and withdraw the garrison, and sent\r\norders to Captain Villagra immediately to burn the fort which had\r\nbeen built in La Caldera, to withdraw with all his men and ships,\r\nand return to Manila. This was quickly done, for the captain and the\r\nsoldiers of the garrison waited for nothing more than to dismantle\r\nthe fort and leave. When the Joloans saw the Spaniards abandoning the\r\ncountry, they were persuaded that the latter would return to Mindanao\r\nno more, and that they had not sufficient forces to do so. Thereupon\r\nthey gained fresh resolution and courage, and united with the people\r\nof Buhahayen on the river, and equipped a number of caracoas and other\r\ncraft, in order to descend upon the coast of Pintados to plunder them\r\nand make captives. The people of Tampacan, who lost hope of receiving\r\nfurther help from the Spaniards, and of the latter's return to the\r\nriver, since they had also abandoned the fort of La Caldera and left\r\nthe country, came to terms with and joined the people of Buhahayen,\r\ntheir neighbors, in order to avoid the war and injuries that they\r\nwere suffering from the latter. Then all turned their arms against\r\nthe Spaniards, promising themselves to make many incursions into their\r\nterritory and gain much plunder. Accordingly they prepared their fleet,\r\nand appointed as leaders and commanders of it two of the experienced\r\nchiefs, of the river of Mindanao, called Sali and Silonga. They left\r\nthe Mindanao River in the month of July of the year ninety-nine, in\r\nthe season of the vendavals, with fifty caracoas, containing more than\r\nthree thousand soldiers armed with arquebuses, campilans, carasas,\r\nother weapons with handles, and many culverins, and steered toward\r\nthe islands of Oton and Panay, and neighboring islands. They passed\r\nNegros Island and went to the river of Panay, which they ascended\r\nfor five leguas to the chief settlement, where the alcalde-mayor and\r\nsome Spaniards were living. They sacked the settlement, burned the\r\nhouses and churches, captured many native Christians--men, women,\r\nand children--upon whom they committed many murders, cruelties,\r\nand outrages. They pursued these in boats more than ten leguas up\r\nthe river, and destroyed all the crops. For the alcalde-mayor, and\r\nthose who could, fled inland among the mountains, and accordingly the\r\nenemy had a better opportunity to do what they pleased. After they had\r\nburned all the vessels in the river, they left the river of Panay with\r\ntheir boats laden with pillaged goods and captive Christians. They\r\ndid the same in the other islands and towns which they passed. Then\r\nthey returned to Mindanao, without any opposition being offered, with\r\na quantity of gold and goods and more than eight hundred captives,\r\nbesides the people whom they had killed. In Mindanao they divided\r\nthe spoil, and agreed to get ready a larger fleet for the next year,\r\nand return to make war better prepared. [121]\r\n\r\nThis daring attack of the Mindanaos worked great injury to the islands\r\nof Pintados, both on account of their deeds there and also on account\r\nof the fear and terror with which they inspired the natives; because\r\nof the latter being in the power of the Spaniards, who kept them\r\nsubject, tributary, and disarmed, and neither protected them from\r\ntheir enemies, nor left them the means to defend themselves, as they\r\nused to do when there were no Spaniards in the country. Therefore\r\nmany towns of peaceful and subjected Indians revolted and withdrew\r\nto the tingues,  [122] and refused to descend to their houses,\r\nmagistrates, and encomenderos. As was reported daily, they all\r\nhad a great desire to revolt and rebel, but they were appeased and\r\nreduced again to subjection by a few promises and presents from their\r\nencomenderos and religious who showed great pity and sadness over\r\ntheir injuries. Although in Manila people regretted these injuries,\r\nand still more those which were expected in the future from the enemy,\r\nthey did nothing but regret them--since the governor was ill provided\r\nwith ship and other necessities for the defense--and reckon them with\r\nthe loss which they had suffered for having raised the camp on the\r\nriver of Mindanao and dismantled the presidio of La Caldera.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather permitted, the Mindanaos and Joloans returned\r\nwith a large fleet of more than seventy well-equipped ships and more\r\nthan four thousand fighting men, led by the same Silonga and Sali,\r\nand other Mindanao and Jolo chiefs, to the same islands of Pintados,\r\nwith the determination of taking and sacking the Spanish town of\r\nArevalo, which is situated in Oton. Captain Joan Garcia de Sierra,\r\nalcalde-mayor of that province, having heard of this expedition and\r\nof the designs entertained by the enemy, took the most necessary\r\nprecautions, and, gathering into the town all the Spaniards who\r\nlived there and in its neighborhood, shut himself up in it with all\r\nof them. Then, having repaired, as well as possible, a wooden fort\r\nthere, he gathered there the women and their possessions. He and\r\nthe Spaniards--about seventy men--armed with arquebuses, awaited the\r\nenemy. The latter, who intended to attack the river of Panay again,\r\npassed Negros Island and made for the town of Arevalo, where they\r\nanchored close to the native settlement. Then they landed one thousand\r\nfive hundred men armed with arquebuses, campilans, and carasas, and,\r\nwithout stopping on the way marched against the Spanish town which\r\nwas the object of their attack. The Spaniards, divided into troops,\r\nsallied forth and opened fire with their arquebuses upon the enemy\r\nwith such vehemence that they forced them to retreat and take refuge\r\non board their caracoas. So great was the enemy's confusion that many\r\nMindanaos were killed before they could embark. Captain Joan Garcia\r\nde Sierra, who was on horseback, pursued the enemy so closely to the\r\nwater's edge that the latter cut off the legs of his mount with their\r\ncampilans and brought him to the ground where they killed him. The\r\nenemy embarked with a heavy loss of men, and halted at the island of\r\nGuimaraez, [123] in sight of Arevalo. There they counted their men,\r\nincluding the dead and the wounded, who were not a few, and among whom\r\nwas one of the most noted chiefs and leaders. Then they sailed for\r\nMindanao, making a great show of grief and sorrow, and sounding their\r\nbells and tifas. [124] They made no further delay at the Pintados,\r\nderiving little profit or gain from the expedition, but much injury,\r\nand loss of men and reputation, which was felt more deeply upon their\r\narrival in Jolo and Mindanao. In order to remedy this disaster, it\r\nwas proposed to renew their expedition against the Pintados at the\r\nfirst monsoon with more ships and men, and it was so decided.\r\n\r\nWhen the affairs of Japon were discussed above, we spoke of the loss\r\nof the ship \"San Felipe\" in Hurando, in the province of Toca; of the\r\nmartyrdom of the discalced Franciscan religious in Nangasaqui; and of\r\nthe departure of the Spaniards and religious who had remained there,\r\nwith the exception of Fray Geronymo de Jesus, who, changing his habit,\r\nconcealed himself in the interior of the country. We related that\r\nTaicosama, after he had given an answer to the governor of Manila,\r\nthrough his ambassador, Don Luis Navarrete, excusing himself for what\r\nhad happened, was induced, at the instigation of Faranda Quiemon and\r\nhis supporters, to send a fleet against Manila; that he had supplied\r\nFaranda with rice and other provisions in order to despatch it; and\r\nthat the latter had begun preparations, but not having managed to\r\nbring the matter to the point that he had promised, the enterprise\r\nwas dragged on and left in that condition. What happened after these\r\nevents is that Taicosama was seized with a severe sickness in Miaco and\r\ndied, not without having first had time to dispose of the succession\r\nand government of his kingdom, and to see that the empire should be\r\ncontinued in his only son, who was ten years old at that time. For\r\nthis purpose he fixed his choice on the greatest tono in Japon,\r\ncalled Yeyasudono, lord of Quanto--which are certain provinces in\r\nthe north--who had children and grandchildren, and more influence and\r\npower in Japon than any other man in the kingdom. Taicosama summoned\r\nYeyasudono to court, and told him that he wished to marry his son to\r\nthe latter's granddaughter, the daughter of his eldest son, so that\r\nhe might succeed to the empire. The marriage was celebrated, and the\r\ngovernment of Japon left, until his son was older, to Yeyasudono,\r\nassociated with Guenifuin, Fungen, Ximonojo, and Xicoraju, his special\r\nfavorites and counselors, [125] to whose hands the affairs of his\r\ngovernment had passed for some years, in order that thus united they\r\nmight continue to administer them after his death, until his son, whom\r\nhe left named and accepted by the kingdom as his successor and supreme\r\nlord of Japon, was old enough to rule in person. After the death of\r\nTaicosama in the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine, [126]\r\nthe five governors kept his son carefully watched in the fortress of\r\nUsaca, with the service and pomp due his person, while they remained\r\nat Miaco at the head of the government for some time. Consequently the\r\npretensions of Faranda Quiemon to make an expedition against Manila\r\nceased altogether, and nothing more was said about the matter. Since\r\nthe affairs of Japon are never settled, but have always been in\r\na disturbed condition, they could not last many days as Taico left\r\nthem. For, with the new administration and the arrival at court, from\r\nother provinces of Japon, of tonos, lords, captains, and soldiers,\r\nwhom the combaco in his lifetime had kept busy in the wars with Coray\r\n[i.e., Corea] and the king of China, in order to divert them from\r\nthe affairs of his kingdom, the men began to become restless and\r\ncorrupt. The result was that the four governors entertained suspicions\r\nof, and quarreled with, Yeyasudono, for they feared from his manner of\r\ngoverning and procedure that he was preparing, on account of his power,\r\nto seize the empire for himself, and to exclude and take no notice\r\nof Taico's son, who had been married to his granddaughter. The flame\r\nburned still higher, for many tonos and lords of the kingdom felt the\r\nsame way about the matter; and now, either because they desired the\r\nsuccession of Taico's son, or because they liked to see matters in\r\ndisorder so that each one might act for his own interest--which was\r\nthe most likely motive, and not the affection for Taicosama, who,\r\nbeing a tyrant, had been feared rather than loved--they persuaded\r\nthe governors to oppose Yeyasudono and check his designs. Under this\r\nexcitement, the opposition became so lively, that they completely\r\ndeclared themselves, and Yeyasudono found it convenient to leave the\r\nkingdom of Miaco and go to his lands of Quanto, in order to insure his\r\nown safety and return to the capital with large forces with which to\r\ndemand obedience. The governors, understanding his intentions, were\r\nnot idle, but collected men and put two hundred thousand soldiers in\r\nthe field. They were joined by most of the tonos and lords of Japon,\r\n[127] both Christian and pagan, while the minority remained among\r\nthe partisans and followers of Yeyasudono. The latter came down as\r\nspeedily as possible from Quanto to meet the governors and their army,\r\nin order to give them battle with one hundred thousand picked men\r\nof his own land. The two armies met, and the battle was fought with\r\nall their forces. [128] In the course of the struggle, there were\r\nvarious fortunes, which rendered the result doubtful. But, finally,\r\nafter a number of men had deserted from the camp of the governors to\r\nthat of Yeyasudono, it was perceived that the latter's affairs were\r\nimproving. Victory was declared in his favor, after the death of many\r\nsoldiers and lords. Those who remained--for but few escaped--including\r\nthe four governors, surrendered to Yeyasudono. After he had beheaded\r\nthe majority of the tonos, and deprived others of their seigniories\r\nand provinces, which he granted again to men devoted to his party;\r\nand after his return to the capital, triumphant over his enemies,\r\nand master of the whole kingdom: he inflicted special punishment\r\nupon the governors, by having them crucified immediately, and their\r\nears cut off, and then carried through the streets of the principal\r\ncities of Usaca, Sacay, Fugimen, and Miaco, in carts, until they died\r\non the crosses in the midst of other tortures. Since these were the\r\nmen through whose zeal and advice Taico had, a few years before,\r\ninflicted the same punishment upon the discalced friars whom he\r\nmartyred, we may infer that God chose to punish them in this world\r\nalso with the same rigor.\r\n\r\nThus Yeyasudono remained the supreme ruler of Japon as Taico had been,\r\nbut failed to withdraw the son from the fortress of Usaca; on the\r\ncontrary he set more guards over him. Then, changing his own name,\r\nas is usual among the seigniors of Japon, he styled himself Daifusama\r\nfor the sake of greater dignity.\r\n\r\nFray Geronymo de Jesus, associate of the martyrs, who kept hidden\r\nin Japon on account of the tyrant Taicosama's persecution,\r\nlived in disguise in the interior of the country among the\r\nChristians. Consequently, although he was carefully sought, he could\r\nnot be found, until, after Taicosama's death and Daifu's seizure\r\nof the government, he came to Miaco. He found means to reveal\r\nhimself to one of Dayfu's servants, to whom he told many things\r\nabout the Filipinas, the king of España, and the latter's kingdoms\r\nand seigniories, especially those of Nueva España and Peru, of which\r\nthe Filipinas were a dependency and with whom they had communication,\r\nand the importance to Daifu of gaining the friendship and commerce of\r\nthe Spaniards. The servant found an opportunity to relate all these\r\nthings to Daifu, who for some time had desired to have the trade and\r\ncommerce which the Portuguese had established in Nangasaqui in his\r\nown kingdoms of Quanto, of which he was the natural lord, in order\r\nto give it more importance. Thinking that this could be accomplished\r\nthrough the means which Fray Geronymo had suggested, he had the latter\r\nsummoned. Having asked him his name, Fray Geronymo told the king that\r\nafter the martyrdom of his associates, he had remained in Japon,\r\nthat he was one of the religious whom the governor of Manila had\r\nsent when Taicosama was alive, to treat of peace and friendship with\r\nthe Spaniards, and who had died as was well known, after having made\r\nconverts to Christianity and established several hospitals and houses\r\nat the capital and other cities of Japon, where they healed the sick\r\nand performed other works of piety, without asking any other reward or\r\nadvantage than to serve God, to teach the souls of that kingdom the\r\nfaith and path of salvation, and to serve their neighbors. In this\r\nwork, and in works of charity, especially to the poor, as he and his\r\nfellow religious professed, they lived and maintained themselves,\r\nwithout seeking or holding any goods or property upon the earth,\r\nsolely upon the alms which were given them therefor. After this, he\r\ntold him who the king of España was, that he was a Christian, and that\r\nhe possessed great kingdoms and territories in all parts of the world;\r\nand that Nueva España, Piru, Filipinas, and India, belonged to him;\r\nand that he governed and defended them all, attending above all else\r\nto the growth and conservation of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nthe true God, and Creator of the universe. The religious explained to\r\nthe king, as well as he could, other things concerning the Christian\r\nreligion, and said that if he wished friendship with his Majesty and\r\nthe latter's subjects of Manila, as well as with his viceroys of Nueva\r\nEspaña and Piru he [i.e., Fray Geronymo] would be able to compass\r\nit, for it would be very useful and profitable to the king and to\r\nall his Japanese kingdoms and provinces. This last motive, namely,\r\nthe profit and benefit to be derived from friendship and commerce\r\nwith the Spaniards, was more to the taste of Daifusama than what he\r\nhad heard concerning their religion. Although he did not reject the\r\nlatter or say anything about it, yet at this interview and at others\r\nwith Fray Geronymo--whom Daifu had given permission to appear in\r\npublic in his religious habit, and to whom he furnished the necessary\r\nsupport--he treated only of friendship with the governor of Manila,\r\nof the Spaniards' coming yearly with ships from Manila to trade at\r\nQuanto, where the Japanese had a port, and an established commerce\r\nwith the Spaniards. Also his Japanese were to sail thence to Nueva\r\nEspaña, where they were to enjoy the same amity and trade. As he\r\nunderstood the voyage to be long and Spanish ships necessary for\r\nit, Daifu proposed that the governor of Manila send him masters and\r\nworkmen to build them. He also proposed that in the said kingdom and\r\nprincipal port of Quanto, which, as above-said, lies in the north\r\nof Japon, and is a mountainous country, abounding in silver mines,\r\nwhich were not worked because no one knew how, Fray Geronymo and\r\nwhatever associates he might choose from among the Spaniards who\r\ncame there, should establish their house and dwelling, just as the\r\nreligious of the Society of Jesus had theirs with the Portuguese\r\nin Nangasaqui. Fray Geronymo, who desired by any means to restore\r\nthe cause of his religious, and of the conversion of Japon through\r\ntheir labor, as they had begun to do when the martyrs were alive--for\r\nthis aim alone moved him--did not doubt that he could once and many\r\ntimes facilitate Daifusama's desires, and even assured him that they\r\nwould certainly be realized through his help, and that there would\r\nbe no difficulty whatever to prevent this. Thereupon Daifu appeared\r\nfavorable and more inclined to the affairs of Manila than Taico,\r\nhis predecessor, had been. He assured the religious that he would\r\ngive the Spaniards a good reception in Japon, and that the ships,\r\nwhich should happen to put in there in distress or in any other way,\r\nwould be equipped and despatched with all necessities; and that he\r\nwould not allow any Japanese to go to plunder or commit any injury\r\non the coasts of the Filipinas. In fact, because he learned that\r\nsix ships of Japanese corsairs had sailed that year from the island\r\nof Zazuma [Satsuma] and other ports of the lower kingdoms, and had\r\nseized and plundered two Chinese merchantmen on the way to Manila, and\r\nhad done other mischief on its coast, he immediately had them sought\r\nout in his kingdom. Having imprisoned more than four hundred men,\r\nhe had them all crucified. Likewise he ordered that, in the future,\r\nthe annual ships from Nangasaqui to Manila laden with flour and other\r\ngoods should not be so numerous, but only enough to supply Manila,\r\nand that they should have the permission and sanction of its governor,\r\nso that they might not be the cause of loss or injury to that place.\r\n\r\nSince Daifu pressed Fray Geronymo more and more every day for the\r\nfulfilment of what he had taken upon himself, the latter told him\r\nthat he had already written and would write again about those matters\r\nto the governor and royal Audiencia of Manila. He requested Daifu to\r\nsend a servant of his household with these letters and the message,\r\nin order that they might have more credit and authority. Daifu\r\napproved of this and despatched them through Captain Chiquiro, a\r\npagan Japanese and a servant of his, who took a present of various\r\nweapons to the governor and the letters of Fray Geronymo. There\r\nwas no special letter from Daifu, except that Fray Geronymo said\r\nthat he wrote and petitioned in the name of Daifu. He explained the\r\nbetter condition of peace and friendship now existing between the\r\nFilipinas and Japon, and what Daifu promised and assured. He wrote\r\nthat, in order to facilitate the above, Daifu had promised him that\r\nthe Spaniards could go with their ships to trade at Quanto, and that\r\nthe governor should send him masters and workmen to build ships for\r\nthe voyage from Japon to Nueva España. There was also to be commerce\r\nand friendship with the viceroy of that country. He said that Daifu\r\nhad already given leave for religious to go to Japon, to christianize\r\nand to found churches and monasteries, and had given him a good site\r\nfor a monastery in Miaco, where he was, and that the same would be\r\ndone in other parts and regions of Japon in which they might wish to\r\nsettle. Fray Geronymo insidiously and cunningly added this last to\r\nDaifu's promise in order that he might incite the religious of the\r\nFilipinas to push the matter more earnestly before the governor and\r\nAudiencia, that they might agree to this more easily, in order not\r\nto lose the great results that Fray Geronymo said were set afoot.\r\n\r\nDuring the same administration of Don Francisco Tello, in the year\r\none thousand six hundred, toward the end of the month of October,\r\na ship came from the province of Camarines with news that two ships,\r\na flagship and its almiranta, well armed and with foreign crews,\r\nhad entered and anchored in one of its northern bays, twenty leguas\r\nfrom the channel and cape of Espiritu Sancto. Under pretense of\r\nbeing friends of the Spaniards they asked, and bartered with, the\r\nnatives for rice and other provisions that they needed. Then they\r\nweighed anchor and went away, making for the channel through which\r\nthey entered, after having left certain feigned letters for Governor\r\nDon Francisco Tello, in which they declared themselves friends,\r\nand that they were coming to Manila to trade by permission of his\r\nMajesty. From this, and from a negro who escaped from these ships\r\nby swimming to the island of Capul, and also through an Englishman,\r\n[129] seized by the natives while on shore, we learned that these\r\nships were from Holanda, whence they had sailed in a convoy of three\r\nother armed vessels, with patents and documents from Count Mauricio de\r\nNasao who called himself Prince of Orange, in order to make prizes in\r\nthe Indias. [130] Having entered the South Sea through the strait of\r\nMagallanes, three of the five ships had been lost, and these two, the\r\nflagship and the almiranta coasted along Chile, where they captured\r\ntwo vessels. Then, having turned away from the coast of Lima, they\r\nput out to sea and pursued their voyage, without stopping anywhere,\r\nin the direction of the Filipinas, among which they entered with the\r\nintention of plundering whatever might come their way. Having learned\r\nthat a galleon, named \"Santo Tomas\" was expected from Nueva España with\r\nthe money derived from the merchandise of two years' cargoes which had\r\nbeen sent there from Manila; that in a few days merchant ships would\r\nbegin to arrive from China, by which they could fill their hands;\r\nand that there were no galleys or armed ships at that season which\r\ncould do them any harm: they determined to go as far as the mouth of\r\nManila Bay, and stay there, supplying themselves with the provisions\r\nand refreshments which might enter the city; and accordingly, they\r\ncarried out this resolution. The flagship named \"Mauricio,\" with one\r\nhundred men and twenty-four pieces of bronze artillery with ladles\r\n[131] was under the command of Oliber de Nort [i.e., Oliver van\r\nNoordt] of Amstradam. This ship was one of those which the count of\r\nLeste had several years before at the taking of the city of Cadiz.\r\n[132] The almiranta named \"Concordia,\" with forty men and ten pieces\r\nof artillery, was under command of Captain Lamberto Viesman of\r\nRoterdam. When these ships were seen on the coast of Chile, Viceroy\r\nDon Luis de Velasco, who was governor in Piru, despatched a fleet\r\nof vessels well equipped with artillery and brave soldiers to follow\r\nand pursue them along the coast of Piru and Nueva España, as far as\r\nCalifornia. The fleet left Callao de Lima, under command of Don Joan de\r\nVelasco, but was unable to find the enemy, as they had left the coast,\r\nput out to sea, and steered for the Filipinas. Moreover the Piru fleet,\r\nhaving been overtaken by a storm on its way back from California,\r\nlost its flagship with all hands aboard and was never seen again.\r\n\r\nGovernor Don Francisco Tello, seeing that this corsair was making\r\nincursions among the islands, according to the information given\r\nhim by certain captains and soldiers whom he had sent by land along\r\nthe coasts of the island of Luzon, in order to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom landing men and from injuring the settlements, and from the\r\ninformation given by certain small single boats which had kept in\r\nsight of the enemy, discussed plans for meeting this necessity. This\r\nit appeared very difficult to do on that occasion, not only because\r\nthe governor found himself without any kind of rowing vessels or ships\r\nwith high freeboard, with which to put to sea, but also because he had\r\nfew soldiers in the camp, for the majority of them were with Captain\r\nand Sargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato in the Pintados provinces,\r\ntogether with galleys, galliots, and other craft, for the purpose of\r\ndefending the natives against the ships of the Mindanaos and Joloans,\r\nwho were continually making plundering expeditions against them, and\r\nof preparing for the expedition which it was thought would be made from\r\nJolo at the first monsoon, and which could no longer be deferred. When\r\nthe governor saw himself hard pressed by this difficulty, and that the\r\nDutch enemy could cause so much harm, take so many prizes, and then\r\ndepart with them, leaving the country ruined, he summoned the Audiencia\r\nand communicated the state of affairs to them, requesting the auditors\r\nto assist him in person in any advisable course. They discussed what\r\nshould be done, namely, to put the port of Cabit, which is inside\r\nthe bay, into a state of defense, in order to prevent the enemy from\r\nseizing it, together with the magazines, artillery, and shipyard; then\r\nto endeavor to equip several ships with which to put to sea and offer\r\nsome resistance to the enemy--even if no more could be done--so that\r\nhe might not firmly establish himself in the land, and that he might\r\nbe induced to leave the islands. For, if the enemy found everything\r\nso defenseless and if no resistance were offered him, he would remain\r\nthere until he attained his designs. The execution of these measures\r\nwas entrusted to Doctor Antonio de Morga. Licentiate Telles de Almaçan\r\nwas ordered to remain in the city with the governor and president for\r\nits defense, and to supply thence the port of Cabit and Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga with what was necessary for the latter's commission. On the\r\nsame day, the last of October of the year six hundred, Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga left Manila with some soldiers and ammunition and went to the\r\nport of Cabit, which he put in a state of defense with one hundred and\r\nfifty men, both arquebusiers and musketeers, who kept continual watch\r\nday and night over the port, by means of sentinels and outposts at\r\nthe necessary points. He collected at the settlement all the vessels\r\nin port, and stationed them as near as possible to the shipyards,\r\nwhere a galizabra was being built, and where lay a ship of Sebu with\r\na small Portuguese patache, the latter of which had come from Malaca\r\nladen with merchandise. For the defense of these he placed and planted\r\non shore twelve pieces of moderate-sized bronze cannon with ladles,\r\nbesides two of greater range, which were placed on a point at the\r\nentrance of the port. These altogether commanded the port and the\r\nvessels in it. Farther on along the beach, a rampart was made with\r\nstakes and planks, filled in with earth, behind which, in case the\r\nenemy should enter, the soldiery could cover and defend themselves\r\nwith their artillery. After the auditor had thus put the said port\r\nin a state of defense, he planned to complete the galizabra, although\r\nmuch work was still needed, to launch it, and fit it with sails, and\r\nat the same time to refit the Sebu ship. He attended to these works\r\nwith so great haste that within thirty days he hoisted the yards on\r\nthe galizabra and on the Sebu ship, and furnished each of the two with\r\neleven pieces of artillery, both of large and moderate size, which\r\nhad been sent from Manila, in addition to the artillery in the port.\r\n\r\nThe corsair reached the mouth of the bay, eight leguas from the\r\nport of Cabit, but did not dare to make a dash into the port, as he\r\nhad planned, for he learned from some Sangleys who were going out\r\nto sea with their champans, that it was already defended. However,\r\nhe was not informed that the Spaniards were arming to attack him,\r\nor that there was any preparation or forces at that season for\r\nthat purpose. Accordingly he contented himself with remaining at\r\nthe mouth of the bay, moving about with both ships and their boats,\r\nand going from one side to another on various days, in order to seize\r\nthe vessels coming to the city with provisions, and not allowing one\r\nto escape him. At night he anchored under shelter of the land. All\r\nthis took place four leguas from the mouth of the bay, and he went\r\nno farther from it, in order to be ready for any occasion that might\r\npresent itself.\r\n\r\nDoctor Antonio de Morga kept several very small and swift vessels\r\nwithin sight of the enemy, under shelter of the land, which informed\r\nhim daily of the enemy's position and doings. They reported that\r\nhe had quietly stationed himself, and that every evening he placed\r\nhis guard on deck with drums and flags, and firing of musketry. The\r\ncorsair's forces could be estimated from that and it could be seen\r\nthat the larger and better contingent was aboard the flagship, which\r\nwas a good and swift ship. The auditor also took the precaution\r\nnot to let any champan or ship leave the bay, in order not to give\r\nthe corsair an opportunity to learn what was going on. When affairs\r\nreached this point, he informed the governor of what had been done,\r\nand suggested that, if the latter thought it advisable, the Portuguese\r\nvessel might also be equipped, in order to sally out with the two\r\nships--the galizabra and the \"Sant Antonio\" of Sebu--for he had laid\r\nan embargo on it, and had fitted it for that purpose. Ammunition\r\nand some provisions of rice and fish were providedfor the two ships,\r\nand it remained only to man them with sailors and soldiers who were\r\nto go out in them. Of such there was little supply; the sailors were\r\nhiding and feigning sickness, and one and all showed little desire\r\nto undertake an affair of more risk and peril than of personal\r\nprofit. The captains and private soldiers of the city, who were\r\nreceiving neither pay nor rations from the king, but who could go\r\non the expedition, did not offer their services to the governor;\r\nand if anyone were ready to do so, he dissembled until knowing who\r\nwas to be commander of the fleet. For, although some land captains\r\nmight fill the place, the governor was not inclined to appoint any\r\nof them, nor were the others willing to go under their command. Each\r\none claimed and boasted himself capable of being the leader, and\r\nnone other of his neighbors was to have command. The governor was\r\nprevented from going out in person, and learned that all the people\r\nof the city were willing to go with Doctor Antonio de Morga if he\r\nhad command of the fleet, and would not mind any dangers that might\r\npresent themselves. When the governor learned the desire of those who\r\nwere able to embark, and understood that there was no other means\r\nby which to realize the aim in view, and that each day's delay was\r\nof very great detriment, he summoned the auditor to the city and set\r\nthe matter before him. In order that the latter might not refuse, the\r\ngovernor issued an act and had the auditor immediately notified by the\r\nsecretary of the government and ordered, on behalf of his Majesty,\r\nto embark as general and commander of the fleet and to follow and\r\npursue the corsair, because, as matters stood, the suitable result\r\ncould not be attained otherwise. The auditor, thinking that, if he\r\nfailed to take up the matter, he would receive the blame of losing so\r\npressing an occasion for the service of God and his Majesty, and for\r\nthe welfare of the whole country; and, since war affairs both of sea\r\nand of land had been under his charge and management, that it might\r\nbe reckoned ill against him if he turned his back at this juncture,\r\nwhen he had been sought for it and served especially with papers from\r\nthe governor, appointing him to the charge: obeyed for the discharge\r\nof his conscience the orders set forth in the governor's act, which\r\ntogether with his answer reads word for word as follows.\r\n\r\nEdict of Governor Don Francisco Tello, and reply of Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga\r\n\r\nIn the city of Manila, on the first of December, one thousand six\r\nhundred, Don Francisco Tello, knight of the Order of Santiago, governor\r\nand captain-general of these Filipinas Islands, and president of the\r\nroyal Audiencia resident therein, declared: That, whereas, because\r\nof the coming to these islands of two hostile English [sic] ships,\r\nthe preparation of a fleet to attack them was immediately discussed\r\nwith the resolution and advice of the royal Audiencia, and for this\r\neffect it was resolved that Antonio de Morga should go to the port of\r\nCabit to attend to the fitting and despatch of the said war-vessels\r\nand the defense of that port, as appears, by the act and resolution\r\nmade thereon, in the book of the government matters pertaining to\r\nthis said Audiencia, on the last day of the month of October, of this\r\npresent year, and to which we refer; and whereas, in execution of the\r\nsaid resolution, he has attended until now, to the defense of the said\r\nport, and the fitting and equipping of the said fleet, consisting of\r\nthe vessel \"San Diego,\" [133] of Sebu, the galleon \"San Bartolome,\"\r\nwhich he caused to be finished in the shipyard and launched, an English\r\n[134] patache from the city of Malaca, a galliot which was fitted up,\r\nand other smaller craft; and whereas, the said fleet, because of his\r\ndiligence and care, is in so good condition that it can shortly sail,\r\nand the said enemy is still near this city, on the coast of the island\r\nof Miraveles [i.e., Corregidor]; and whereas, many captains, knights,\r\nand chief men of this community have heard that the said auditor was\r\nto make the said expedition, they have offered to go with him to serve\r\nthe king, our sovereign, in it at their own expense; and whereas,\r\na great preparation of men and provisions has been made with this\r\nintent, which would fail and be of no effect did the said auditor not\r\nsail with the said fleet in pursuit of the said enemy, and would not\r\nhave the result aimed at--a matter so greatly to the service of God\r\nour Lord, and the welfare of this country--and whereas, moreover, the\r\nsaid auditor is (as is a fact) experienced in matters of war, and has\r\nbeen general of his Majesty's fleets by the latter's own appointment\r\nat other times, and lieutenant of the captain-general in this kingdom\r\nfor several years, in which he has fulfilled his duties well; and\r\nwhereas he is highly esteemed and liked by the soldiers; and whereas\r\nhe is the most suitable man, according to the condition of affairs;\r\nand for other just considerations that move the governor thereto,\r\nso that the said expedition may be effected and not fall through,\r\nor at least, so that it may not be delayed with loss and trouble:\r\ntherefore he ordered--and he did so order--the said auditor, since\r\nhe has fostered this affair, and has personally put it in its present\r\ngood shape, and since all the men--and they are many--who receive no\r\npay, have prepared in consideration of him, to prepare himself to go\r\nas general and commander of the said fleet in pursuit of the enemy,\r\nwith all possible haste. For this the governor said that he would\r\ngive him the necessary messages and instructions, for thus is it\r\nadvantageous to the service of the king our sovereign. In the name of\r\nthe latter, the governor orders him to do and accomplish the above. He\r\n[i.e., the governor] as president of the said royal Audiencia,\r\ngrants him leave and absence for the above during the time that he\r\nshall occupy himself therein, from attendance on his duties in the\r\nsaid royal Audiencia. He gave him the commission in due legal form,\r\nand authority for the said absence. Thus he provided and ordered,\r\nand affixed his signature thereto.\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO TELLO\r\n\r\nBefore me:\r\n\r\nGASPAR DE AZEBO\r\n\r\nIn the city of Manila, on the first of December, of the year one\r\nthousand six hundred, I, the government notary, served the above act\r\nupon Doctor Antonio de Morga, auditor of the royal Audiencia. He\r\ndeclared that, from the first day of the month of November just\r\nexpired, by commission of the royal Audiencia of these islands, he\r\nhas busied himself in everything mentioned in the said act, and has\r\ndone his utmost toward its execution; that the expedition is on the\r\ngood footing and in the condition that is known; that if, for its good\r\nresult and for what is expected from it, his person and property are\r\nsuitable and fitting for the service of the king our sovereign, he\r\nis ready to employ everything in it and to do what has been ordered\r\nand commanded him by the said president; and that consequently he\r\nhas no other wish or desire than for what might be to the service of\r\nGod and of his Majesty. Thereupon may your Lordship order and provide\r\nwhat may be found most expedient, and as such he will fulfil it. He\r\naffixed his signature to this writ.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR ANTONIO DE MORGA\r\n\r\nGASPAR DE AZEBO\r\n\r\nDoctor Antonio de Morga provided himself with all that was requisite\r\nfor the expedition without asking or taking anything from the\r\nking's exchequer. He aided several needy soldiers who came to offer\r\ntheir services, and many other persons of importance who had done\r\nthe same, so that, within one week, there were already enough men\r\nfor the expedition, and an abundance of provisions, ship's stores,\r\nand arms; whereupon all embarked. With the volunteers and regulars\r\nwhom the governor had in camp under Captain Augustin de Urdiales, and\r\nwhom he gave to the auditor, there were men enough to man both ships\r\neach with about one hundred soldiers in addition to gunners, sailors,\r\nand common seamen, of the last mentioned of whom there was a smaller\r\nsupply than was needed. As admiral of this fleet the governor appointed\r\nCaptain Joan de Alcega, an old soldier, and one well acquainted with\r\nthe islands; as captain of the paid soldiers who were to sail in the\r\nalmiranta, Joan Tello y Aguirre; as sargento-mayor of the fleet, Don\r\nPedro Tello, his kinsman; the necessary other offices and positions;\r\nand the nomination and title of general of the fleet to Doctor Antonio\r\nde Morga. He gave the latter closed and sealed instructions concerning\r\nwhat he was to do in the course of the voyage and expedition, with\r\norders not to open them until he had put to sea, outside of the bay\r\nof Manila. The instructions read as follows.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nInstructions given by the governor to Doctor Antonio de Morga\r\n\r\nWhat Doctor Antonio de Morga, auditor of the royal Audiencia of these\r\nFilipinas Islands, and captain-general of the fleet which is about\r\nto pursue the English [sic] enemy, has to do, is as follows.\r\n\r\nFirst, inasmuch as we have been informed that the English [sic] enemy,\r\nagainst whom this fleet has been prepared, lies in the bay of Maryuma,\r\n[135] it is ordered that, lest perchance the enemy hearing of our\r\nfleet should try to escape without receiving any injury, the fleet\r\nsail as quickly as possible in his pursuit, in order to engage and\r\nfight him until, through the grace of our Lord, he be taken or sunk.\r\n\r\nItem: If, in fighting the said enemy both with artillery and in\r\ngrappling--and this shall be attempted with all the diligence and\r\ncare possible--whichever the weather may better and more conveniently\r\npermit, the latter should take to flight at sight of the fleet,\r\nhe shall be pursued until the desired result is attained.\r\n\r\nItem: If, at the time that the fleet sails to attack the said enemy he\r\nshall have left this coast and news is received that he has coasted\r\nto any other of these islands, the fleet shall follow and pursue\r\nhim until he is taken or sunk. If the enemy has left these islands,\r\nthe fleet shall pursue him as far as possible; but this is left to\r\nyour own discretion so long as the object be attained.\r\n\r\nItem: Inasmuch as the opinion was expressed in a council of war held\r\non the second day of the present month and year, by the master-of-camp\r\nand the captains who were present, that, if there were no certain\r\ninformation of the course and direction taken by the enemy, the said\r\nfleet should follow the coast of Ilocos, and make for the strait\r\nof Sincapura, through which it is presumed that the enemy will pass\r\nin order to pursue his voyage: notwithstanding the said council of\r\nwar, if the said general should not receive any information as to\r\nthe course taken by the enemy, then he shall do what he thinks most\r\nexpedient, as the one in charge of the affair, and as the enemy and\r\nthe occasion allow, endeavoring to obtain the desired object, namely,\r\nthe overtaking and destruction of the enemy.\r\n\r\nItem: If the fleet should encounter any other hostile pirates or any\r\nothers going about these islands or who shall have left them after\r\ndoing them injury, whether they be English, Japanese, Terrenatans,\r\nMindanaos, or others, it shall endeavor to chastise and injure them, so\r\nthat should this occur a good result might also be obtained therefrom.\r\n\r\nItem: If the enemy be captured, as is hoped through the grace of God\r\nour Lord, the survivors and ships shall be brought in by the fleet.\r\n\r\nItem: Any spoil found in the said ships shall be divided as is\r\ncustomary, among the victors.\r\n\r\nItem: Great care shall be exercised to keep the men of the fleet\r\npeaceable and well disciplined; concerning this, the course taken on\r\nsimilar occasions shall be followed.\r\n\r\nItem: A good system in regard to the provisions and ammunition carried\r\nshall be observed, and the use of them all well moderated, especially\r\nshould the fleet leave sight of these islands.\r\n\r\nItem: If perchance, after having engaged the said enemy or pursued\r\nhim, he should leave these islands, then, the object having been\r\naccomplished, you shall endeavor to return as speedily as possible\r\nto the islands. If the weather do not permit a return until the\r\nmonsoon sets in, you shall endeavor to keep the fleet together and\r\nto supply and provide it with everything necessary, at the expense\r\nof his Majesty, so that you may pursue your voyage with the greatest\r\nspeed and safety possible. Given in the city of Manila, the tenth of\r\nDecember of the year one thousand six hundred.\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO TELLO\r\n\r\nBy order of the governor and captain-general:\r\n\r\nGASPAR DE AZEBO\r\n\r\nThe auditor went to the port with all his men and put them aboard\r\nthe two ships. As flagship he took the \"Sant Antonio\" of Sebu, on\r\naccount of its having more room to accommodate the assistants [gente\r\nde cumplimiento] who embarked with him. He left the Portuguese patache\r\nbecause the governor had taken off the embargo, in order to allow the\r\nPortuguese to return with it to Malaca without loss of time. Then he\r\nequipped two caracoas for the service of the fleet with Indian crews\r\nand two Spaniards to direct them. After they had confessed and taken\r\ncommunion, they left the port of Cabit and set sail on the twelfth day\r\nof the month of December of the year one thousand six hundred, with\r\nAlonzo Gomez as chief pilot. They also took Father Diego de Santiago\r\nand a lay brother of the Society of Jesus, and Fray Francisco de Valdes\r\nof the Order of Augustine, aboard the flagship; and Fray Joan Gutierrez\r\n[136] and another associate of the same order aboard the almiranta,\r\nso that they might attend to whatever required their ministry.\r\n\r\nAt night of the same day both ships of this fleet anchored near the\r\nsettlement and anchorage of the island of Miraveles at the mouth of\r\nthe bay. Immediately at daybreak a barangai approached the ships from\r\nshore with the sentinels whom the auditor had hastily sent the day\r\nbefore to obtain some reliable news of the corsair's position. They\r\ntold him that, as soon as the fleet sailed from the port of Cabit, the\r\nenemy, who lay in the direction of the port Del Fraile [of the Friar],\r\n[137] had also weighed anchor, and having stowed their small boats,\r\nboth ships had crossed to the other and sea side, and that they had\r\nseen him anchor after nightfall opposite the point of Valeitegui,\r\n[138] where he still was. Upon hearing this, the auditor thought that\r\nperhaps the corsair had been informed of the preparation of the fleet\r\nand of its departure, and had consequently weighed anchor from his\r\nposition; and that, since he had stowed his small boats aboard the\r\nships, he was about to put to sea to avoid the fleet. He immediately\r\nsent the same news to the admiral, and opened the instructions given\r\nhim by the governor. Seeing that he was ordered thereby to seek the\r\nenemy with all diligence, pursue him, and endeavor to fight him, he\r\nthought best to shorten the work before him, and to lose no time and\r\nnot allow the enemy to get farther away. With this object in view,\r\nthe fleet spent the thirteenth of December, St. Lucy's day, in making\r\nwaist-cloths, arranging the artillery, getting ready the weapons,\r\nalloting men to their posts, and preparing themselves to fight on\r\nthe next day, on which it was thought that they would fall in with\r\nthe corsair. The auditor sent special instructions in writing to the\r\nadmiral concerning what he was to do and observe on his part. These\r\ninstructions specified chiefly that upon engaging with the enemy,\r\nboth ships were to grapple and fight the corsair's flagship--in which\r\nwere carried all the forces--and other things which will be understood\r\nfrom the instructions given to the admiral. These were as follows.\r\n\r\n[These instructions are given in VOL. XI of this series, pp. 145-148.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the auditor notified the admiral that the fleet\r\nwould weigh anchor from its anchorage shortly after midnight, and\r\nwould go out of the bay to sea, crowding all sail possible, so that\r\nat dawn it might be off the point of Baleitigui to windward of the\r\npoint where the enemy had anchored on Tuesday night, according to\r\nthe sentinels' report.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour both vessels--the flagship and the\r\nalmiranta--weighed anchor from Miraveles, and, favored by a light\r\nwind, sailed the rest of the night toward Baleitigui. The two\r\ncaracoas used as tenders could not follow because of a choppy sea,\r\nand a fresh northwester; they crossed within the bay, and under\r\nshelter of the land to the other side. At the first streak of light\r\nboth vessels of the fleet found themselves off the point; and one\r\nlegua to leeward, and seaward, they sighted the corsair's two vessels\r\nriding at anchor. As soon as the latter recognized our ships and saw\r\nthat they flung captain's and admiral's colors at the masthead, they\r\nweighed anchor and set sail from their anchorage, after having first\r\nreënforced the flagship with a boatload of men from their almiranta,\r\nwhich stood to sea, while the flagship hove to, and awaited our fleet,\r\nfiring several pieces at long range. The flagship of our fleet being\r\nunable to answer the enemy with its artillery because the gun-ports\r\nwere shut, and the vessel was tacking to starboard, determined to\r\nclose with him. It grappled his flagship on the port side, sweeping\r\nand clearing the decks of the men on them. Then the colors with thirty\r\nsoldiers and a few sailors were thrown aboard. They took possession of\r\nthe forecastle and after-cabin and captured their colors at masthead\r\nand quarter, and the white, blue, and orange standard with the arms\r\nof Count Mauricio flung at the stern. The main- and mizzen-mast were\r\nstripped of all the rigging and sails, and a large boat which the\r\nenemy carried on the poop was captured. The enemy, who had retreated\r\nto the bows below the harpings, upon seeing two ships attacking\r\nhim with so great resolution, sent to ask the auditor for terms\r\nof surrender. While an answer was being given him, Admiral Joan de\r\nAlcega, who, in accordance with the instructions given him the day\r\nprevious by the auditor, ought to have grappled at the same time as\r\nthe flagship, and lashed his vessel to the enemy, thinking that the\r\nvictory was won, that the corsair's almiranta was escaping, and that it\r\nwould be well to capture it, left the flagship and followed astern of\r\nLamberto Viezman, crowding all sail and chasing him until he overtook\r\nhim. Oliber de Nort, seeing himself alone and with a better ship and\r\nartillery than the auditor's, waited no longer for the answer to the\r\nterms for which he had asked at first, and renewed the fight with\r\nmusketry and artillery. The combat between the two flagships was so\r\nobstinate and bitter on both sides that it lasted more than six hours,\r\nand many were killed on both sides. But the corsair had the worst of\r\nit all the time, for not more than fifteen of his men were left alive,\r\nand those badly maimed and wounded. [139] Finally the corsair's ship\r\ncaught fire, and the flames rose high by the mizzen-mast and in the\r\nstern. The auditor, in order not to endanger his own ship, found it\r\nnecessary to recall his colors and men from the enemy's ship, and\r\nto cast loose and separate from it. This he did, only to discover\r\nthat his ship, from the pounding of the artillery during so long a\r\ncombat, as it was but slightly strengthened, had an opening in the\r\nbows and was filling so rapidly that being unable to overcome the\r\nleak, it was foundering. The corsair seeing his opponent's trouble\r\nand his inability to follow him, made haste with his few remaining\r\nmen to extinguish the fire on board his ship. Having quenched it,\r\nhe set his foresail, which was still left. Shattered in all parts,\r\nstripped of rigging, and without men he reached Borneo and Sunda,\r\nwhere he was seen so enfeebled and distressed that it seemed impossible\r\nfor him to navigate, or to go farther without shipwreck. The Spanish\r\nflagship, which was fully occupied in trying to remedy the extremity\r\nto which it was reduced, could not be assisted, because it was alone\r\nand far from land, and consequently sank so rapidly that the men\r\ncould neither disarm themselves, nor get hold of anything which\r\nmight be of help to them. The auditor did not abandon the ship,\r\nalthough some soldiers, in order to escape therein, seized the boat\r\nat the stern, and asked him also to get into it. Thereupon they made\r\noff and went away, in order to prevent others from taking it away\r\nfrom them. When the ship sunk, the auditor swam constantly for four\r\nhours, with the quarter colors and the enemy's standard which he took\r\nwith him. He reached a very small desert island, two leguas away,\r\ncalled Fortuna, where a few of the ship's men who had more endurance\r\nin the sea, also arrived in safety. Some perished and were drowned,\r\nfor they had not even disarmed themselves, and whom this predicament\r\nhad overtaken when exhausted by the long fight with the enemy. Those\r\nwho met death on this occasion were fifty in all. The most important\r\namong them were Captains Don Francisco de Mendoça, Gregorio de Vargas,\r\nFrancisco Rodriguez, and Gaspar de los Rios, [140] all of whom died\r\nfighting with the enemy. Among those drowned at sea were Captains Don\r\nJoan de Camudio, Augustin de Urdiales, Don Pedro Tello, Don Gabriel\r\nMaldonado, Don Cristoval de Heredia, Don Luis de Belver, Don Alonso\r\nLoçano, Domingo de Arrieta, Melchior de Figueroa, Chief-pilot Alonso\r\nGomez, father Fray Diego de Santiago, and the brother who went with\r\nhim. Admiral Joan de Alcega, having overtaken Lamberto Viezman slightly\r\nafter midday, captured him with little resistance; and although he\r\nafterward saw the so battered ship of Oliber del Nort pass by and\r\nescaping at a short distance, he did not pursue him. On the contrary,\r\nwithout stopping longer, he returned with his almiranta to Miraveles,\r\nleaving the prize with some of his own men, whom he had put aboard\r\nit, to follow him. He neither looked for his flagship nor took any\r\nother step, imagining that if any mishap had occurred, he might be\r\nblamed for leaving the flagship alone with the corsair and pursuing\r\nLambert Biezman without orders from the auditor, and contrary to\r\nthe instructions given him in writing; and fearing lest if he were to\r\nrejoin the auditor after having left him, ill would befall himself. The\r\nauditor took the wounded and the men who had escaped from the islet of\r\nFortun, at nightfall, in his ship's boat which he found at that port,\r\nas well as the corsair's boat and a caracoa which arrived there. And\r\non the following day, he landed them in Luzon, at the bar of Anazibu,\r\nin the province of Balayan, [141] thirty leguas from Manila, where\r\nhe supplied them with provisions as quickly as possible. Moreover he\r\nexplored the coast and neighboring islands with swift boats, in search\r\nof his almiranta and the captured corsair. This prize was taken to\r\nManila, with twenty-five men alive and the admiral, ten pieces of\r\nartillery, and a quantity of wine, oil, cloth, linen, weapons, and\r\nother goods which it carried. The admiral and the Dutchmen of his\r\ncompany were garroted by orders of the governor. [142] Thus ended\r\nthe expedition. Thereby was averted the injury which it was thought\r\nthat the corsair would inflict in these seas, had he been allowed\r\nto remain there with the aim that he cherished, although so much\r\nto the detriment of the Spaniards by the loss of their flagship,\r\nwhich would not have happened had the orders of the auditor been\r\nobserved. Governor Don Francisco Tello presented an attestation of\r\nthis event to the auditor, which is as follows.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nAttestation of Governor Don Francisco Tello of events in the expedition\r\nagainst the Dutch corsair\r\n\r\nDon Francisco Tello, knight of the Order of Santiago, governor and\r\ncaptain-general in these Filipinas Islands, and president of the\r\nAudiencia and royal Chancillería resident therein, etc.: I certify\r\nto whomever may see this present, that last year, one thousand six\r\nhundred, a squadron of Dutch war-vessels under command of Oliber\r\ndel Nort, after passing through the strait of Magallanes to the\r\nSouth Sea, reached these islands, in the month of October of the\r\nsaid year, with two armed ships. They entered among these islands,\r\nmaking prizes and committing depredations, and at length stationed\r\nthemselves off the entrance of the bay of the city of Manila, with\r\nthe design of lying in wait for the merchant ships from China, and\r\nfor the galleon \"Santo Tomas,\" expected from Nueva España with the\r\nsilver of two years belonging to the merchants of this kingdom. By a\r\ndecision of the said royal Audiencia, on the thirty-first of October\r\nof the said year, Doctor Antonio de Morga, senior auditor of the said\r\nAudiencia, was commissioned and charged to go immediately to the\r\nport of Cabit, and place and hold it in a state of defense, and to\r\nprepare and equip a fleet to attack the corsair. In this matter the\r\nsaid auditor busied himself in person. Having, with great assiduity\r\nand industry, fortified and put the said port in a state of defense,\r\nhe completed in the shipyard and then launched, a moderate-sized ship,\r\narmed and equipped another belonging to private persons then in the\r\nport, both of which he equipped with yards and rigging--all inside of\r\nforty days. In order that the expedition might be made more quickly,\r\nand with a supply of soldiers and the most necessary equipment,\r\ninasmuch as affairs were such that it could be done by no one else,\r\non the first of December of the same year, I nominated and appointed\r\nthe said auditor to sail as general of the fleet in pursuit of the\r\nenemy, and to fight him until destroying and driving him from these\r\nislands. The said auditor performed and accomplished this in the\r\nfollowing manner. On the twelfth of the said month of December,\r\nhe sailed with the two ships of his fleet from the port of Cabit;\r\non the fourteenth of the same month, at dawn, he sighted the corsair\r\noutside of the bay of this city, off the promontory of Baleitigui,\r\nwith his two ships--flagship and almiranta. He pursued the enemy until\r\nhe came close to him; and both fleets having prepared for action,\r\nengaged one another. The said auditor in his flagship attacked the\r\ncorsair's flagship with great gallantry and resolution, and grappled\r\nit. The latter was a large and strong ship, carrying a quantity of\r\nartillery and many fighting men. The auditor immediately threw on\r\nboard the enemy the infantry colors with thirty arquebusiers and a\r\nfew volunteers and sailors, who captured the forecastle, after-cabin,\r\nand the colors of the vessel. At the end of the action, these men\r\nretreated to our ship on account of the violent fire which at the\r\nlast began to rage aboard the enemy's ship. Thereupon the action\r\nand fight continued on both sides, and lasted more than six hours,\r\nduring which the artillery, musketry, and arquebuses were repeatedly\r\ndischarged in all quarters. In another direction the enemy's almiranta,\r\ncommanded by Lamberto Viezman, was defeated and captured, with the\r\ncrew, artillery and other things aboard it. The two flagships having\r\ncast loose and separated on account of the fire which had broken out,\r\nand the quantity of water that poured in our bows, the enemy took\r\nto flight with only the foremast standing, with nearly all his men\r\nkilled, and having lost his boat, the standard and the colors at his\r\nmasthead and quarter. Stripped of his yards, sails, and rigging, and\r\nthe ship leaking in many places, the enemy ran before the wind. It\r\nhas been heard from various sources that he passed Borneo with only\r\nfifteen or sixteen men alive, and most of them maimed and wounded,\r\nand that a few days later, he was entirely wrecked not far from\r\nthe Sunda. [143] The said auditor and his companions suffered great\r\nhardship and danger; for besides several men of note who died fighting,\r\nthe ship which was leaking at the bows as abovesaid, because of being\r\nweak and not built for a war vessel, and as they were unable to stop\r\nor overcome the leak, foundered that same day, and part of the men\r\non board were drowned on account of being wearied with fighting and\r\nnot even yet having disarmed. When the ship sunk, the said auditor,\r\nwho would never leave or abandon it, took to the water with the rest\r\nof the men, and escaped by swimming, with some of the enemy's colors\r\nabout him, to an uninhabited islet, called Fortun, two leguas from\r\nthe place where the fight had taken place. The next day he took away\r\nthe people from that place in several small boats which he found,\r\nand landed them in safety on this island. In all the above, the said\r\nauditor acted with great diligence and valor, exposing himself to all\r\nthe risks of the battle and afterward of the sea. He did not receive\r\nany reward for his services, nor any salary, expenses, or any other\r\nrecompense. On the contrary, he contributed and spent his own property\r\nto provide all the necessary equipment for the said expedition,\r\nand also assisted some volunteers who went with him. Of the booty\r\ntaken from the corsair's almiranta, which was brought to this city,\r\nhe refused to take nor did he take anything; on the contrary, the share\r\nwhich should have fallen to him, he ceded and passed over to the king,\r\nour sovereign, and to his royal exchequer. Thus our aim and object,\r\nnamely, the destroying and defeating of the said corsair, has been\r\naccomplished, so much to the service of God and of his Majesty, and to\r\nthe welfare of this kingdom, as is more minutely set forth by acts,\r\ndepositions, and other inquiries concerning this expedition. At the\r\nrequest of the said Doctor Antonio de Morga, I gave him the present,\r\nwith my signature attached, and sealed with the seal of my arms. Given\r\nin Manila, August twenty-four, one thousand six hundred and one.\r\n\r\nDON FRANCISCO TELLO\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nIn the same year of one thousand six hundred, two merchantships left\r\nManila for Nueva España: the flagship the \"Sancta Margarita,\" with Juan\r\nMartinez de Guillestigui as general, who had arrived the year before\r\nin the same capacity; and the \"San Geronimo,\" under Don Fernando de\r\nCastro. On their way, both ships met with storms in the latitude of\r\nthirty-eight degrees and at six hundred leguas from the Filipinas,\r\nand suffered great hardship. At the end of nine months at sea, after\r\nmany of the men had died and much of the merchandise had been thrown\r\noverboard and lost, the \"San Geronimo\" put back to the Filipinas, off\r\nthe islands of Catenduanes, outside of the channel of Espiritu Santo,\r\nand there was wrecked, although the crew were saved. The flagship\r\n\"Sancta Margarita,\" after the death of the general and most of the\r\ncrew, ported at the Ladrones Islands and anchored at Zarpana. There\r\nnatives who went to the ships, seeing it so abandoned and battered,\r\nboarded and took possession of it, and of its goods and property. The\r\nfew men whom they found alive, they took away to their settlements,\r\nwhere they killed some and apportioned others to various villages,\r\nwhere they maintained them and gave them better treatment. The Indians\r\nwore the gold chains and other things of the ship around their necks,\r\nand then hung them to the trees and in their houses, like people who\r\nhad no knowledge of their value. [144]\r\n\r\nIn the month of May of the year six hundred and one, the galleon \"Santo\r\nTomas\" arrived at the Filipinas from Nueva España with passengers,\r\nsoldiers, and the return proceeds of the merchandise which had been\r\ndelayed in Mexico. Its general was Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera\r\nMaldonado, who had been appointed auditor of Manila. A small patache\r\nhad sailed in company with the galleon from the port of Acapulco,\r\nbut being unable to sail as rapidly as the \"Santo Tomas,\" after a few\r\ndays' voyage, it dropped behind. When they arrived off the Ladrones\r\nIslands, some natives went out, as usual, to meet the ship in their\r\nboats, and brought with them five Spaniards of the crew of the ship\r\n\"Sancta Margarita,\" which had been lost there the year before. The\r\nloss of that vessel was learned from those men; also that as many\r\nas twenty-six Spaniards were living in the towns of those islands;\r\nand that if the ship would wait, the natives would bring them.\r\n\r\nThe religious and men with the general tried to persuade him, since the\r\nweather was calm, to wait in that place, in order to take these men\r\nfrom those islands, where they had lingered for a year. Certain more\r\ncourageous persons even offered to go ashore to get them either in\r\nthe galleon's boat or in the vessels of the Ladrones themselves. But\r\nthe general would not allow this, believing that time would be lost,\r\nand his expedition exposed to peril. Without leave from the general,\r\nFray Juan Pobre, a lay-brother, who was in charge of the discalced\r\nreligious of St. Francis, who were coming on that occasion to the\r\nFilipinas, jumped into one of the Ladrones' vessels, and was taken by\r\nthe Indians to the island of Guan, where he remained with the Spaniards\r\nwhom he found. The galleon \"Santo Tomas,\" without further delay,\r\npursued its voyage, to the great grief and regret of the Spaniards on\r\nshore, who saw themselves left among those barbarians, where some of\r\nthem died later of illness and other hardships. The galleon reached\r\nthe Filipinas, making for the cape of Espiritu Santo and the harbor of\r\nCapul, at the conjunction of the moon and change of the weather. The\r\nland was so covered with thick fogs, that the ship was upon it before\r\nit was seen, nor did the pilots and sailors know the country or place\r\nwhere they were. They ran toward the Catenduanes, and entered a bay,\r\ncalled Catamban, [145] twenty leguas from the channel, where they\r\nfound themselves embayed and with so much wind and sea astern of\r\nthem, that the galleon ran upon some rocks near the land and came\r\nvery near being wrecked that night with all aboard. At daybreak,\r\nthe general went ashore with the small boat and had the ship made\r\nfast to some rocks. As the weather did not improve, and the ship was\r\nhourly in greater danger of being wrecked, and the cables with which\r\nit was made fast had given way, he determined to disembark the cargo\r\nthere, and as quickly as possible, by means of the boat. They went\r\nto work immediately and took off the people, the silver, and the\r\ngreater part of the goods and property, until, with native boats,\r\nthe Spaniards and Indians of that province carried everything to\r\nManila over a distance of eighty leguas, partly by sea and partly\r\nby land. They left the ship--a new and handsome one--wrecked there,\r\nwithout being able to derive any profit whatever from it.\r\n\r\nThe daring and audacity of the Mindanaos and Joloans in making\r\nincursions with their fleets into the islands of Pintados had reached\r\nsuch a state that it was now expected that they would come as far\r\nas Manila, plundering and devastating. In order to check them, at\r\nthe beginning of the year six hundred and two, Governor Don Francisco\r\nTello, deriving strength from weakness, determined that the expedition\r\nagainst Jolo should be made at once, without more delay, in order\r\nto punish and pacify it, with the forces and men whom Captain and\r\nSargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato held in Sebu and in the Pintados,\r\ntogether with more men, ships, and provisions, which were sent him,\r\naccompanied by the necessary documents and instructions for him to\r\nenter the island, chastise its king and inhabitants, and pacify and\r\nreduce it to the obedience of his Majesty. By this means, until there\r\nshould be an opportunity to settle the affairs of Mindanao, which is\r\nquite near Jolo, the audacity of the enemy would be checked; and by\r\nbringing the war into his own country, he would not come out to commit\r\ndepredations. Captain Gallinato set out on this expedition with two\r\nhundred Spanish soldiers, ships, artillery, enough provisions for four\r\nmonths--the time which it was thought the expedition would last--and\r\nwith Indians as rowers for the ships and for other services that might\r\narise. When he arrived at Jolo, at the bar of the river of this island,\r\nwhich is two leguas from the principal town and dwellings of the king,\r\nhe landed his men, artillery, and the necessary provisions and left\r\nhis ships under a sufficient guard. The islanders were all in the town\r\nand dwellings of the king, which are situated on a very high hill\r\nabove some cliffs, and have two roads of approach through paths and\r\nroads so narrow that they can be reached only in single file. They had\r\nfortified the whole place, intrenched it with palms and other woods,\r\nand a number of culverins. They had also collected provisions and\r\nwater for their sustenance, besides a supply of arquebuses and other\r\nweapons. They had neither women nor children with them, for they had\r\ntaken them out of the island. They had requested aid from the people\r\nof Mindanao, Borney, and Terrenate, and were awaiting the same, since\r\nthey had been informed of the fleet which was being prepared against\r\nthem in the Pintados. Gallinato determined to pitch his camp near the\r\ntown, before this aid should arrive, and to attack the fort. After\r\nhe had quartered himself at a distance of one-half legua, in a plain\r\nfacing the ascent, he sent interpreters with messages to the king and\r\nchiefs of the island, calling on them to surrender, and telling them\r\nthat good terms would be given them. While waiting for an answer,\r\nhe fortified his quarters in that spot, intrenching himself wherever\r\nnecessary. He mounted the artillery in the best position for use,\r\nand kept his men ready for any emergency. A false and deceptive answer\r\nwas returned, making excuses for the excesses that had been committed,\r\nand for not complying just then with what had been asked of them, and\r\nmaking loud promises to do so later. All this was with the object of\r\ndetaining the captain in that place, which is very unhealthy, until the\r\nrains should set in, his provisions run short, and the arrival of the\r\nexpected aid. After this answer had been received the Joloans, thinking\r\nthat the Spaniards had become more careless on account of it, swarmed\r\ndown quickly from the said fort in a large body of probably somewhat\r\nover one thousand; and armed with arquebuses and other weapons with\r\nhandles, campilans, and caraças, attacked and assaulted the quarters\r\nand camp of the Spaniards. This could not be done so secretly as not\r\nto be seen by the Spaniards, and allow them opportunity to prepare\r\nto receive the Joloans before their arrival. This the Spaniards did,\r\nand having permitted the natives to come all together in a body to\r\nthe very inside of the quarters and trenches, as soon as the Joloans\r\nhad discharged their arquebuses, the Spaniards opened fire upon them,\r\nfirst with their artillery, and then with their arquebuses, killing\r\nmany, and forcing the rest to retire in flight to the fort. The\r\nSpaniards pursued them, wounding and killing to the middle of the\r\nhill. But seeing that farther on the paths were so narrow and rough,\r\nthey retreated before the heavy artillery fire from the heights,\r\nand the large stones hurled down upon them, and returned to their\r\nquarters. Upon many other days, efforts were made to reach the fort,\r\nbut without any result. Thereupon Gallinato, in consideration of the\r\nwar being prolonged beyond what had been expected, built two forts,\r\none where he kept his ships in order to defend them and the port;\r\nand the other one-half legua farther on in a suitable place where\r\nthey could take refuge and communicate with the camp. The forts were\r\nbuilt of wood and fascines, and fortified with the artillery from the\r\nships. The Spaniards shut themselves up in these forts, whence from\r\ntime to time they sallied, making incursions as far as the enemy's\r\nfort. The latter always remained shut up in their fort without ever\r\nchoosing to come down or to yield; for he was convinced that the\r\nSpaniards could not remain long in the island. When Gallinato saw\r\nthat the rains were fast setting in, that his men were becoming ill,\r\nand that his provisions were failing, without his having accomplished\r\nthe desired task, and that it could not be accomplished with his\r\nremaining resources; and that the enemy from Mindanao with other\r\nallies of theirs were boasting that they were gathering a large fleet\r\nin order to drive the Spaniards from Jolo: he sent news of all that had\r\noccurred to the governor of Manila, with a plan of the island and fort\r\nand a relation of the difficulties which the enterprise presented. He\r\nsent this in a swift vessel, by Captain and Sargento-mayor Pedro\r\nCotelo de Morales, toward the end of May of the year six hundred\r\nand two, in order to obtain instructions as to his procedure, and\r\nthe necessary reënforcements of men and provisions. The captain was\r\ncharged to return quickly with the answer.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moro Ocuña Lacasamana and his followers killed Diego Belloso,\r\nBlas Ruyz de Hernan Gonçales, and the Castilians and Portuguese with\r\nthem in the kingdom of Camboja, we said that Joan de Mendoça Gamboa\r\nwith father Fray Joan Malclonado, and his associate, Don Antonio\r\nMalaver, Luys de Villafañe, and other Spaniards who escaped by\r\nembarking with him in his vessel, descended the river with his vessel\r\ntoward the sea, defending themselves against some Cambodian and Malayan\r\npraus which pursued them until they crossed the bar. Joan de Mendoça\r\npursued his voyage along the coast to Sian, where his main business\r\nlay. Having reached the bar he ascended the river to the city of Odia,\r\nthe court of the king, and the latter received the letter and message\r\nof Governor Don Francisco Tello, although with less pomp and courtesy\r\nthan Joan de Mendoça wished.\r\n\r\nThen he bartered his merchandise, and was so stingy in the regular\r\ncustom of making some presents and gifts to the king and his favorites\r\nthat he even bargained closely over the presents offered. The king\r\nwas even inclined to seize the artillery of his ship, for which he\r\nhad a great longing. Joan de Mendoça, fearing this, sunk it in the\r\nriver with buoys, so that he could recover it at his departure,\r\nand for appearances left in the ship only one iron gun and some\r\nculverins. There was a Portuguese of the Order of St. Dominic in\r\nOdia, who had been residing in that court for the last two years,\r\nadministering to the Portuguese who carried on trade in that\r\nregion. Among these Portuguese were some whom the king had brought\r\nfrom Camboja and Pigu, when at war with both kingdoms. These and other\r\nPortuguese had had some quarrels with Siamese in the city, and had\r\nkilled one of the king's servants. The king, being little inclined\r\nto clemency, had fried some of the delinquents and had forbidden\r\nthe other Portuguese and the religious to leave the city or kingdom,\r\nalthough they had urgently asked leave and permission to do so. On\r\nseeing themselves deprived of liberty, less well treated than before,\r\nand threatened daily, they conspired with Fray Joan Maldonado to be\r\nsmuggled aboard his vessel at its departure, and taken out of the\r\nkingdom. The religious took the matter upon himself. After Joan de\r\nMendoça had concluded his business, although not as he had desired,\r\nsince the king gave him no answer for the governor, putting it off,\r\nand his merchandise had not yielded much profit, he determined, at the\r\nadvice of Fray Joan Maldonado, to recover his artillery some night,\r\nand to descend the river as rapidly as possible. On that same night\r\nthe Portuguese religious and his companions, about twelve in number,\r\nwere to leave the city secretly and wait eight leguas down the river\r\nin an appointed place, where they would be taken aboard. This plan\r\nwas carried out, but when the king heard that Don Joan de Mendoça had\r\ntaken his ship and departed without his leave and dismissal, and that\r\nhe was carrying away the friar and the Portuguese who had been kept at\r\nhis court, he was so angered that he sent forty praus with artillery\r\nand many soldiers in pursuit of him with orders to capture and bring\r\nthem back to court or to kill them. Although Joan de Mendoça made all\r\npossible haste to descend the river, the ship, being without oars and\r\nits sails not always to be depended upon, and the distance to cover\r\nmore than seventy leguas, he was overtaken by the Siamese in the\r\nriver. When they drew near, Joan de Mendoça assumed the defensive,\r\nand gave them so much trouble with his artillery and musketry,\r\nthat they did not dare to board him. Nevertheless, they approached\r\nhim several times, and managing to break through, tossed artificial\r\nfire aboard, which caused the Spaniards much trouble, for the combat\r\nlasted more than one week, day and night. Finally, when near the bar,\r\nin order that the ship might not escape them, all the praus surviving\r\nthe previous engagements attacked with one accord and made the last\r\neffort in their power. Although the Siamese could not carry out their\r\nintentions, and suffered the more killed and wounded, the Spaniards\r\ndid not escape without severe losses; for the pilot, Joan Martinez de\r\nChave, the associate of Fray Joan Maldonado, and eight other Spaniards\r\ndied in the conflict. Fray Joan Maldonado was badly wounded by a ball\r\nfrom a culverin, which shattered his arm, and Captain Joan de Mendoça\r\nalso received dangerous wounds. Thereupon the Siamese reascended the\r\nriver, and the ship put to sea badly misused. As the weather was not\r\nfavorable for crossing by way of the shoals to Manila or Malaca, which\r\nlay nearer to them, they steered for Cochinchina, where they put in\r\nand joined a Portuguese vessel lying there, for which they waited until\r\nit should sail to Malaca, in order to sail in its company. There Fray\r\nJoan Maldonado and Captain Joan de Mendoça grew worse of their wounds,\r\nand both died. Fray Joan Maldonado left a letter, written a few days\r\nbefore his death, for his superior and the Order of St. Dominic, in\r\nwhich he related his journeys, hardships and the cause of his death;\r\nand informed them of the nature and condition of the affairs of Camboja\r\n(whither he had been sent), of the slight foundation and motives for\r\nthem troubling themselves with that enterprise, and the slight gain\r\nwhich could be hoped from it. He charged them upon their consciences\r\nnot again to become instruments of a return to Camboja. The ship\r\nwent to Malaca with its cargo, where everything was sold there by the\r\nprobate judge. Some of the Spaniards still living returned to Manila\r\nsick, poor, and needy, from the hardships which they had undergone.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Maluco continued to assume a worse appearance,\r\nbecause the ruler of Terrenate was openly waging war against his\r\nneighbor of Tidore and against the Portuguese who were with the\r\nlatter. He had allowed some ships which had come to Terrenate from\r\nthe islands of Holanda and Zelanda by way of India to trade with\r\nhim, and through them had sent a message to Inglaterra and to the\r\nprince of Orange, concerning peace, trade, and commerce with the\r\nEnglish and the Dutch. To this he had received a favorable answer,\r\nand he expected shortly a large fleet from Inglaterra and the islands,\r\nwith whose help he expected to accomplish great things against Tidore\r\nand the Filipinas. Meanwhile, he kept some Flemings and Englishmen\r\nin Terrenate who had remained as pledges, and a factor engaged in\r\npurchasing cloves. These people had brought many fine weapons for this\r\ntrade, so that the island of Terrenate was exceedingly well supplied\r\nwith them. The king of Tidore and the chief captain wrote yearly to\r\nthe governor of the Filipinas, informing him of what was going on,\r\nso that it might be remedied in time, and aid sent to them. Once,\r\nCachilcota, [146] brother of the king of Tidore, a brave soldier\r\nand one of the most famous of all Maluco, came to Manila for that\r\npurpose. They always received men, provisions, and some ammunition;\r\nbut what they most desired was that an expedition should be made\r\nopportunely against Terrenate, before the English and Dutch came\r\nwith the expected fleet. This could not be done without an order\r\nfrom his Majesty, and great preparation and equipment for such an\r\nenterprise. The same message was always sent from Tidore. At last,\r\nduring this administration of Don Francisco Tello, Captain Marcos\r\nDias de Febra returned with this request, and brought letters to the\r\ngovernor and to the Audiencia from the king [of Tidore], and from\r\nthe chief captain, Rui Gonçales de Sequeira, in which were detailed\r\ncontemporaneous events, and the necessity of at least sending succor\r\nto Tidore. The king wrote specially about this to the king [of España]\r\nand to Doctor Antonio de Morga, with the latter of whom he used to\r\ncorrespond, the following letter, which was written in Portuguese\r\nand signed in his own language.\r\n\r\nTo Doctor Morga, in the Filipinas Islands, from the king of Tidore.\r\n\r\nI greatly rejoiced in receiving a letter from your Grace written on\r\nthe eighth of November last, because by it I particularly understand\r\nyour great sincerity in remembering me and my affairs; for this, may\r\nGod reward your Grace with long life and prosperity for the service\r\nof the king, my sovereign. For I understood that he keeps your Grace\r\nin these islands with the hope of their increase, and I am aware that\r\nyour being there will serve as a remedy for this fortress and island of\r\nTidore. I have written to the governor and to the Audiencia in Manila,\r\nconcerning the succor for which I beg, for I have asked it so often,\r\non account of the great necessity of it; for through its means the\r\ninjury may be checked; otherwise it may later cost much to the king\r\nour sovereign. I beg your Grace to favor me in this, or at least in\r\nwhat may be necessary for the future, for thus it will render a great\r\nservice to God and to the king, my sovereign. May God preserve your\r\nGrace with life for many years. From this island of Tidore, today,\r\nMarch eight, one thousand six hundred and one.\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF TIDORE\r\n\r\nThe bearer, namely, Marcos Dias, will give your Grace a flagon and a\r\nlittle flask of Moorish brass workmanship. I send them in order that\r\nyour Grace may remember this your friend. [147]\r\n\r\nMarcos Dias returned to Tidore at the first monsoon, in the beginning\r\nof the year six hundred and two, bearing an answer to his message,\r\nand taking the reënforcements that had been asked, of provisions,\r\nammunition, and a few soldiers. He was satisfied therewith, until a\r\nfitting opportunity should offer for making the desired expedition\r\nfrom Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the government of Don Pedro de Acuña, governor and president\r\nof the Filipinas, and of what happened during his administration,\r\nuntil his death in June of the year six hundred and six, after his\r\nreturn to Manila from Maluco, where he had completed the conquest of\r\nthe islands subject to the king of Terrenate.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH\r\n\r\nIn the month of May of six hundred and two, four ships came to Manila\r\nfrom Nueva España, with a new governor and president of the Audiencia,\r\nnamed Don Pedro de Acuña, knight of the Order of St. John, comendador\r\nof Salamanca, and lately governor of Cartagena in Tierra Firme. He was\r\nreceived into the government to the great satisfaction of the whole\r\ncountry, on account of the need there of one who would be as skilled\r\nin matters of war as watchful and careful in the government. Don\r\nFrancisco Tello, his predecessor, awaiting his residencia which\r\nwas to be taken, had to remain in Manila until the following year,\r\nsix hundred and three, and in the month of April he died of an acute\r\nillness. The new governor, upon seeing things in so great need of\r\nstability, and so limited resources in the royal treasury for the\r\npurpose, found that his lot was not so good as he had imagined when\r\nhe had been appointed; since the state of affairs obliged him to risk\r\na part of his reputation without his being able to remedy matters\r\nas quickly as was to be desired. He took heart as much as possible,\r\nhowever, and without sparing himself any personal labor in whatever\r\npresented itself, he began with what was to be done in Manila and\r\nits environs. He began to construct galleys and other vessels in\r\nthe shipyard, for there was great need of these, in order to defend\r\nthe sea, which was full of enemies and pirates from other islands,\r\nespecially from Mindanao. He discussed going immediately in person\r\nto visit the provinces of Pintados, in order to supply more quickly\r\nthe needs of that region, which was causing the greatest anxiety. But\r\nhe had to postpone that several months to arrange for the despatch of\r\nJapon and Jolo matters, and for the ships which were to make the voyage\r\nto Nueva España, all of which came at once and had to be seen to.\r\n\r\nChiquiro, the Japanese, having arrived in Manila, delivered his\r\nmessage and present to Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, who had been in\r\nthe government but a few days. The matter and its determination,\r\ntogether with the reply, were immediately considered. It required\r\nthe greatest amount of thought to decide how this was to be made,\r\nin the most fitting manner possible. For, although friendship with\r\nDaifusama was held to be a good thing and of great profit, and a\r\nnecessity to obtain and conclude, even should certain difficulties\r\nhave to be overcome; and although the sailing to Quanto and its\r\ncommerce were not of much account to the Spaniards; nevertheless\r\nthose things would be fulfilled by sending a ship there with some\r\ngoods for exchange. But the rest, namely, the trade and friendship\r\nwith Nueva España, and the sending of masters and workmen to build\r\nships in Japon for that navigation, which Daifu insisted upon, and\r\nwhich Fray Geronymo had assured him would be done, was a serious\r\nmatter and impossible to be carried out, as it was very harmful\r\nand prejudicial to the Filipinas. For their greatest security from\r\nJapon had ever been the Japanese lack of ships and their ignorance\r\nof navigation. As often as the latter had intended to attack Manila,\r\nthey had been prevented by this obstacle. Now to send the Japanese\r\nworkmen and masters to make Spanish ships for them and show them how\r\nsuch vessels were made, would be to give them the weapons that they\r\nneeded for their own [i.e., the Filipinas'] destruction, while their\r\nnavigation to Nueva España, and making long voyages, would cause very\r\ngreat troubles. [148] Each matter singly was of great importance and\r\nconsideration, and such that the governor could not decide them, and\r\nthey could not be decided in Manila, without informing his Majesty\r\nand the latter's viceroy of Nueva España, who was so much concerned,\r\nthereof. In order to take measures in the matter, and not to delay the\r\nJapanese from returning with his reply, a moderate present of Spanish\r\narticles was sent to Daifu, in the same ship which had come, in return\r\nfor what it had brought. These Fray Geronymo was to give Daifu in\r\nperson. The former was written to tell Daifu with what pleasure the\r\ngovernor received the good-will that he manifested to him, and the\r\npeace and friendship with the Spaniards, and all the other things that\r\nhe was doing for them; and that he, the governor, would keep it and\r\nobserve it in so far as he was concerned, and that very year he would\r\nsend a Spanish ship to trade at Quanto according to Daifu's desire,\r\nand that he would despatch it quickly. As to the navigation which\r\nthe latter wished to undertake to Nueva España and his desire to have\r\nmasters sent him for that purpose, to build ships for that voyage, that\r\nwas a matter which--although the governor would do his best to effect,\r\nand to please him in everything--was not within his control, without\r\nfirst informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva España\r\nthereof; for he, the governor, had no power or authority outside of\r\nthe affairs of his government of the Filipinas. He said that he would\r\nwrite and would treat of it immediately, and hoped that it would be\r\nproperly settled there. Until the reply came from España, which would\r\nnecessarily have to be delayed three years, because that country was\r\nso far, he begged Daifu to be patient and suffer it, since it was not\r\nin his control, and nothing else could be done. The governor wrote\r\nFray Geronymo to humor Daifu in everything, with the best words he\r\ncould use to please him, but not to embarrass himself thenceforward by\r\npromising him and expediting such things for him. With this despatch,\r\nChiquiro sailed for Japon with his ship, but was so unfortunate\r\non the voyage that he was wrecked off the head of Hermosa Island,\r\nand neither the vessel nor its crew escaped. News thereof was not\r\nreceived in Manila or in Japon until many days afterward.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the letters from Fray Geronymo de Jesus, and the\r\nnews of the changed conditions which he wrote existed in Japon, and the\r\npermission which he said that Daifu had given him to make Christians\r\nand build churches, not only the discalced religious of St. Francis\r\nbut those of the other orders of St. Dominic and St. Augustine, set\r\nabout going to Japon without loss of time; and, in order to be taken,\r\neach one made use of the Japanese ships and captains which were then\r\nat Manila, having come with flour, and which were about to return. In\r\nparticular, the Order of St. Dominic sent to the kingdom of Zazuma\r\nfour religious, under Fray Francisco de Morales, [149] Prior of Manila,\r\nin a ship about to go to that island and province. They said that they\r\nhad been summoned by its king, the only one who had not yet rendered\r\nhomage to Daifusama. The Order of St. Augustine sent two religious to\r\nthe kingdom of Firando in a ship which had come from that port, under\r\nFray Diego de Guebara, [150] Prior of Manila, because they had heard\r\nthat they would be well received by the king of that province. The\r\nOrder of St. Francis, in the ships about to sail to Nangasaqui,\r\nsent Fray Augustin Rodrigues, [151] who had been in Japon before,\r\nin company with the martyrs, and a lay-brother, with orders to go to\r\nMiaco, to become associates of Fray Geronymo de Jesus. Although some\r\ndifficulties presented themselves to the governor in regard to the\r\ndeparture of these religious from Manila, and their going to Japon\r\nso hastily, yet on account of the great pressure which they brought\r\nto bear upon him, these were not sufficient to cause him to refuse\r\nthem the permission which they requested. The religious reached the\r\nprovinces to which they were going and were received there, although\r\nmore coolly than they had expected, and with fewer conveniences than\r\nthey needed for their support, and less inclination than they desired\r\nfor the matters of the conversion, in which they had imagined that\r\nthey were to have great and immediate results, for very few of the\r\nJapanese became Christians. In fact, the kings and tonos of those\r\nprovinces kept them in order, by means of them, to open intercourse\r\nand commerce in their lands with the Spaniards--which they desired\r\nfor their own interests rather than for the religion, to which they\r\nwere not inclined.\r\n\r\nThe governor, Don Pedro de Acuña, in fulfilment of his letter,\r\nnamely, that he would send a ship to Quanto, prepared and then sent\r\nout a medium-sized ship, named \"Santiago el Menor\" [i.e., St. James\r\nthe Less], with a captain and the necessary seamen and officers, and\r\nsome goods consisting of red wood, [152] deerskins, raw silk [153]\r\nand other things. This ship set out with orders to go to Quanto,\r\nwhere it would find discalced Franciscan religious and there to sell\r\nits goods and return with the exchange--and with the permission of\r\nDaifusama--to Manila. Thus Japanese matters were provided for, as\r\nfar as seemed necessary, according to the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nDaifusama, sovereign of Japon, who was awaiting Chiquiro, his servant,\r\nwhom he had sent to Manila with the letters from Fray Geronymo de\r\nJesus, pressed the latter so closely concerning the things which he\r\ndesired and about which he had treated with him, that Fray Geronymo,\r\nseeing that Chiquiro was slow in returning, and that few arguments\r\nwere of avail with Daifu, in order to satisfy him the better,\r\nrequested permission of him to go to Manila in person, there to\r\ncommunicate and conclude matters with the governor by word of mouth,\r\nand bring a reply to him. He said that he would leave at the court Fray\r\nAugustin Rodriguez and another companion, who had lately come to him,\r\nas hostages for his return. The king granted the permission and gave\r\nhim provision, so that Fray Geronymo came quickly to Manila, where\r\nhe learned of the message which Chiquiro had taken. Then he began to\r\ntreat with Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, about his business, saying\r\nthat Chiquiro had not yet arrived in Xapon, which gave rise to the\r\nsuspicion that he had been wrecked. The ship sent by the governor being\r\nunable to double the head of Xapon in order to pass to the north side,\r\nput into the port of Firando, where the religious of St. Augustine\r\nhad had a station for a short time, and anchored there. Thence the\r\ncaptain advised the court of Miaco that he had been unable to reach\r\nQuanto. He sent also the letters for the religious and what was to\r\nbe given to Daifu. The religious, Fray Geronymo's associates, gave\r\nDaifu the presents which were for him, and told him that the governor\r\nwas sending that ship at his disposition and command, but that the\r\nweather had not allowed it to reach Quanto. Daifusama received the\r\npresents, although he did not believe what they told him, but that\r\nthey were compliments to please him. He ordered the ship to get its\r\ntrading done immediately, and to return with some things which he gave\r\nthem for the governor, and thenceforward to go to Quanto as promised\r\nhim. Thereupon it returned to Manila.\r\n\r\nFray Geronymo de Jesus reached the Filipinas so quickly, as has\r\nbeen said, that he had opportunity to treat with Governor Don Pedro\r\nde Acuña, about the matters under his charge, from whom he received\r\nthe promise that ships would continue to be sent to Quanto to please\r\nDaifusama. Taking with him a good present, given him by the governor,\r\nconsisting of a very rich and large Venetian mirror, glass, clothes\r\nfrom Castilla, honey, several tibores, [154] and other things which it\r\nwas known would please Daifu, he returned immediately to Japon. He was\r\nwell received there by Daifu, to whom he communicated his message, and\r\nthat his servant Chiquiro had been well sent off by the new governor,\r\nand that nothing less than shipwreck was possible, since he had not\r\nappeared in so long a time. He gave Daifu what he had brought, which\r\npleased the latter greatly.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of the governor's administration he found in\r\nthe shipyard of Cabit two large ships which were being finished to\r\nmake their voyage that year to Nueva España. One of them, belonging\r\nto Don Luys Dasmariñas, by an agreement which the latter had made\r\nwith the governor's predecessor, Don Francisco Tello, was to go with a\r\ncargo of merchandise. The other, called the \"Espiritu Santo,\" built by\r\nJoan Tello de Aguirre and other residents of Manila, was to make the\r\nvoyage with the merchandise of that year credited to the builders,\r\nbut was to pass into possession of his Majesty on its arrival in\r\nNueva España, according to an agreement and contract made with the\r\nsame governor, Don Francisco Tello. Don Pedro de Acuña made so great\r\nhaste in despatching both ships that, with the cargo which they were\r\nto carry, he sent them out of port at the beginning of July of the\r\naforesaid year six hundred and two, with Don Lope de Ulloa in the\r\n\"Espiritu Santo\" as general, and Don Pedro Flores in charge of the\r\n\"Jesus Maria.\" Both ships went on their way, and in thirty-eight\r\ndegrees met such storms that they were many times on the point of being\r\nwrecked, and threw overboard a quantity of their merchandise. The ship\r\n\"Jesus Maria\" put back into Manila with difficulty after having been\r\nmore than forty days in the island of the Ladrones, whence it was\r\nunable to depart. During this time they had opportunity to pick up\r\nall the surviving Spaniards from among those left by the ship \"Santa\r\nMargarita,\" among them, Fray Joan Pobre, who had jumped into one\r\nof the boats of the natives from the galleon \"Santo Tomas,\" when it\r\npassed that way the year before. Five other Spaniards were in other\r\nislands of the same Ladrones, but although every effort was made to\r\nbring them, they could not come. The natives brought Fray Joan Pobre\r\nand the others to the ship in their own boats, with great friendship\r\nand good will. After they had been entertained on board the ship, which\r\nthey entered without fear, and after iron and other presents had been\r\ngiven to them, they returned without the Spaniards, weeping and showing\r\ngreat sorrow. The ship \"Espiritu Santo,\" with the same difficulty,\r\nput into Japon, as it could do nothing else, with its mainmast gone,\r\nand entered a port of Firando, twenty leguas from a station of the\r\nreligious of St. Augustine, who had gone there the same year from\r\nManila, and where also the ship bound for Quanto had entered. The\r\nharbor could be sounded [i.e., it formed a good anchorage], but\r\nto enter and leave it were very difficult, because its channel had\r\nmany turns, with rocks and high mountains on both sides. However,\r\nas the Japanese natives with their funeas towed and guided the ship\r\nso that it might enter, it had less difficulty. When it was inside,\r\na Japanese guard was placed on the ship, and those who went ashore\r\nwere not allowed to return to the ship. The supplies furnished them\r\ndid not suffice for all their necessities, and the price was not\r\nsuitable. On this account, and because a large number of soldiers had\r\nassembled quickly at the port from the whole district, and had asked\r\nthe general for the sails of the ship, which he had always declined\r\nto give them, he feared that they wished to seize the ship and its\r\nmerchandise, as was done in Hurando, with the ship \"San Felipe,\"\r\nin the year ninety-six. He acted with caution, and kept much closer\r\nwatch thenceforward, without leaving his ship or allowing his men\r\nto leave it alone, or any of the merchandise to be unloaded. At the\r\nsame time he sent his brother, Don Alonso de Ulloa, and Don Antonio\r\nMaldonado to Miaco with a reasonable present for Daifusama, that he\r\nmight have provision given them and permission to go out again from\r\nthat harbor. [155] These men made the journey by land. Meanwhile,\r\nthose on the ship were greatly troubled by the Japanese who were in the\r\nport, and by their captains, who were not satisfied with the presents\r\nwhich were given them to make them well disposed, but forcibly seized\r\nwhatever they saw, giving out that everything was theirs and that it\r\nwould soon be in their power. Fray Diego de Guebara, the Augustinian\r\nsuperior in Firando, came to the ship and told the general that he had\r\nput into a bad harbor of infidels and wicked people, who would take\r\nhis ship and rob it, and that he should endeavor with all his might\r\nto get it out of there and take it to Firando where he [the father]\r\nwas living. Meanwhile he told him to be on the watch and guard to the\r\nbest of his ability. As the father was returning to his house with\r\nsome pieces of silk, given him on the ship for his new church and\r\nmonastery at Firando, the Japanese took it away from him and did not\r\nleave him a thing, saying that it was all theirs, and he went away\r\nwithout it. About a dozen and a half of the Spaniards of the ship\r\nwere ashore, where they were kept in confinement and not allowed to\r\ngo on board again, and although the general warned them that he had\r\ndetermined to leave the port as soon as possible, and that they should\r\nmake every effort to come to the ship, they could not all do so,\r\nbut only four or five of them. Without waiting any longer he drove\r\nthe Japanese guard from the ship, bent the foresail and spritsail,\r\nloaded the artillery, and, with weapons in hand, one morning set the\r\nship in readiness to weigh anchor. The Japanese went to the channel at\r\nthe mouth of the harbor with many funeas and arquebusiers, stretched\r\na thick rattan cable which they had woven, and moored it on both banks\r\nin order that the ship might not be able to sail out. The general sent\r\na small boat with six arquebusiers to find out what they were doing,\r\nbut at their approach, a number of the Japanese funeas attacked them\r\nwith the purpose of capturing them. However, by defending themselves\r\nwith their arquebuses they returned to the ship and reported to the\r\ngeneral that the Japanese were closing the exit from the harbor with\r\na cable. Taking this to be a bad sign, the ship immediately set sail\r\nagainst the cable to break it, and a negro, to whom the general\r\npromised his freedom, offered to be let down over the bow with a\r\nlarge machete in order to cut the cable when the ship should reach it.\r\n\r\nWith the artillery and the arquebuses he cleared the channel of the\r\nfuneas there, and when he came to the cable, with the impetus of\r\nthe vessel and the strenuous efforts of the negro with the machete,\r\nit broke, and the ship passed through. It still remained for it to go\r\nthrough the many turns which the channel made before coming out to the\r\nsea and it seemed impossible for a ship which was sailing fast to go\r\nthrough them, but God permitted it to pass out through them as though\r\nit had had a breeze for each turn. But the Japanese, who had assembled\r\nin great numbers on the hills and rocks within range of where the ship\r\nwas passing, did not fail to annoy the ship with many volleys, with\r\nwhich they killed one Spaniard on the ship and wounded others. The\r\nship did the same, and with their artillery they killed several of\r\nthe Japanese. The Japanese failed to obstruct the ship's passage, and\r\naccordingly were left without it. The general, finding himself on the\r\nsea and free from the past danger, and seeing that it was beginning\r\nto blow a little from the north, thought it best to venture on his\r\nvoyage to Manila rather than to seek another harbor in Japon. Having\r\nraised a jury-mast [156] in place of the main-mast, and with the wind\r\nfreshening daily from the north, he crossed to Luzón in twelve days,\r\nvia the cape of Bojeador, and reached the mouth of the bay of Manila,\r\nwhere he found the ship \"Jesus Maria,\" which was also putting in in\r\ndistress through the Capul Channel; and so the two ships together,\r\nas they had gone together out of the port of Cabit five months before,\r\nmade harbor there again in distress after having suffered many damages\r\nand losses to the exchequer.\r\n\r\nDon Alonso de Ulloa and Don Francisco Maldonado, while this was going\r\non in the harbor where they had left the ship \"Espiritu Santo,\" reached\r\nMiaco and delivered their message and present to Daifusama. The latter,\r\nupon being informed who they were, that their ship had entered Japon,\r\nand that they were from Manila, received them cordially, and quickly\r\ngave them warrants and chapas [i.e., safe-conducts], in order that the\r\ntonos and governors of the provinces where the ship had entered should\r\nallow it and its crew to depart freely. They were to be allowed to\r\nrefit, and to be given what they needed; and whatever had been taken\r\nfrom them, whether much or little, was to be returned.\r\n\r\nWhile this matter was being attended to, news reached Miaco of the\r\ndeparture of the ship from the harbor, and the skirmish with the\r\nJapanese over it, and of this they complained anew to Diafu. He showed\r\nthat he was troubled at the departure of the ship and the discourtesy\r\nto it, and at the outrages committed by the Japanese. He gave new\r\nchapas for restitution of all the goods to be made; and sent a catan\r\nfrom his own hand with which justice should be performed upon those\r\nwho had offended in this matter, [157] and ordered that the Spaniards\r\nwho remained in the port should be set free, and that their goods\r\nbe returned to them. With this warrant the Spaniards left that port\r\nand recovered what had been taken from them. The ambassadors and the\r\nothers returned to Manila in the first vessels which left, taking with\r\nthem eight chapas of the same tenor from Daifusama, in order that in\r\nthe future ships coming from Manila to any port whatever of J apon,\r\nmight be received courteously and well treated, without having any\r\nharm done them. These, upon their arrival in Manila, they handed over\r\nto the governor, who gives them to the ships sailing to Nueva España,\r\nto provide for any incidents on the voyage.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Governor Don Pedro de Acuña entered upon\r\nhis administration, the captain and sargento-mayor, Pedro Cotelo de\r\nMorales, arrived from Jolo with the advices and report of Joan Xuarez\r\nGallinato concerning the state of affairs in that island, whither\r\nhe had gone with the fleet at the beginning of that same year. The\r\ngovernor, on account of the importance of the matter, wished to make\r\nevery effort possible, and determined to send him supplies and a\r\nreënforcement of some men, which he did as soon as possible. He was\r\nordered to at least make an effort to punish that enemy, even if he\r\ncould do nothing more, and, whenever the opportunity presented itself,\r\nto go to do the same thing in the river of Mindanao, and return to the\r\nPintados. When this commission reached Jolo, Gallinato was already so\r\nworn out, and his men so ill, that the reënforcements only made it\r\npossible for him to get away from there; accordingly without seeing\r\nto another thing, he broke camp, burned the forts which he had built,\r\nembarked, and went to Pintados, leaving the people of that island of\r\nJolo and their neighbors, those of Mindanao, emboldened more than\r\never to make raids against the Pintados, and the islands within,\r\nwhich they did.\r\n\r\nThe governor, without delaying any longer in Manila, hastily started\r\nfor the island of Panay and the town of Arevalo, in a galliot and\r\nother small vessels, to see their needs with his own eyes, in order to\r\nprovide for them. He left war matters in Manila, during his absence, in\r\ncharge of Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera, auditor of the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the governor left Manila, the auditor had plenty to look\r\nafter, because a squadron of twenty caracoas and other vessels from\r\nMindanao entered the islands as far as the island of Luzon and its\r\ncoasts, making captures. Having taken some ships bound from Sebu to\r\nManila, they captured ten Spaniards in them, among them a woman and\r\na priest and Captain Martin de Mandia, and they took them off with\r\nthem. They entered Calilaya, burned the church and all the town,\r\nand captured many persons of all classes among the natives. Thence\r\nthey passed to the town of Valayan [Balayán] to do the same, but the\r\nauditor, having received news of the enemy in Manila, had it already\r\nin a state of defense with fifty Spaniards and a captain and some\r\nvessels. Consequently, they did not dare to enter the town or its\r\nbay, but crossed over to Mindoro, where, in the principal town, they\r\ncaptured many men, women, and children among the natives, seizing their\r\ngold and possessions, and burning their houses and church, where they\r\ncaptured theprebendary Corral, curate of that doctrina. They filled\r\ntheir own ships, and others which they seized there, with captives,\r\ngold, and property, staying in the port of Mindoro as leisurely as\r\nthough in their own land, notwithstanding that it is but twenty-four\r\nleguas from Manila. Captain Martin de Mendia, prisoner of these\r\npirates, offered for himself and the other Spanish captives that,\r\nif they would let him go to Manila, he would get the ransom for all,\r\nand would take it, or would send it within six months, to the river\r\nof Mindanao, or otherwise he would return to their power. The chief\r\nin command of the fleet agreed thereto, with certain provisions and\r\nconditions, and caused the other captives to write, to the effect\r\nthat what had been agreed upon might be fulfilled, and then he\r\nallowed the captain to leave the fleet. The latter came to the city,\r\nand upon receiving his report, the auditor sent munitions, ships,\r\nand more men to Valayan than there were there already, with orders\r\nto go in pursuit of the enemy without delay, saying that they would\r\nfind him in Mindoro. Captain Gaspar Perez, who had charge of this in\r\nValayan, did not start so quickly as he should have done in order\r\nto find the enemy in Mindoro, for when he arrived he found that he\r\nhad left that port six days before, laden with ships and booty, to\r\nreturn to Mindanao. Then he went in pursuit of him, although somewhat\r\nslowly. The enemy put into the river of a little uninhabited island\r\nto get water and wood. Just at that time Governor Don Pedro de Acuña,\r\nwho was hastily returning to Manila, from the town of Arvalo, where\r\nhe had learned of the incursion of those pirates, passed. He passed\r\nso near the mouth of this river, in two small champans and a virrey,\r\nwith very few men, that it was a wonder that he was not seen and\r\ncaptured by the enemy. He learned that the enemy was there, from a\r\nboat of natives which was escaping therefrom, and then he met Gaspar\r\nPerez going in search of the enemy with twelve vessels, caracoas and\r\nvireys, and some large champans. The governor made him make more haste\r\nand gave him some of his own men to guide him to where he had left\r\nthe pirates the day before, whereupon they went to attack them. But\r\nthe latter espied the fleet through their sentinels whom they had\r\nalready stationed in the sea, outside the river. Accordingly they\r\nleft the river in haste, and took to flight, throwing into the sea\r\ngoods and slaves in order to flee more lightly. Their flagship and\r\nalmiranta caracoas protected the ships which were dropping behind\r\nand made them throw overboard what they could and work with all\r\nthe strength of their paddles, assisted by their sails. The Spanish\r\nfleet, the vessels of which were not so light, could not put forth\r\nenough strength to overtake all of them, because, furthermore,\r\nthey went into the open without fear of the heavy seas which were\r\nrunning, inasmuch as they were fleeing. Yet some of the ships of\r\nCaptain Gaspar Perez, being lighter, got among the enemy's fleet,\r\nsunk some caracoas, and captured two, but the rest escaped, although\r\nwith great danger of being lost. Without accomplishing anything else,\r\nthe fleet returned to Manila where the governor had already entered,\r\nvery much disturbed that things should have come to such a pass that\r\nthese enemies, who had never dared to leave their houses, should have\r\nbeen so daring and bold as to come to the very gates of the city,\r\ndoing great damage and making captures.\r\n\r\nSome years before this his Majesty had ordered an expedition to be\r\nprepared in Portuguese India for the capture of the fort of Terrenate\r\nin Maluco, which was in the power of a Moro who had rebelled and\r\nsubjected it in a tyrannical manner, and had driven out the Portuguese\r\nthere. The necessary preparations of ships, munitions, and men were\r\nmade for this undertaking in India, and a hidalgo, named Andrea Furtado\r\nde Mendoça, [158] was chosen general of this expedition. He was a\r\nsoldier skilled in the affairs of India, who had won many victories\r\nof great importance and fame on sea and land in those parts, and had\r\nlately had a very notable one at Jabanapatan.  [159] He sailed from\r\nGoa with six galleons of the kingdom, fourteen galliots and fustas,\r\nand other ships, and one thousand five hundred fighting men, and with\r\nsupplies and munitions for the fleet. On account of the storms which\r\nhe met, his fleet was so scattered before reaching Amboino that the\r\ngalleys and fustas could not keep up with the galleons or follow them,\r\nand only three of them, in convoy of the galleons, reached Amboino. The\r\nother vessels put back into Goa and other forts on the line of that\r\nvoyage. The island of Amboino was in rebellion and the Portuguese\r\nfort there was in great need, so that, while the galliots, fustas,\r\nand other vessels of his fleet which had fallen off on the voyage were\r\ngathering, and while help was coming which he had sent to ask of the\r\nfort of Malaca, it seemed best to Andrea Furtado de Mendoça to stop\r\nin Amboino, which is eighty leguas from Maluco, in order to pacify\r\nthe island and some towns of the neighborhood, and reduce them to\r\nthe crown of Portugal. He was more than six months in this, having\r\nencounters with the enemy and with the rebels, in which he always\r\ncame out victorious, and from which he obtained the desired result,\r\nand left everything reduced and pacified. His ships did not arrive,\r\nhowever, and the help which he had requested did not come from Malaca,\r\nand yet it was necessary for him to go to Terrenate, as that was the\r\nprincipal purpose for which he had been sent. Considering this, and\r\nyet seeing that he had fewer men than he needed for it, and that the\r\ngreater part of the munitions and supplies which he had brought were\r\nspent, he determined to send word to the governor of the Filipinas of\r\nhis coming with that fleet, of what he had done in Amboino, that he\r\nwas to proceed to attack Terrenate, and that, because a part of his\r\nships had been scattered, and because he had stopped so many months\r\nfor those undertakings, he had fewer men than he wanted and was in need\r\nof some things, especially supplies. He requested the governor, since\r\nthis matter was so important and so to the service of his Majesty,\r\nand since so much had been spent on it from the royal treasury of the\r\ncrown of Portugal, to favor and help him, by sending him some supplies\r\nand munitions and some Castilians for the undertaking. He asked that\r\nall of this should reach Terrenate by January of six hundred and three,\r\nfor he would then be off that fort and the help would come to him very\r\nopportunely. This message and his letters for the governor and the\r\nAudiencia he sent to Manila from Amboino in a light vessel in charge\r\nof Father Andre Pereira of the Society of Jesus, and Captain Antonio\r\nFogoça, one of his own followers. They found Governor Don Pedro de\r\nAcuña in Manila, and presented the matter to him, making use of the\r\nAudiencia and of the orders, and making many boasts of the Portuguese\r\nfleet and the illustrious men who were in it, and of the valor and\r\nrenown of its general in whatever he undertook. They asserted at\r\nthe same time the success of the capture of Terrenate at that time,\r\nespecially if they received from Manila the succor and help for which\r\nthey had come, and which, in justice, should be given them, as it was\r\ngiven from the Filipinas whenever the king of Tidore and the chief\r\ncaptain of that fort requested it, and as his Majesty had ordered--and\r\nwith more good reason and foundation on such an occasion. [160]\r\n\r\nAlthough Don Pedro de Acuña, from the time of his appointment to\r\nthe government, had the intention and desire to make an expedition\r\nagainst Terrenate, and when he was in Mexico on his way, had treated\r\nof this matter with those there who had any information about Maluco,\r\nand sent Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus from Nueva\r\nEspañia to his Majesty's court--who had lived in Manila many years,\r\nand also in Maluco in the time of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmariñas--to\r\ntreat of the matter in his name with his Majesty; and although he was\r\nin hopes of making this expedition: nevertheless it seemed to him best,\r\nwithout declaring his own desires, to aid in what Andrea Furtado asked,\r\nand even more, not only on account of the importance of the matter,\r\nbut also because by thus helping, he would keep the general and his\r\nmessengers, in case they were unsuccessful, from excusing themselves\r\nby saying that they had asked for help and reënforcement from the\r\ngovernor of the Filipinas, and the latter had not given it, and so\r\nthat it might not be understood that he had failed to do so because\r\nhe himself was arranging for the expedition. Don Pedro de Acuñia\r\nconsulted about this matter with the Audiencia, which was of the\r\nopinion that the aforesaid reënforcement, and more besides, should\r\nbe sent to the Portuguese at the time for which it was asked. When\r\nthis was decided upon, they put it into execution, very much to the\r\nsatisfaction of Father Andrea Pereira and Captain Fogaça. At the end of\r\nthe year six hundred and two they were despatched from the Filipinas,\r\ntaking with them the ship \"Santa Potenciana\" and three large frigates,\r\nwith one hundred and fifty well armed Spanish soldiers, ten thousand\r\nfanégas of rice, one thousand five hundred earthen jars of palm wine,\r\ntwo hundred head of salt beef, twenty hogsheads of sardines, conserves\r\nand medicines, fifty quintals of powder, cannon-balls and bullets,\r\nand cordage and other supplies, the whole in charge of the captain\r\nand sargento-mayor, Joan Xuarez Gallinato--who had now returned from\r\nJolo and was in Pintados--with orders and instructions as to what he\r\nwas to do, namely, to take that help to Terrenate, to the Portuguese\r\nfleet which he would find there, and to place himself at the orders\r\nand command of its general. [161] Thither he made his voyage in a\r\nfortnight, and anchored in the port of Talangame, in the island of\r\nTerrenate, two leguas from the fort, where he found Andrea Furtado\r\nde Mendoça with his galleons at anchor, awaiting what was being sent\r\nfrom Manila. He and all his men were very much pleased with it.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March of this year six hundred and three, there\r\nentered Manila Bay a ship from Great China, in which the sentinels\r\nreported that three great mandarins were coming, with their insignia\r\nas such, on business in the service of their king. The governor gave\r\nthem permission to leave their ship and enter the city with their\r\nsuites. In very curious chairs of ivory and fine gilded woods, borne\r\non the shoulders of men, they went straight to the royal houses of\r\nthe Audiencia, where the governor was awaiting them, with a large\r\nsuite of captains and soldiers throughout the house and through the\r\nstreets where they passed. When they had reached the doors of the\r\nroyal houses they alighted from their chairs and entered on foot,\r\nleaving in the street the banners, plumes, lances and other very showy\r\ninsignia which they brought with them. The mandarins went into a large,\r\nfinely-decorated hall, where the governor received them standing,\r\nthey making many bows and compliments to him after their fashion, and\r\nhe replying to them after his. They told him through the interpreters\r\nthat their king had sent them, with a Chinaman whom they had with\r\nthem in chains, to see with their own eyes an island of gold, called\r\nCabit, which he had told their king was near Manila, and belonged to no\r\none. [162] They said that this man had asked for a quantity of ships,\r\nwhich he said he would bring back laden with gold, and if it were\r\nnot so that they could punish him with his life. So they had come\r\nto ascertain and tell their king what there was in the matter. The\r\ngovernor replied briefly, saying only that they were welcome, and\r\nappointed them quarters in two houses within the city which had been\r\nprepared for them, in which they and their men could lodge. He said\r\nthat the business would be discussed afterwards. Thereupon they left\r\nthe royal houses again, and at the doors mounted in their chairs on\r\nthe shoulders of their servants, who were dressed in red, and were\r\ncarried to their lodgings, where the governor ordered them to be\r\nsupplied fully with whatever they needed during the days of their stay.\r\n\r\nThe coming of these mandarins seemed suspicious, and their purpose\r\nto be different from what they said, because it seemed a fiction for\r\npeople, of so much understanding as the Chinese, to say that their\r\nking was sending them on this business. Among the Chinese themselves\r\nwho came to Manila at the same time in eight merchant ships, and\r\namong those who lived in the city, it was said that these mandarins\r\nwere coming to see the land and study its nature, because the king of\r\nChina wished to break relations with the Spaniards and send a large\r\nfleet, before the end of the year, with one hundred thousand men to\r\ntake the country.\r\n\r\nThe governor and the Audiencia thought that they ought to be very\r\ncareful in guarding the city, and that these mandarins should be well\r\ntreated, but that they should not go out of the city nor be allowed to\r\nadminister justice, as they were beginning to do among the Sangleys,\r\nat which the mandarins were somewhat angry. He asked them to treat\r\nof their business, and then to return to China quickly, and he warned\r\nthe Spaniards not to show that they understood or were suspicious of\r\nanything other than what the mandarins had said. The mandarins had\r\nanother interview with the governor, and he told them more clearly,\r\nmaking some joke of their coming, that he was astonished that their\r\nking should have believed what that Chinaman whom they had with them\r\nhad said, and even if it were true that there was so much gold in the\r\nFilipinas, that the Spaniards would not allow it to be carried away,\r\nsince the country belonged to his Majesty. The mandarins said that they\r\nunderstood very well what the governor had communicated to them, but\r\nthat their king had ordered them to come and that they must needs obey\r\nand bring him a reply, and that when they had performed their duty,\r\nthat was all, and they would return. The governor, to cut short the\r\nbusiness, sent the mandarins, with their servants and the prisoner,\r\nto Cabit, which is the port, two leguas from the city. There they were\r\nreceived with a great artillery salute, which was fired suddenly as\r\nthey landed, at which they were very frightened and fearful. When they\r\nhad landed, they asked the prisoner if that was the island of which\r\nhe had spoken to the king, and he replied that it was. They asked him\r\nwhere the gold was, and he replied that everything there was gold and\r\nthat he would make his statement good with the king. They asked him\r\nother questions and he always replied the same thing. Everything was\r\nwritten down in the presence of some Spanish captains who were there\r\nwith some confidential interpreters. The mandarins ordered a basketful\r\nof earth to be taken from the ground, to take to the king of China,\r\nand then, having eaten and rested, they returned to Manila the same\r\nday, with the prisoner. The interpreters said that the prisoner,\r\nwhen hard pressed by the mandarins to make suitable answers to their\r\nquestions, had said that what he had meant to tell the king of China\r\nwas that there was much gold and wealth in the hands of the natives\r\nand Spaniards of Manila, and that if they gave him a fleet with men,\r\nhe offered, as a man who had been in Luzon and knew the country, to\r\ncapture it and bring the ships back laden with gold and riches. This,\r\ntogether with what some Chinamen had said at the beginning, seemed very\r\nmuch to have more meaning than the mandarins had implied, especially\r\nto Don Fray Miguel de Benavides, archbishop-elect of Manila, who knew\r\nthe language. Thereupon the archbishop and other religious warned the\r\ngovernor and the city, publicly and privately, to look to its defense,\r\nbecause they felt sure of the coming of the Chinese fleet against it\r\nshortly. Then the governor dismissed the mandarins and embarked them\r\non their ship, with their prisoner, after giving them some pieces\r\nof silver and other things with which they were pleased. Although,\r\nin the opinion of the majority of those in the city, it seemed that\r\nit was beyond all reason that the Chinese should attack the country,\r\nthe governor began covertly to prepare ships and other things suitable\r\nfor defense, and made haste to complete extensive repairs which he\r\nhad begun to make on the fort of Sanctiago at the point of the river,\r\nand for the defense of the fort he built on the inside a wall of\r\ngreat strength, with its wings, facing toward the parade ground.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April of this year six hundred and three, on the\r\neve of Sts. Philip and James [Santiago] a fire started in a little\r\nfield house [casilla de zacate] used by some Indians and negroes of\r\nthe native hospital in the city, at three o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nand passed to other houses so quickly, with the force of the rather\r\nfresh wind, that it could not be stopped, and burned houses of wood\r\nand stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic--house and church--the\r\nroyal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without\r\nleaving a building standing among them. Fourteen people died in the\r\nfire, Spaniards, Indians, and negroes, and among them Licentiate Sanz,\r\ncanon of the cathedral. In all two hundred and sixty houses were\r\nburned, with much property which was in them, and it was understood\r\nthat the damage and loss amounted to more than one million [pesos].\r\n\r\nAfter Ocuña Lacasamanà, the Moro Malay, with the help of the mandarins\r\nof Camboja who sided with him, and of the stepmother of King Prauncar,\r\nhad killed and put an end to Bias Ruyz de Hernan Gonçales and Diego\r\nBelloso, and the Castilians, Portuguese, and Japanese on their side\r\nwho were in the kingdom, his boldness went so far that he even killed\r\nthe king himself, whereby the whole kingdom was divided into factions\r\nand suffered greater disturbances than it had ever known before. God\r\npermitted this for His just judgments, and because Prauncar did\r\nnot deserve to enjoy the good fortune which he had had in being\r\nplaced on his father's throne, since he lost it at the same time\r\nthat he did his life. Nor did Bias Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales and Diego\r\nBelloso, and their companions, deserve the fruit and labor of their\r\nexpeditions and victories, since they were converted into disastrous\r\nand cruel death at the time when they seemed most secure and certain,\r\nfor perchance their pretensions and claims were not so well adjusted\r\nto the obligations of conscience as they ought to have been. But God\r\ndid not wish the Moro Malay to remain unpunished.\r\n\r\nWhen this Malay thought that he was going to get the better part\r\nof the kingdom of Camboja, because he had killed the Castilians and\r\nPortuguese, their captains, and the legitimate and natural king himself\r\nwho favored them, he was more mistaken than he thought, because the\r\ndisorders and uprisings in the provinces gave opportunity for some\r\npowerful mandarins in the kingdom, who held and maintained the saner\r\ncourse, to join, and avenge the death of King Prauncar by force of\r\narms. So they turned against Ocuña Lacasamana and his Malays, and,\r\nmeeting them in battle on different occasions, conquered and routed\r\nthem, so that the Moro was forced to flee from Camboja, with the\r\nremaining remnant of his men, and pass to the kingdom of Champa,\r\nwhich bordered on it, with the purpose of disturbing it and making\r\nwar on the usurper who held it, and of seizing it all, or as much as\r\nhe could. This also did not turn out well for him, for, although he\r\nbrought war into Champa, and all the disturbances which it brings,\r\nand caused the usurper and his men a great deal of trouble, at last\r\nhe was routed and killed and came to pay wretchedly for his sins at\r\nthe usurper's hands.\r\n\r\nSeeing themselves rid of the Malay, but finding that the kingdom was\r\nstill disturbed, as he had left it, and without a male descendant\r\nin the line of Prauncar Langara, who died in Laos, the mandarins\r\nof Camboja turned their eyes toward a brother of his whom the\r\nking of Sian had captured and taken with him in the war which he\r\nhad made against Langara, and whom he held in the city of Odia, as\r\nthey thought that he had the best right to the kingdom of Camboja,\r\nby legitimate succession, and that it would be more easily pacified\r\nin his presence. They sent an embassy to Sian, asking him to come to\r\nreign, and asking the king of Sian, who held him captive, to allow\r\nhim to go. The king thought well of it, and, with certain provisions\r\nand conditions which he made with his prisoner, gave him his liberty\r\nand six thousand fighting men to serve and accompany him. With these\r\nhe came immediately to Camboja and was readily received in Sistor and\r\nother provinces, and placed on the throne, and from those provinces\r\nhe went on pacifying and reducing the more distant ones.\r\n\r\nThis new king of Camboja who, from being a captive of the king of Sian,\r\ncame to the throne by such strange events and varying chances--for\r\nGod held this good fortune in store for him, and holds still more of\r\ngreater worth, if he can carry on what he has begun--caused search\r\nto be made for Joan Diaz, a Castilian soldier, who survived from the\r\ncompany of Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonçales. He bade him go to Manila\r\nand, in his behalf, tell the governor that he was on the throne, and\r\nalso what had happened in regard to the death of the Spaniards and\r\nof his nephew Prauncar, in which he [the new king] was in no wise to\r\nblame. He said that he recognized the friendship which they--Langara,\r\nhis brother, and the latter's son--received from the Spaniards in the\r\ntime of their troubles; that he himself was well disposed to continue\r\nthis friendship and understanding; and he again asked the governor,\r\nif he were willing, to send him some religious and Castilians to reside\r\nat his court and to make Christians of those who wished to become so.\r\n\r\nWith this message and embassy, and many promises, Joan Diaz came\r\nto Manila, where he found Don Pedro de Acuña in the government,\r\nand treated of the matter with him. The governor thought it unwise\r\nto close the door to the preaching of the holy gospel in Camboja,\r\nwhich God had opened again in this way, and he agreed to do what the\r\nking asked. So, at the beginning of the year six hundred and three,\r\nhe sent a frigate to Camboja, with four religious of the Order of\r\nSt. Dominic with Fray Yñigo de Santa Maria, prior of Manila, at\r\ntheir head with five soldiers to accompany them, among them Joan\r\nDiaz himself. They were to give the king the reply to his message,\r\nin confirmation of the peace and friendship for which he asked, and,\r\naccording to the circumstances which they found there, the religious\r\nwere to stay in his court and advise what seemed best to them. This\r\nfrigate reached Camboja after a ten days' voyage with favoring winds,\r\nand the religious and the soldiers in their company ascended the river\r\nto Chordemuco, where the king received them with great satisfaction. He\r\nimmediately built them a church, and gave them rice for their support,\r\nand granted them liberty to preach and christianize. This seemed\r\nto the religious to be the work of Heaven, and a matter in which a\r\ngreat many workers could be employed. They sent immediate word of\r\ntheir good reception and condition to Manila in the same frigate,\r\nafter asking permission of the king that it might return. The king\r\ngranted it and gave them the necessary supplies for their voyage, and\r\nat the same time sent a servant of his with a present of ivory tusks,\r\nbenzoin, and other curious things for the governor, with a letter\r\nthanking him for what he was doing and asking for more religious and\r\nCastilians. Fray Yñigo de Santa Maria [163] with a companion embarked\r\non this frigate, in order to come to give a better report of what he\r\nhad found, but he sickened and died on the voyage. His companion and\r\nthose aboard the frigate reached Manila in May of six hundred and\r\nthree and gave an account of events in Camboja.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the same month of May, there came to Manila two ships\r\nfrom Nueva España, in command of Don Diego de Camudio, with the\r\nregular reënforcements for the Philipinas. It brought news that\r\nFray Diego de Soria, [164] of the Order of St. Dominic, bishop of\r\nCagayan, was in Mexico, and was bringing the bulls and pallium to\r\nthe archbishop-elect of Manila, and Fray Baltasar de Cobarrubias,\r\n[165] of the Order of St. Augustine, appointed bishop of Camarines\r\nby the death of Fray Francisco de Ortega. In the same ships came two\r\nauditors for the Audiencia of Manila, Licentiates Andres de Alcaraz,\r\nand Manuel de Madrid y Luna.\r\n\r\nThe captain and sargento-mayor, Joan Xuarez Gallinato, with the ship\r\n\"Santa Potenciana\" and the men whom he had taken in it to Maluco in aid\r\nof the Portuguese fleet which Andrea Furtado de Mendoça had brought\r\nto assault the fortress of Terrenate, found this fleet in the port\r\nof Talangame. As soon as this help arrived, Andrea Furtado landed\r\nhis men, Portuguese and Castilians, with six pieces of artillery,\r\nand marched with them along the shore, toward the fort, to plant the\r\nbattery. He took two days to reach the fort, passing through some\r\nnarrow places and gullies which the enemy had fortified. When he had\r\nreached the principal fort, he had all that he could do to plant the\r\nartillery, for the enemy sallied out frequently against the camp and\r\nhindered the work. Once they reached the very gate of the quarters,\r\nand would have done a great deal of damage had not the Castilians\r\nnearest the entrance stopped them and pressed the Moros so hard that,\r\nleaving some dead, they turned and fled and shut themselves up in the\r\nfort. At the same time five pieces were placed within cannon-shot\r\nof it. The enemy, who had sufficient men for their defense, with\r\na great deal of artillery and ammunition, did much damage in the\r\ncamp, whereas the pieces of the battery had no considerable effect,\r\nhaving but a short supply of powder and ammunition. Consequently what\r\nGallinato and his men had heard, when they joined the Portuguese fleet,\r\nof the scant supply and outfit which Andrea Furtado had brought for so\r\ngreat an enterprise, was seen and experienced very quickly. That they\r\nmight not all be killed, Andrea Furtado, having asked the opinion of\r\nall the officers of his camp and fleet, withdrew his pieces and camp\r\nto the port of Talangame. He embarked his men on his galleons and\r\nreturned to the forts and islands of Amboino and Vanda, where he had\r\nfirst been, taking for the support of the fleet the supplies brought\r\nhim by Gallinato, to whom he gave permission to return to Manila,\r\nwith the Castilians. The latter did so, in company with Ruy Gonçales\r\nde Sequeira, until recently chief captain of the fort of Tidore, who,\r\nwith his household and merchandise, left that fortress in another ship,\r\nand they reached Manila at the beginning of the month of July of this\r\nyear six hundred and three, bearing the following letter from Andrea\r\nFurtado de Mendoça to Governor Don Pedro de Acuña.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nA letter which General Andrea Furtado de Mendoça wrote to Don Pedro\r\nde Acuña from Terrenate on the twenty-fifth of March of the year one\r\nthousand six hundred and three.\r\n\r\nThere are no misfortunes in the world, however great they may be,\r\nfrom which some good may not be gained. Of all those through which\r\nI have passed in this undertaking, and they have been infinite, the\r\nresult has been that I have learned the zeal and courage which your\r\nLordship shows in the service of his Majesty, on account of which I\r\nenvy your Lordship and hold you as master, affirming that the thing\r\nwhich I would like most in this life would be for your Lordship to hold\r\nthe same opinion of me, and, as one that is very particularly your own,\r\nthat your Lordship should command me in what is for your service.\r\n\r\nThe help sent me by your Lordship came in time, by the favor of God,\r\nand was what gave this fleet to his Majesty and our lives to all of\r\nus alive today. By what happened in this expedition, his Majesty will\r\nunderstand how much he owes to your Lordship and how little to the\r\ncaptain of Malaca, for the latter was partly the cause that the service\r\nof his Majesty was not accomplished. When the ship sent me by your\r\nLordship arrived, this fleet was without any supplies because it had\r\nbeen two years since it had left Goa, and they had all been consumed\r\nand spent on the occasions which had presented themselves. Admitting\r\nthis in order that it may not be imagined that it was on my account\r\nthat the service of his Majesty was not carried out, I went on shore,\r\nwhich I gained, inflicting great losses on the enemy, and I placed\r\nmy last trenches a hundred paces from the enemy's fortification. I\r\nlanded five heavy pieces for battering, and in ten days of bombarding,\r\nknocked to pieces a large part of a bastion where all the enemy's\r\nforce was concentrated. In these days all the powder in the fleet\r\nwas spent, without a grain being left with which its artillery could\r\nbe loaded even once, and if I should happen to run across a Dutch\r\nsquadron, of which I have little doubt, I should be forced to fight\r\nwith them. This was the principal cause for which I raised the siege,\r\nwhen I had the enemy in great distress through hunger and also through\r\nhaving killed many of his captains and other men in the course of the\r\nfighting. From this your Lordship may judge of the state of suffering\r\nand grief in which I must be. God be praised for everything, since\r\nit is His will, and may He permit that His greatest enemies in these\r\nregions may become the vassals of his Majesty.\r\n\r\nI am leaving for Amboino to see if I can get help there, and if I\r\nfind sufficient, and if there is not elsewhere in the south anything\r\nin such urgent need that I must attend to it, I am going to return to\r\nthis undertaking, and I will inform your Lordship of it at length. If\r\nI do not find there the help which I expect, I shall go to Malaca to\r\nrefit, and from whatever place I am in, I shall always inform your\r\nLordship. I am writing to his Majesty, giving him a long account of the\r\naffairs of this enterprise, and stating that it cannot be accomplished\r\nor preserved in the future, unless it is done by the order of your\r\nLordship, and helped and increased by that government, since India is\r\nso far that it could not receive help from there within two years. In\r\nconformity with this, your Lordship should inform his Majesty, that\r\nhe may be undeceived in this regard about Maluco, and I trust to God\r\nthat I may be one of your Highness's soldiers.\r\n\r\nI do not know with what words I can praise or thank your Lordship for\r\nthe kind things which you have done for me. These were made plain\r\nto me by Antonio de Brito Fogaça, as well as by Tomas de Araux, my\r\nservant. These are things which can not be rewarded or paid except by\r\nrisking life, honor, and property on every occasion which offers itself\r\nin your service. If such an occasion should be presented to me, it will\r\nbe seen that I am not ungrateful for the favors which I have received;\r\nthe greatest of which, and the one which I esteem most highly, was\r\nthat, with this help, your Lordship sent me Joan Xuarez Gallinato,\r\nDon Tomas de Acuña, and the other captains and soldiers. If I were to\r\nmention to your Lordship the deserts of each and every one of these,\r\nI should never end.\r\n\r\nJoan Xuarez Gallinato is a person whom your Lordship should\r\nesteem highly on every occasion, because he deserves it all. In\r\nthis expedition and enterprise he conducted himself with so great\r\nsatisfaction, courage, and prudence, that it is very clear that\r\nhe was sent by your Lordship and had fought under the banners of\r\nso distinguished captains. Consequently, I shall be glad to know\r\nthat your Lordship has shown him many kindnesses, on account of his\r\nservices to his Majesty in these regions, and on my own account. The\r\nthing which pleased me most in this undertaking, and which is worthy\r\nof being remembered, is that, contrary to the proverb of the old\r\nPortuguese women, in the course of this war there was not one harsh\r\nword between the Spaniards and Portuguese, though they ate together at\r\none mess. But your Lordship may attribute this to your good fortune,\r\nand to the intelligence and experience of Joan Xuarez Gallinato.\r\n\r\nDon Tomas conducted himself in this war, not like a gentleman of\r\nhis age, but like an old soldier, full of experience. Your Lordship\r\nshould greatly esteem this relative, for I trust that your Lordship\r\nmay be a second father to him.\r\n\r\nThe sargento-mayor conducted himself in this war like an excellent\r\nsoldier, and he is a man whom your Lordship should regard favorably,\r\nfor I give my word that the Manilas do not contain a better soldier\r\nthan he, and I shall be greatly pleased if your Lordship honor him\r\nand show him very particular favors on my account. Captain Villagra\r\nfulfilled his duty well and Don Luys did the same. In short all the\r\nsoldiers, to a man, great and small, did likewise in this enterprise,\r\nso that for this reason I am under so great obligations to them that,\r\nif I were now before his Majesty, I would not leave his feet till I\r\nhad heaped them all with honors and favors since they also deserve\r\nthem. So for this reason I shall always be particularly glad if\r\nyour Lordship confers honors and favors on them all in general. May\r\nour Lord preserve your Lordship for many years, as I, your servant,\r\ndesire. From the port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate, on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of March, of the year one thousand six hundred and three.\r\n\r\nANDREA FURTADO DE MENDOÇA\r\n\r\n(To be concluded)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA\r\n\r\nSucesos de las Islas Filipinas, by Dr. Antonio de Morga.--The\r\ntranslation is made from the Harvard original. In conjunction with it\r\nhave been used the following editions: The Zaragoza reprint (Madrid,\r\n1887) a unique copy (No. 2658, Catálogo de la librería de P. Vindel)\r\nowned by Edward E. Ayer, of Chicago; the Rizal reprint (Paris, 1890);\r\nand Lord Stanley's translation (London, Hakluyt Society edition, 1868).\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A: EXPEDITION OF THOMAS CANDISH\r\n\r\nThomas Candish or Cavendish, was a native of \"Trimley in the country\r\nof Suffolke.\" His fleet, consisting of three vessels, \"The Desire,\"\r\nof 120 tons, \"The Content,\" of 60 tons, and \"Hugh Gallant,\" of 40 tons,\r\nleft Plymouth July 21, 1586, with one hundred and twenty-three men in\r\nall, and provisions for two years. Steering a general southwest course\r\nthey reached the Strait of Magellan January 6, 1587. In the strait they\r\nfound the melancholy remains of a Spanish colony started three years\r\nbefore--Twenty-three people out of the four hundred settlers, two of\r\nwhom were women. One named Hernando they took with them. This place\r\nthe Englishmen appropriately named Port Famine. Shortly after leaving\r\nthe strait they found at an Indian settlement, under the Spanish,\r\nsome \"guinie wheat, which is called Maiz.\" The first capture was\r\nMay 1--a boat of three hundred tons from Guaianel laden with timber\r\nand food. Prizes after that were thick and fast, and the vessels\r\nwere generally burned after being despoiled of valuables. On July 9,\r\nnear the coast of New Spain, a ship of one hundred and twenty tons was\r\ntaken, from one of the crew of which, Michael Sancius from Marseilles,\r\nthey first heard of \"the great shippe called The Santa Anna, vvhich\r\nvve aftervvard tooke comming from the Philippinas.\" After coasting\r\nalong New Spain and California committing various depredations,\r\namong them the defacing of the Spanish churches, and various other\r\npiratical deeds, they met on the fourth of November with the \"Santa\r\nAna.\" They pursued it for three or four hours and finally overtaking\r\nfought with and captured it. The fight is described as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoone we gat vp vnto them, giuing them the broad side\r\nwith our great ordnance, and a volee of small shot, and presently\r\nlaid the ship aboord, whereof the King of Spaine was owner, which was\r\nAdmirall of the South-sea, called the S. Anna, and thought to be seuen\r\nhundred tvnnes in burthen. Now as we were readie on their ships side\r\nto enter her, beeing not past fiftie or sixty men at the vttermost\r\nin our ship, we perceived that the Captain of the said ship had made\r\nfights fore and after, and laid their sailes close on their poope,\r\ntheir mid-ship, with their fore-castle, and hauing not one man to\r\nbe seene, stood close vnder their fights, with Lances, Iauelings,\r\nRapiers and Targets, and an innumerable sort of great stones, which\r\nthey threw ouer boord vpon our heads, and into our ship so fast,\r\nand beeing so many of them, that they put vs off the shippe againe,\r\nwith the losse of two of our men which were slaine, and with the\r\nhurting of foure or fiue. But for all this we new trimmed our sailes,\r\nand fitted euery man his furniture, and gaue them a fresh incounter\r\nwith our great Ordnance, and also with our small shot, raking them\r\nthorough and thorough, to the killing and maiming of many of their\r\nmen. Their Captaine still like a valiant man with his companie, stood\r\nvery stoutly vnto his close fights, not yeelding as yet. Our General\r\nincouraging his men afresh with the whole noyse of trumpets, gaue them\r\nthe third encounter with our great Ordnance, and all our small shot to\r\nthe great discomforting of our enemies, raking them through in diuerse\r\nplaces, killing and spoyling many. They beeing thus discomforted,\r\nand their shippe beeing in hazard of sinking by reason of the great\r\nshot which were made, whereof some were vnder water, within fiue or\r\nsixe houres fight, set out a flagge of truce, and parled for mercie,\r\ndesiring our Generall to saue their liues, and to take their goods,\r\nand that they would presently yeeld. Our Generall promised them\r\nmercy, and willed them to strike their sayles, and to hoyse out their\r\nboat, & to come aboord: which newes they were full glad to heare,\r\nand presently stroke their sailes, hoysed their boat out, and one of\r\ntheir chiefe marchants came aboord vnto our Generall: and falling downe\r\nvpon his knees, offered to haue kissed his feete, and craued mercie:\r\nthe Captaine and their Pilote, at their comming vsed the like duetie\r\nand reuerence as the former did. The Generall promised their liues and\r\ngood vsage. They declared what goods they had within boord, to wit,\r\nan hundreth and two and twenty thousand pezos of gold: and the rest\r\nof the riches that the ship was laden with, was in Silkes, Sattens,\r\nDamasks, with Muske and diuers other marchandize, and great store\r\nof all manner of victualls, with the choice of many conserues of all\r\nsorts for to eate, and of sundry sorts of very good wines. These things\r\nbeeing made knowne, they were commanded to stay aboord the Desire,\r\nand on the sixt day of Nouember following, we went into an harbour,\r\nwhich is called by the Spaniards, Aguada Segura, or Puerto Seguro.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the division of the booty, a mutiny broke out, especially in\r\nthe ship \"Content,\" but was quelled. The Spaniards, to the number\r\nof one hundred and ninety men and women, were set ashore. Ammunition\r\nand arms were left them, and the English departed: taking with them\r\nhowever from the Spanish boat two clever young Japanese, three boys\r\nborn in Manila, a Portuguese, and one Thomas de Ersola, a pilot from\r\nAcapulco. The \"Santa Ana\" was burned on the nineteenth of November,\r\nand the English turned toward home. That same night the \"Content\"\r\nvanished and was seen no more. January 3, 1588, the Ladrones were\r\nreached. They had the experiences with the natives that are so often\r\ndescribed by the Spaniards, iron being the usual article bartered\r\nby the English. The natives are described as \"of a tawny colour, and\r\nmaruellous fat, and bigger ordinarily of stature then the most part of\r\nour men in England, wearing their haire maruellous long: yet some of\r\nthem haue it made vp, and tyed with a knot on the Crowne and some with\r\ntwo knots, much like vnto their Images which we faw carued in wood,\r\nand standing in the head of their boats, like vnto the Images of the\r\ndeuill.\" January 14, they reached the Philippines at Cabo del Santo\r\nEspiritu, \"which is of very great bignesse and length .... and it is\r\nshort of the chiefest Island of the Philippinas called Manilla, about\r\nsixtie leagues. Manilla is vvel planted and inhabited with Spaniards,\r\nto the number of sixe or seuen hundred persons: vvhich dvvell in\r\na tovvne vnvvalled, which hath three or foure Blocke-houses, part\r\nmade of vvood, and part of stone, being indeed of no great strength:\r\nthey haue one or tvvo small Gallies belonging to the Tovvne. It is\r\na very rich place of Gold, and many other commodities; and they haue\r\nyeerely traffique from Alcapulco in Nueva Espanna, and also twenty or\r\nthirtie shippes from China, and from the Sanguelos, which bring them\r\nmany sorts of marchandize. They bring great store of gold vvith them,\r\nvvhich they traffique and exchange for siluer, and give vveight for\r\nvveight. These Sanguelos are men of maruellous capacity, in deuising\r\nand making all manner of things, especially in all handiecrafts\r\nand sciences: and euery one is so expert, perfect, and skilfull in\r\nhis facultie, as fevv or no Christians are able to go beyond them\r\nin that vvhich they take in hand. For drawing and imbroidering vpon\r\nSatten, Silke, or Lavvne, either beast, fovvle, fish, or vvorme, for\r\nliuelinesse and perfectnesse, both in Silke, Siluer, Gold, and Pearle,\r\nthey excell. Also the fourteenth day at night we entred the Straits\r\nbetween the Island of Luçon, and the Island of Camlaia.\" The natives\r\nimagining them Spaniards willingly traded their food with them. At\r\nan anchorage Thomas Ersola, the Spanish pilot, was hanged for trying\r\nto inform the Spanish of the English. The following on the customs\r\nof the inhabitants as seen at the island of Capul is interesting,\r\nand accords, with slight differences, with the Spanish records:\r\n\r\n\"We roade for the space of nine dayes, about this Island of Capul,\r\nwhere we had diuerse kinds of fresh victualls, with excellent fresh\r\nwater in euery bay, and great store of wood. The people of this\r\nIsland go almost all naked, and are tawny of colour. The men weare\r\nonely a stroope about their wastes, of some kind of linnen of their\r\nowne weauing, which is made of Plantan-leaues, and another stroope\r\ncomming from their backe vnder their twistes, Which couereth their\r\npriuy parts, and is made fast to their girdles at their nauels;\r\nwhich is this. Euery man and manchild among them, hath a nayle of\r\nTynne thrust quite through the head of his priuie part, being split\r\nin the lower ende, and riuetted, and on the head of the nayle is as\r\nit were a Crowne: which is driuen through their priuities when they\r\nbe yong, and the place groweth vp ag tine [sic], without any great\r\npaine to the child: and they take this nayle out and in as occasion\r\nserueth; and for the truth thereof, we our selues haue taken one of\r\nthese nayles from a Sonne of one of the Kings, which was of the age\r\nof tenne yeeres, who did weare the same in his priuy member. This\r\ncustome was granted at the request of the women of the Country,\r\nwho finding their men to be giuen to the fovvle sinne of Sodomie,\r\ndesired fome remedie against that mischiefe, and obtained this before\r\nnamed of the Magistrates. Moreouer all the males are circumcised,\r\nhauing the fore skinne of their flesh cut avvay. These people vvholly\r\nvvorshippe the Deuill, and oftentimes haue conference vvith him,\r\nvvhich appeareth vnto them in moft vgly and monstrous shape.\"\r\n\r\nIn this island Candish, or Cavendish, announced their nationality\r\nto the natives--whom he had made pay tribute in \"Hogges, Hennes,\r\nPotatoes, and Cocos\"--and their hostility to the Spaniards. The\r\nnatives promised \"both themselues and all the Islands thereabout,\r\nto ayde him, whensoeuer hee should come againe to ouercome the\r\nSpaniards.\" Their tribute money was returned to them in token of\r\nthe Englishmen's hostility to the Spaniards. January 24 the English\r\ncoasted along Luzón, and ran northwest between that island and Masbat.\r\n\r\n\"The eight and twentieth day, in the morning about seuen of the clocke,\r\nriding at an anchor betwixt two Islands, wee espyed a Frigat vnder\r\nher two Coarses, comming out betweene two other Islands, which (as wee\r\nimagined) came from Manilla, sayling close aboord the shore, along the\r\nmaine Island of Panama. Here wee rode at anchor all that night, and\r\nperceiued that certaine Spaniards (which came from Manilla to Ragaun,\r\nto fetch a new shippe of the Kings, there builded) had disperfed their\r\nBand into two or three parts, and kept great Watch in seuerall steedes,\r\nwith Fires, and shooting off their Pieces. This Island hath much plaine\r\nGround in it, in many places, and many faire and straight Trees doe\r\ngrow vpon it, fit for to make excellent good Masts for all sorts of\r\nshippes. There are also Mynes of very fine Gold in it, which are in the\r\ncustodie of the Indians. And to the South-ward of this place, there\r\nis another very great Island, which is not subdued by the Spaniards,\r\nnor any other Nation. The people which inhabit it, are all Negros,\r\nand the Island is called the Island of Negros; and is almost as bigge\r\nas England, standing in nine degrees: The most part of it seemeth to\r\nbe very lowe Land, and by all likelyhood is very fruitfull.\r\n\r\n\"The nine and twentieth day of January, about six of the clocke in the\r\nmorning wee set sayle, sending our Boat before, vntill it was two of\r\nthe clocke in the afternoone, passing all this time as it were through\r\na Strait, betwixt the laid two Islands of Panama, and the Island of\r\nNegros; and about sixteene Leagues off, wee espyed a faire opening,\r\ntrending South-west and by South: at which time our Boat came aboord,\r\nand our Generall sent commendations to the Spanish Captaine, which\r\nwee came from the Euening before, by a Spaniard which wee had taken,\r\nand willed him to provide a good store of Gold; for hee meant for to\r\nsee him with his company at Manilla within few yeeres; and that hee\r\ndid but want a bigger Boat to haue landed his men; or else hee would\r\nhaue seene him then; and so caused him to be let on shore.\"\r\n\r\nThence the expedition passed through the Moluccas. At one of the\r\nislands where they reprovisioned two Portuguese came to inquire of\r\n\"Don Antonio their King, then in England.\" These Portuguese declared\r\n\"that if their King Don Antonio, would come vnto them, they would\r\nwarrant him to haue all the Malucos at commandment, besides China,\r\nSangles, and the Isles of the Philippinas, and that he might be assured\r\nto have all the Indians on his side that are in the countrey.\" The\r\nsixteenth of May the Cape of Good Hope was sighted. August 23,\r\nthe Azores Islands hove in sight, and on September 9, they put into\r\nPlymouth. A letter from the commander contains the following:\r\n\r\n\"The matter of most profit vnto me, was a great ship of the Kings\r\nvvhich I tooke at California, vvhich ship came from the Philippinas,\r\nbeeing one of the richest of merchandize that euer passed those\r\nSeas, as the Kings Register and marchants accounts did shew: for\r\nit did amount in value to * in Mexico to be sold. Which goods (for\r\nthat my Ships vvere not able to containe the least part of them)\r\nI vvas inforced to set on fire. From the Cape of California, being\r\nthe vthermost part of all Nueua Espanna, I nauigated to the Islands\r\nof the Philippinas, hard vpon the Coast of China; of which Countrey\r\nI haue brought such intelligence as hath not been heard of in these\r\nparts. The statlinesse and riches of vvhich Countrey I feare to make\r\nreport of, least I should not be credited: for if I had not knovvn\r\nsufficiently the incomparable vvealth of that Countrey, I should\r\nhaue beene as incredulous thereof, as others vvill be rhat [sic]\r\nhaue not had the like experience.\" [166]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B: EARLY YEARS OF THE DUTCH IN THE EAST INDIES\r\n\r\nThe voyages of the Dutch into the East Indies had important results for\r\nboth Spain and Portugal. While they concerned themselves principally\r\nwith Java and the islands of the Moluccas, they made incursions among\r\nthe Philippines, where they were a constant menace for many years. The\r\nfirst two expeditions--that of Houtman, June 11, 1596-August 14,\r\n1597; and that of van Neck and van Warwyck, May 1, 1598-May 30,\r\n1600--did little but establish the custom and make beginnings in\r\nthe East India trade. The first was concerned mainly with Java, but\r\nthe second entered (with four of its eight vessels) the Moluccas,\r\nand brought back a load of cloves. These two expeditions also marked\r\nthe beginning of troubles with the Portuguese and natives. They were\r\nboth by way of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE OF OLIVER VAN NOORDT\r\n\r\nThe first voyage of great importance was that of Oliver van\r\nNoordt. In 1598 a commercial company contracted with him to conduct\r\nfive vessels through the Strait of Magellan for traffic on South\r\nAmerican coasts. This fleet sailed on September 13, 1598, going\r\nfirst to Plymouth, England, where an English pilot, who had been with\r\nCandish on his expedition, was engaged. After various fortunes along\r\nthe eastern South American coasts, during which about one hundred\r\nmen were lost, the fleet entered the Strait of Magellan November 5,\r\n1599. Contentions between van Noordt and his vice-admiral resulted\r\nin the latter's being marooned, and the elevation to his place of\r\nCaptain Pierre de Lint, while Lambert Biesman was made captain of\r\nthe \"Concordia.\" The vice-admiral and his ship were lost on March 14,\r\n1600, which with other losses, reduced the fleet to but two vessels. On\r\ndebouching from the strait the fleet cruised along the Chilean coast,\r\nalternately trading and committing depredations, and seizing prizes,\r\nand finally determined to go to the Philippines by way of the\r\nLadrones. On September 15, the latter islands were sighted. There\r\nthey met the same experience as the Spaniards from the thievishness\r\nof the natives. \"These people, both men and women, seem amphibious,\r\nand to be able to live on water as well as on the land, so well do\r\nthey swim and dive. Five pieces of iron were thrown into the sea to\r\nthem for the pleasure of seeing them exercise themselves. One of them\r\nwas skilful enough to get all five of them, and in so short a time\r\nthat one can regard it as marvelous.... Their canoes are so well\r\nmade ... and are fifteen or twenty feet long. They are quite roomy\r\nand good sailers. They do not turn about to tack, but place the helm\r\nin what was the bow, and leave the sail, which is made of reed mats\r\nand resembles a mizzen-sail, in its same position without changing\r\nit.\" Thence the route to the Philippines was continued. \"They are\r\ncalled also the Manillas, from the name of the chief port, and the\r\ncity built by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\"Some call them the islands of Luçon, because their chief\r\nisland is so named. It is said to be quite one hundred leagues in\r\ncircumference. There is located the city of Manille or Manilhe, the\r\ncapital of all these islands. They were formerly part of the crown\r\nof China, which abandoned them for some slight pretext. After that\r\ntheir laws and civilization were so poorly observed that they seemed\r\ndeadened when the Spaniards landed there. In fact, the inhabitants\r\nthere lived like beasts. Each one enslaved his neighbor, if he could,\r\nand their chief occupation was mutual oppression.\r\n\r\n\"Such a nature gave the Spaniards great facility in subduing them,\r\nwhich was rendered greater, since these people were simple and very\r\nstupid. As soon as one mentioned baptism to them, they ran to get it\r\nin droves, and became Christians to the extent desired. However the\r\nIlocos and others, too, who are called Pintados did not cease to give\r\ntrouble to their new masters.\r\n\r\n\"All these islands are densely populated and produce abundance of rice\r\nand wine made from nypa. Deer, buffaloes, bulls, cows, swine, goats,\r\nand other live-stock are found, although formerly they had none. But\r\nnow the care exercised by the Spaniards has made them so abundant,\r\nthat they yield in no way to Nouvelle Espagne.\r\n\r\n\"There are also many civet-cats, and all sorts of fruit as in\r\nChina. They yield considerable quantities of honey and wax. They\r\neven have gold, but although the islanders pay their tribute to the\r\nSpaniards in gold, the latter have not as yet--that is in the year\r\n1600--been able to ascertain where they get it, notwithstanding their\r\nefforts. They are commencing to sow wheat there. Flour was formerly\r\nbrought from Japon. The islands also supplied quantities of ebony\r\nand bamboo.\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese engage extensively in trade there. They take all kinds\r\nof merchandise there from China, namely, silks, cottons, china-ware,\r\ngunpowder, sulphur, iron, steel, quicksilver, copper, flour, walnuts,\r\nchestnuts, biscuits, dates, all sorts of stuffs, writing-desks,\r\nand other curiosities.\r\n\r\n\"The Spaniards load all this merchandise in Manila and export it\r\nto Nouvelle Espagne, whence more than one and one-half millions of\r\nsilver in money and in bars is taken annually to the Philippines. This\r\nsilver is exchanged for gold, giving four livres of silver for one\r\nof gold. But this traffic is not extensive, since there is enough\r\ngold in Pérou and Chili. They prefer to traffic with the Chinese,\r\nfor their returns reach one thousand per cent.\r\n\r\n\"The city of Manille is located in fourteen degrees of north\r\nlatitude. There is situated the residence of the Spanish governor,\r\nwho rules all the islands. The archbishop also lives there. He has\r\nsupreme authority in the ecclesiastical affairs of all the same\r\nislands, where there are also three bishops suffragan to himself.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 14, 1600, the Dutch sighted the cape of Espiritu\r\nSanto, whence they steered toward Manila. On the sixteenth\r\ntheir first encounter with the Spanish in the islands occurred,\r\nbut the Dutch reassured the latter by flying a Spanish pennant,\r\nand declaring themselves to be French commissioned by the Spanish\r\nmonarch. Consequently they were allowed to buy provisions freely,\r\nin return for which the natives demanded money.\r\n\r\n\"The majority of these Indians were naked. Some wore a cloth\r\ngarment, while some were even clad like Spaniards. The chiefs, who\r\nbelong to the former race of commanders of the country, and who yet\r\nremember that fact, have their skin cut or pricked very skilfully\r\nand singularly. These cuts or pricks have been made with iron and\r\nnever fade.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this is a wretched race, who have no weapons, so that the\r\nSpaniards tyrannize over them at will. They make them pay a tribute\r\nof three reals [sic], that is, a trifle less than three Dutch florins,\r\nper head, all men or women above twenty years.\r\n\r\n\"There are very few Spaniards in each district. They have a priest,\r\nwhom the inhabitants of the place revere greatly, so much so that\r\nonly lack of priests prevents them from holding all these islands\r\nin servitude; for even in places where there are neither priests nor\r\nSpaniards they have made the people pay tribute.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards at last became suspicious of the strangers and\r\ndemanded to see their commission, upon which the one given by the\r\nprince of Orange was produced, whereat great consternation reigned,\r\nand the Dutch were forbidden more provisions. The latter continuing\r\ntheir course entered the Manila strait on October 24, anchoring near\r\nCapul. On landing near here, one of the crew, Jean Caleway [i.e., John\r\nCalleway], an Englishman, and a musician, was somehow left behind,\r\nand it was conjectured that the natives had seized him. November 1,\r\nthe vessels left Capul for Manila, sailing among the various islands,\r\nand committing some depredations on Spanish, native, and Chinese\r\nvessels. From a Chinese pilot, van Noordt gained certain information\r\nconcerning Manila.\r\n\r\n\"The houses of the city of Manila are built close together. The city is\r\nsurrounded by a rampart supported by a wall. More than fifteen thousand\r\nChinese live outside its walls. They engage in their business together,\r\nand are given to various industries. In addition more than four hundred\r\nvessels go there annually from China, from the city and province of\r\nChincheo, laden with silks and all sorts of merchandise. They take back\r\nsilver money in return. They come at a certain fixed time, namely,\r\nafter the month of December or between Christmas and Easter. At the\r\nbeginning of this present month of November ... two Japanese vessels\r\nalso generally sail to Manila, laden with iron, flour, bacon, and\r\nother food....\r\n\r\n\"The walls of the city of Manila and the houses are built of stone, in\r\nthe modern fashion. It is so large and extensive that the Spaniards\r\nhave had a second wall built inside the city of less size than\r\nthe first, within which to retire in case of need.... It was made\r\nespecially in consideration of the Japanese, of whom the Spaniards\r\nare very suspicious.\r\n\r\n\"The governor of all the islands, who resembles a viceroy, lives in\r\nManille, as does also the archbishop. Besides the cathedral there are\r\nseveral other beautiful churches. All the inhabitants of these islands\r\nare either Christians or pagans. As for the Moros or Mahometans,\r\nthey have all been exterminated.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dutch continued their depredations, and sent a letter by an\r\nIndian to the governor, notifying him that they were going to visit\r\nhim. Biesman was sent on a scouting expedition, from which he finally\r\nreturned, after having been considered lost by some of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n\"The island of Manille, called Luçon by its inhabitants, is larger\r\nthan England and Scotland together. [167] There are other various\r\nislands about it, also very large.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a Japanese vessel some provisions were obtained, and the vessel\r\nwas allowed to continue its course to Manila. The depredations of\r\nthe Dutch were called to a sudden halt by the two Spanish vessels\r\nsent out under Dr. Morga on the fourteenth of December, 1600, when\r\nensued the fight described in Morga. [168] Van Noordt inspired his\r\nmen with new courage by threatening to blow up the vessel unless they\r\nfought more bravely. The Dutch found \"a little silver box containing\r\nlittle tickets filled with prayers and devotions to various saints,\r\nto obtain their protection in times of peril,\" on the dead body of a\r\nSpaniard. \"The two Spanish vessels had about five hundred men, both\r\nSpaniards and Indians, and ten pieces of cannon.\" The Dutch flagship\r\nfinally returned to Holland by way of Borneo, and Cape of Good Hope,\r\nreaching Rotterdam August 26, 1601. [169]\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nEtienne van der Hagen's expedition (April 6, 1599--July 12, 1601)\r\nreached the island of Amboina, where they besieged the Portuguese\r\nfort there for two months, but were unable to take it. They made an\r\nalliance with the natives before leaving against the Portuguese. The\r\nDutch fleet consisted of three vessels, and was sent out by the Dutch\r\nEast India Company for trading purposes.\r\n\r\nThe first expedition of Paul van Caerden (the Blancardo of the Spanish\r\naccounts) occupied December 21, 1599--October 11, 1601, and was sent\r\nout by the Nouvelle Compagnie des Brabançons. The fleet--four vessels\r\nin all--left Holland in charge of Admiral Pierre Both. In their\r\ncompany sailed four vessels of the old company, but they separated\r\nalmost immediately. They all went by way of the Cape of Good Hope. At\r\nBantam in Java two vessels of the four were sent, under command of van\r\nCaerden, to trade for pepper. The two ships coasted the shore of the\r\nisland of Sumatra, stopping at various places, without much success,\r\non account of the tricks of the natives in their trade, until they\r\nreached Achem in the northern part of the island. There they had\r\ntrouble with the natives which was instigated by a Portuguese priest,\r\nand after seizing some pepper, which act they justified, returned\r\nto Bantam in Java, where their cargo was completed. Van Caerden lost\r\ntwenty-seven men on this voyage, but brought back ten others who had\r\nbeen held prisoners at Achem.\r\n\r\nThe second voyage of van Neck, or Nek (June 28, 1600--July 15, 1604),\r\nfollowed, as the preceding expedition, the African route to Bantam,\r\nwhere it met two Dutch vessels of the new trading company. The fleet of\r\nsix vessels had separated by common consent, October 10, 1600, in order\r\nto facilitate their trade. Van Neck in the vessels with him, skirted\r\nCelebes, and went to Ternate, where he was cordially received by the\r\nnatives. There the usual troubles with the Portuguese began, which\r\nended in an indecisive naval battle. Shortly after, the Dutch left for\r\nChina, leaving six men to watch their interests among the natives. \"On\r\nthe nineteenth [of August] they anchored near the island of Coyo,\r\none of the Philippines. There they sent a small boat ashore. Its crew\r\nlearned that the inhabitants were savages, who paid tribute to the\r\nSpaniards. On the twenty-second they anchored near another large island\r\nof the Philippines, whose name cannot be found on the maps. It was\r\ncalled Langhairs-eiland, or Longhair Island, because its inhabitants\r\nwore their hair long, and hanging below the shoulders.\" September 20\r\nthey reached the Chinese coast, and on the twenty-seventh sighted \"a\r\nlarge city, built almost like Spanish cities,\" which they found to be\r\nMacao. There unfortunate encounters with the Portuguese lost the Dutch\r\nsome men; and failing in their efforts there, they went to Patane,\r\nwhere they traded some pepper. Thence the return voyage to Holland by\r\nway of the Cape of Good Hope was made. The other three vessels of his\r\nfleet arrived six weeks later. As consorts to van Neck's six vessels\r\ntwo other vessels had left Holland on the same date, also sent by\r\nthe new trading company. After several mutinies they reached Sumatra,\r\nwhence after troubles with the king of Achem, the two vessels left,\r\nleaving twelve of their men prisoners. The efforts of the latter to\r\nescape were fruitless and even the efforts (in 1602) of one of the\r\nvessels of Admiral Heemskerk, commander of a Dutch trading fleet,\r\nwere unable to rescue the prisoners.\r\n\r\nApril 5, 1601, a Dutch fleet of five vessels, under Wolphart Harmansan,\r\nset out with another fleet under Jaques van Heemskerk. On May 8, the\r\ntwo fleets separated, the former reaching the Bantam channel December\r\n26, 1601. Several naval encounters with the Portuguese fleet under\r\nAndrea Furtado de Mendoza resulted in partial victory for the Dutch,\r\nwho, after refitting at Bantam, took their course through the Moluccas,\r\nand then returned to Bantam and Holland, reaching that country,\r\nApril 4, 1603.\r\n\r\nGeorges Spilberg left Holland May 5, 1601, with three vessels. Rounding\r\nthe cape, he cruised along until reaching Ceylon, whence he went\r\nto Sumatra in September of 1602. At Sumatra he joined some English\r\nvessels, and all remained together, and opposed the Portuguese. April\r\n3, 1603, the Dutch and English left Sumatra and went to Java. At Bantam\r\nthey were joined by Admiral Wybrant Waarwyk with nine vessels. On June\r\n30, Admiral Heemskerk anchored at the same place with a Portuguese\r\nprize. After effecting their trade, the vessels returned to Holland,\r\nand Spilberg reached that country May 24, 1604.\r\n\r\nCorneille de Veen, in command of nine vessels, sailed from Holland\r\nJune 17, 1602, and was joined at sea by three others. April 15, 1603,\r\nSumatra was sighted, and the fleet anchored at Bantam in Java on the\r\ntwenty-ninth. Thence part of the fleet sailed for China. The fleet\r\ncaptured near Macao a Portuguese vessel richly laden. They also\r\nfought with a Siamese vessel, mistaking it for an enemy. Leaving\r\nBantam finally on their homeward trip, on January 27, 1604, they\r\nreached Holland the thirtieth of August.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under Wybrandt van Waarwyk marked a new progression\r\nin Dutch trading in Eastern seas. His expedition established\r\nBantam in Java more fully as the chief Dutch trading-post and\r\nbase of supplies. The number of vessels at his command (fifteen)\r\nenabled him to despatch them in different directions to pursue their\r\ntrade. The hostility to, and competition with, the Portuguese became\r\nmore marked, and the entrance into India (through Ceylon), Siam,\r\nand China, more pronounced. This expedition left Holland July 17,\r\n1602, being joined on the nineteenth by other vessels. Near the\r\nCape of Good Hope three vessels separated with orders to proceed\r\ndirectly to Achem in Sumatra. At that place they met three vessels,\r\nwhich had left Holland May 30, 1602, and whose commander Sebald de\r\nWeert received commission from Waarwyk as vice-admiral of the six\r\nvessels. After negotiations at Achem, the six vessels established\r\nrelations and promised assistance against the Portuguese, in Ceylon,\r\nbut they almost ended by the massacre of the vice-admiral and a number\r\nof his men. Engagements with the Portuguese through these seas,\r\nand more or less successful attempts at trading and establishing\r\nthemselves marked the progress of these vessels, until the return of\r\nthree of them to Holland in the latter part of 1604. The main body of\r\nthe fleet had experiences about similar to the above vessels, singly\r\nand in company, cruising through the East Indian seas, trading for\r\npepper, cinnamon, silks, and other products. The Moluccas and the\r\nPhilippines were generally given a wide berth, the Dutch seeking to\r\nestablish themselves fully on portions of the mainland and in Sumatra\r\nand Java. François Wittert, who was later commander of a fleet, was\r\nmade chief commissary at Bantam and given detailed instructions. The\r\nadmiral finally reached Holland June 4, 1607, with several vessels.\r\n\r\nThe expedition in charge of Etienne van der Hagen (or Haagen), that\r\nset out from Holland late in 1603 and early in 1604, had also decisive\r\nresults that more completely established the Dutch power in the East\r\nIndies. This expedition was destined to come more intimately in contact\r\nwith the Portuguese and Spaniards than any former expedition. From\r\nthis time and even before, the Dutch expeditions overlapped, and\r\nDutch vessels in the Eastern seas were by no means rare. This fleet\r\n(the second voyage of van der Hagen) comprised twelve vessels and\r\ntwelve hundred men. Its course was by way of Goa, Calicut, Cochin,\r\nand Ceylon, to Sumatra and Java, reaching the post at Bantam December\r\n31, 1604. There, shortly after, some English vessels were met. On\r\nJanuary 17, 1605, the principal vessels of the fleet left for the\r\nMoluccas. February 21, they anchored at Amboina, where they were about\r\nto storm the Portuguese fort, when the commander capitulated. \"After\r\nseveral conferences between the Portuguese commander's deputies\r\nand the admiral, it was resolved that all the unmarried Portuguese\r\nshould retire, and that those married could be free to remain, if\r\nthey took the oath of allegiance to the States-general and to Prince\r\nMaurice. Each one was allowed to take his gun or musket, but all\r\nthe cannon, ammunition, and arms of the king were to remain in the\r\nfort.\" The admiral and fifty men went to the captured fort, where\r\nthey ran up the Dutch colors. The fort and island had contained six\r\nhundred Portuguese. Forty-six Portuguese families remained and took\r\nthe oath. \"This victory was considerable, not only because of its\r\nslight cost, no blood having been shed, but because this place and\r\nthis island were of great importance.\" Thence five Dutch vessels went\r\nto Tidore, where the Portuguese lost two vessels in a sea fight. Then\r\nthe Portuguese fort was attacked, which was taken May 19, 1605, with\r\na loss of two Dutchmen and seventy-three Portuguese. The Portuguese,\r\nfive hundred in number, took the boats offered them and set out for\r\nthe Philippines. \"By this last victory, the Portuguese were driven\r\nfrom all the Moluccas, and had nothing more there, except a small\r\nfort in the island of Soler, near Timer.\" The conquered fort was\r\ndestroyed. Meanwhile other vessels of the fleet cruised about Sumatra,\r\nJava, Malacca, and neighboring places, trading and seeking to check\r\nthe Portuguese. Shortly after June of 1607, the Spaniards, two hundred\r\nand fifty in number, attacked one of the Dutch and Ternatan forts,\r\nbut were repulsed. On the desertion of the Tidore fort by the Dutch,\r\nseven hundred Spaniards returned to it. Thus the Dutch continued to\r\nstrengthen their hold throughout the Indies.\r\n\r\nThe expedition under command of Admiral Corneille Matelief (1605-1608)\r\nwas remarkable chiefly for its siege of Malacca, and later its\r\nmanipulations in the Moluccas and in China. The fleet was composed of\r\neleven vessels and one thousand three hundred and fifty-seven men,\r\nand cost 1,952,282 livres. Great trouble was experienced by the\r\nadmiral in the intoxication and excesses of his men, which led to\r\ninsubordination, during the entire course of the expedition. Also in\r\nall parts he met a great unwillingness among the natives for work and\r\nthe coming to definite conclusions, the latter exercising duplicity\r\nand at times treachery in their dealings with the Dutch. On March\r\n22, 1606, the fleet sighted Sumatra, after hearing of the successes\r\nin Amboina and Tidore. Going to the mainland they made agreements\r\nor treaties with the king of Johore, clause ten of which reads:\r\n\"Neither of the two parties shall make peace with the king of Spain,\r\nwithout the consent of the other.\" The succeeding siege of Malacca\r\nresulted in failure, and on August 24, 1606, the Dutch retired after\r\nlosing two of their ships. The Portuguese were in charge of Andrea\r\nFurtado de Mendoza. On the return of the Dutch to Sumatra and Java,\r\nthey met the great Portuguese fleet consisting of eighteen galleons,\r\nfour galleys, one caravel, and twenty-three fustas, with over three\r\nthousand men--the largest fleet ever seen in the Indias--and in\r\nthe combat captured and destroyed four galleons, although with\r\nsome considerable loss to themselves. The Portuguese prisoners\r\ntaken formed lengthy material for debates between the Portuguese\r\nand Dutch. On December 6, 1606, the admiral determined to go to the\r\nMoluccas with six vessels, and to send the others to Achem to load\r\ncargo for Holland. Reaching those islands after anchoring at Bantam,\r\nthe Dutch negotiated with the natives for their aid against the\r\nSpaniards garrisoned in Ternate and Tidore. At Amboina, the admiral\r\n\"learned that the soldiers of the garrison were living there in great\r\ndebauchery, and that they became intoxicated, and nearly every man had\r\nhis concubine. On that account the inhabitants were greatly shocked\r\nand were losing all their affection for the Dutch. They said that the\r\nPortuguese married women among them, by which the two nations were\r\nunited. But since there were no marriages with the Dutch, the two races\r\ncould not be bound by affection.\" Besides the natives wished settlers\r\nand not new men continually, whom they did not know. In consequence\r\nthe Dutch were permitted to marry the native women. Skirmishes with\r\nthe Spaniards resulted in little gain for the Dutch, and finally the\r\nfleet sailed for China, after passing among a few of the Philippines,\r\nwhere they entered into various relations and had various adventures,\r\ntrying ever to establish a fixed trade. Thence the vessels went in\r\ndifferent directions and on different missions toward the Dutch base\r\nat Bantam. At Bantam Admiral Paul van Caerden anchored on January 5,\r\n1608, to whom Matelief communicated the necessity of first attending\r\nto Molucca affairs, giving him also information and advice concerning\r\nthose islands and the Dutch and Spaniards there. Shortly after Admiral\r\nMatelief returned to Holland, where he anchored on September 2,\r\n1608. Admiral Matelief drew up while on this expedition a good résumé\r\nof Dutch aspirations in the East Indies that shows the compelling\r\nmotive in their expeditions thither. This memorial is as follows.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nMemoir by Admiral C. Matelief, on the subject of the condition and\r\nthe commerce of the Indies\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the condition of our country, and the wars that afflict\r\nit, on the part of an enemy so powerful as Albert of Austria, who\r\nis sustained by the house of Austria, and by his own house of Spain,\r\nit seems to me that one cannot be more assured of the prosperity of\r\naffairs in the Indias, than by leaving them solely in the hands of\r\nthe directors [of the trading company].\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese are our adversaries. More than a\r\ncentury ago they began to establish themselves there. They have gained\r\nan entrance into several countries, where they have fortresses, many\r\nmen, and an established government. Consequently they are enabled to\r\nattend to their business with greater certainty and by more convenient\r\nmethods than we, for we have to bring men from Holland, who become\r\nweakened by the fatigues of the voyage, while the subjects of the\r\nPortuguese, who live in the country, are fresh and full of health.\r\n\r\nFor, although the Portuguese have an insufficient number of men in\r\nthe Indias, to attend to all matters that arise, and at the same\r\ntime defend themselves against our nation, they can send men there\r\nmuch easier than we. Vessels from Portugal are obliged to go only as\r\nfar as Goa, where their men disembark and rest. Then they form their\r\nfleets from them; and the other Spaniards who come from the Manilles\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we would also establish ourselves advantageously and solidly\r\nin the Indias, we must necessarily have some station, where we may\r\nbe received and free, on our arrival from Holland. This would be the\r\nmeans of great profits. Refreshments could be found there ready for the\r\ncrews and for the vessels. That would increase our reputation among the\r\nIndian princes, who as yet have not dared repose entire confidence in\r\nus. The natives are sufficiently convinced that the Dutch are a good\r\nrace, and more gentle and tractable than the Spaniards. \"But,\" they\r\nsay, \"what good does that do us? The Dutch come here in passing, and\r\nonly while on their journey. As soon as their vessels are laden, they\r\nreturn. After that we are abandoned to the Spaniards and Portuguese,\r\nagainst whom we are powerless to defend ourselves. They come to pounce\r\nupon us, because we have traded with the Dutch, their enemies. On the\r\nother hand, if we attach ourselves to the Spanish, they, at least,\r\nprotect us in our needs. On the contrary, although the Dutch should\r\ncome with forces sufficient to protect us, we fear nothing from\r\nthem; they do not treat us as enemies. Even though we trade with the\r\nPortuguese, the Dutch allow us to live quietly, and we have only to\r\nbe careful of those who molest us. Consequently our best plan is to\r\nfavor the Portuguese, lest they annihilate us.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the reflections of all the Indians. Besides the Portuguese do\r\ntheir best to persuade them that we have no forces, that we are but\r\na rabble, who scarcely have fixed habitations in our own country,\r\nand quite far from being able to make lasting settlements in the\r\nIndias. As for them, they are established there with men who wish to\r\nlive there. Therefore it is necessary for us to seek means by which\r\nto gain the Indians, and make them understand that we have forces,\r\nand wish also to become established among them. If not, one must\r\nrecognize that our affairs will prosper ill.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of the Indias consists chiefly: 1. In pepper, which\r\nis loaded at Bantam, Jahor, Patane, Queda, and Achin; 2. in cloves,\r\nwhich are loaded at Amboina and the Moluccas; 3. in nutmeg and mace,\r\nor the rind of the nutmeg, which are loaded at Banda; 4. in the\r\ncommerce of Cambaie; 5. in the commerce of the Coromandel coast;\r\n6. in the commerce of both the Chinese and Japanese coasts.\r\n\r\nIf the commerce of each of these is not managed by one nation, whether\r\nthe Portuguese or others, it will happen that one will destroy the\r\nother. It will cause the price of merchandise in the Indias to advance,\r\nand a low price will be paid for them in Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, in regard to pepper, it is impossible for us to get the\r\ncommerce all to ourselves; for, besides the Portuguese, the English\r\nhave also undertaken the navigation to Bantam. They have their\r\ntrading-posts and houses, and are trading there peacefully, while we\r\nare at war against the Portuguese. We defend Bantam and the English\r\ntogether, while they enjoy there the profits that cost them neither\r\ndefenses, blood, nor any annoyance.\r\n\r\n[The king of Bantam is too young to negotiate with, and too much\r\nmoney would be spent uselessly. For the natives throughout the Indies\r\nwould not hesitate to violate any treaty in any peril or to their\r\nown profit.]\r\n\r\nBesides we are at peace with the English, and it would be unjust to\r\ntry to find means to exclude them from a commerce which they have\r\nalready commenced. But measures can easily be taken to prevent them\r\nfrom entering into the commerce of other spices. In regard to pepper,\r\nwe would have to make it serve as a ballast. By this means we could\r\ngive it so cheaply that the other nations, finding scarcely any profit\r\nin it longer, would be obliged to cease trading in it themselves,\r\nwithout counting on our part our profits from the other merchandise.\r\n\r\nFor, according to my opinion, we could easily attract all the commerce\r\nof nutmegs and mace. For this purpose, instead of seizing Banda,\r\nand building a fort there, which would cost considerable, and give\r\nus a bad reputation among the Indian princes, the following is what\r\nI think that we should do.\r\n\r\nAs the king of Macassar is a powerful prince, whose country is densely\r\npopulated, and well supplied with rice and all manner of food; and as\r\nhe furnishes them to Malacca and Banda: it would be necessary to make\r\na treaty with him, and to send him three vessels with two hundred men\r\nfor his country. This number, together with the Macassar men, would be\r\nsufficient to attack Banda, and we would promise the king to deliver\r\nit into his hands, without claiming any recompense for this aid,\r\nexcept that no other nation but our own could load merchandise there,\r\nand that the nutmegs and mace would be taken annually at a fixed price,\r\nnamely, at the selling price at the time of the expedition.\r\n\r\n[Matelief is certain that the king of Macassar will acquiesce,\r\nand would also probably be willing to build a trading-house for\r\nthe Dutch. Other conditions for the security of Banda might also be\r\nimposed in the treaty.]\r\n\r\nOf the clove-trade, it is very difficult for us to render ourselves\r\nmasters. We have the product of Amboina, Luho, and Cambelo; but not\r\nthat yielded by the Moluccas. The only means of obtaining it is to\r\ndrive the Spaniards from Ternate, and it can easily be imagined that\r\nthe task is not easy. However I shall not hesitate to write here my\r\nthought concerning the matter.\r\n\r\nThe thing does not appear impossible to me, if one wishes to build on a\r\nfirm foundation. This would require a return to the Malacca affair. For\r\nhad the Portuguese lost Malacca, they could not easily go from Goa to\r\nreënforce the Moluccas; and I do not think there would be much trouble\r\nin preventing the sending of supplies to Ternate from the Manilles.\r\n\r\nFirst, we should have to send three or four vessels to the king of\r\nMindanao, whose country is densely inhabited, and who, as report\r\nruns, can launch fifty caracoas. All this fleet would go to Panama or\r\nPanati [i.e., Panay] which is near the Manilles, and where there is\r\na place named Otting [i.e., Oton], guarded by but eighteen Spanish\r\nsoldiers with about the same number of other inhabitants, so that\r\nin all there are but forty whites. This place would be destroyed,\r\nor if the blacks of Mindanao wished to keep it, it would be given\r\nthem, for it is a country abounding in rice and several other foods,\r\nwhich are transported to Ternate.\r\n\r\nThence I would suggest going directly to the Manilles to destroy\r\nall the vessels in their ports, so that they could not aid\r\nTernate. Immediately a vessel of one hundred and sixty or two hundred\r\ntons would be sent back to Mindanao, which would cross with the king's\r\ncaracoas to the strait of Tagima, to capture the vessels that should\r\ntry still to go to Ternate, because there is no other route. After\r\ncapturing one or two of them, no other vessels would dare to try it,\r\nso that Ternate would perish from famine. For did we try at present\r\nto overpower the island by force, I believe that the Spaniards could\r\nfortify it so strongly, and have so many men there, that large armies\r\nwould be required to drive them out.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult for them to provide Ternate with cloth, for the\r\nlittle taken there now is brought by the Chinese to the Manilles. This\r\nwant of cloth would not fail to trouble the inhabitants, and it would\r\nhave to be sent from Malacca, and that could not be done easily. If\r\na galley could also be taken to Ternate, it would greatly annoy the\r\nSpaniards....\r\n\r\nThe commerce of China depends moreover upon Malacca. If the Portuguese\r\nwere driven from that place, the Chinese would have to give up that\r\ntraffic....\r\n\r\nThe commerce of cotton stuffs at Coromandel is of great importance,\r\nfor all the inhabitants of the Indias dress in those stuffs, and must\r\nhave them at any price. There are different styles for each nation,\r\naccording to their taste, and they make them so in different places\r\n... If Malacca were taken from the Portuguese, they would have no\r\nfurther favorable opportunity for the trade in cloth....\r\n\r\nIf no means are found to besiege Malacca again, the Portuguese might\r\nmake use of their fustas to hinder our trade with Coromandel. For,\r\nsince this entire coast is low, and the fustas draw but little\r\nwater, they could always station themselves between the shore and our\r\nvessels. Besides it is very dangerous for vessels to anchor there. If\r\nthe enemy is spry, he could carry the news to Goa in one week, whence\r\nthey could easily despatch their fleets against us.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, if the Portuguese could be driven from Malacca,\r\nthey would have to renounce trade on the Coromandel coast; for\r\nthey would have no safe course, should they wish to get cloth,\r\nand they could gain nothing, for the expense would overbalance the\r\nprofit. Consequently, I believe that all the commerce of the Portuguese\r\nin the East Indies depends on Malacca, and that, in order to cut it,\r\none must take that place.\r\n\r\nAfter that, there is no doubt that the inhabitants of Bantam would\r\nnot be reasonable, when they would see us in fixed establishments,\r\nand would understand that since the English had no other commerce in\r\nthe Indias than that of pepper, they would not care to make frequent\r\nvoyages, or great expenses. The pepper of Jambeo, Andragyri, and\r\nother points, that is taken to Bantam, would be taken to Malacca,\r\nwhere, also, cloth for the return cargo would be found.\r\n\r\nI have not learned whether the Portuguese have any strength at\r\nBengale. All whom I have heard speak of that country say that a good\r\ncommerce can be obtained there....\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable to send two vessels to Arracan to try to\r\ntrade. Besides the king is very anxious for us to go there. A\r\nPortuguese, one Philippe de Britto, has a fort there, with a\r\ngarrison of eighty men. This fort is fifty leagues inland, and Britto\r\nholds the entire country in check. Although the king of Arracan is\r\npowerful, he has been unable as yet to find means for driving out\r\nthis Portuguese. This alarms all the kingdom of Pegu, especially\r\nsince it is annoyed by civil wars. That country has immense wealth,\r\nespecially in precious gems.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that anything can be done with Cambaie while the\r\nPortuguese have forts on the Malabar coast, and while the king is not\r\nbetter disposed toward us. We must wait until he knows us better,\r\nand until his mind is disabused concerning the Spaniards. For,\r\nuntil he gives us permission to trade in his ports, we would always\r\nencounter great danger, since large vessels can not enter. Besides\r\nthat country is so near Goa, that the Portuguese would be notified as\r\nsoon as we arrived there, and would pounce upon us with their forces,\r\nso that we could hope for neither help nor protection.\r\n\r\nAll the above points to Malacca's importance, for the establishment\r\nthat we wish to make in the Indias. Therefore, for that reason, we\r\nshould reflect on it well. For, in short, it is time now for us to\r\nassure ourselves of a fixed place and of a retreat. And this place\r\nor that place that one might select, would cost immense sums before\r\nit could reach the present condition of Malacca. Besides it will be\r\nvery difficult to find a place so advantageous.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe second expedition of Paul van Caerden (1606-1609) consisted of\r\neight vessels, equipped at a cost of 1,825,135 livres. Its chief\r\nresult was the capture of the Spanish fort at Machian and the two\r\ncaptures of the commander, who finally died in prison at Manila. The\r\nexpedition sailed April 20, 1606, and shortly afterward began to have\r\ntrouble with the Portuguese. After rounding the cape they besieged\r\nand took a Portuguese trading-post, after which they cruised past\r\nGoa, Calcutta, and other places, finally sighting Sumatra, January 5,\r\n1607, and anchoring at Bantam, January 6. There they met the Matelief\r\nexpedition. With a half-hearted following of Matelief's advice, van\r\nCaerden anchored at Amboina in March, whence on May 10, he started\r\nfor Ternate. His capture by the Spanish of Ternate, the taking of the\r\nSpanish fort at Machian--the place \"most abounding in cloves of all\r\nthe Moluccas\"--and other operations on land and sea followed. The\r\nexpedition finally left Ternate on August 3, 1608, and by way of\r\nBantam, reached Holland August 6, 1609, with a portion of its vessels.\r\n\r\nThe few years succeeding, events came thick and fast. Dutch\r\ninterests in the Indias multiplied. The taking of Malacca was\r\nagain considered. Resistance to Portuguese and Spanish interests\r\nbecame even more pronounced, while the English and the Dutch came\r\nto definite agreements, between their respective trading companies\r\nas to trade in the Indias. The Dutch opened trade communication with\r\nJapan. They became thoroughly established in the Moluccas, in Amboina,\r\nand in the islands of Banda. The Spanish under Governor Juan de Silva\r\nof Manila, took the offensive, and opposed the Dutch vigorously,\r\nmaintaining certain forts in Ternate, from which the efforts of the\r\nDutch failed to dislodge them. A Dutch fleet of thirteen vessels, with\r\nPierre Verhoeven as Admiral, and Francois Wittert as vice-admiral,\r\nleft Holland in 1607. Their course carried them along the shores of\r\nIndia, before Malacca, and among the islands of Sumatra, Java, and\r\nothers. They had communication with vessels of other Dutch commanders,\r\namong them those of the ill-fated van Caerden, who was exchanged by the\r\nSpaniards March 23, 1610, proclaimed general of all the Moluccas July\r\n1, 1610, and shortly after captured again by the Spaniards. They had\r\ncertain negotiations also with the English. At Borneo, Amboina, Banda,\r\nTernate, and their neighboring islands many important negotiations\r\nwere carried on, looking ever to the strengthening and prepetuation\r\nof Dutch power. The war with the Banda islanders was at length\r\nsettled satisfactorily, although it required a number of years. In\r\nthis period came the twelve years' truce between Spain and Holland,\r\nor the States-general, but notwithstanding active hostilities between\r\nthe two nations occurred afterward, the defeat and capture of Wittert's\r\nvessels near Manila Bay occurring after news of the truce had reached\r\nthe Indias. In September of 1610 two vessels returning to Holland met\r\nseven vessels under Admiral Both, in which were the first Dutch women\r\nsent to the Indias. About 1613 the Spanish force in the Moluccas is\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"... The Spaniards have control of the city of Gammalamma, in the\r\nisland of Ternate, which they took from the inhabitants. They call\r\nit Nuestra Signora di Rosario. It has a wall and bastions built of\r\nstone. It is abundantly provided with cannon and war-supplies, which\r\nare sent from the Manilles.\r\n\r\n\"It is at present garrisoned by 200 Spaniards and 90 Papaugos [i.e.,\r\nPampangos (?)] who are inhabitants of the Philippines, who are well\r\ndisciplined in arms, and serve as Spanish soldiers. There are also\r\n30 Portuguese families, 60 or 80 Chinese families, who engage in\r\ndifferent trades, and 50 or 60 Christian Molucca families.\r\n\r\n\"They have another fort between Gammalamma and Malaia, called\r\nSts. Peter and Paul, located on an elevation, and mounted with six\r\npieces of cannon. There are thirty-three cast-iron cannon in the first\r\nfort. The garrison of the latter consists generally of 27 Spaniards,\r\n20 Papaugos, and some other people from the Manilles.\r\n\r\n\"They possess all the island of Tidore, where they have three forts,\r\nnamely, that of Taroula, located in the large city where the king\r\nlives. It is stronger than the other two by its situation, which is\r\non an elevation. Its garrison is usually 50 Spaniards, and 8 or 10\r\nPapaugos. It has ten large cast-iron cannon.\r\n\r\n\"The second fort is the old Portuguese castle taken by Corneille\r\nBastiaansz, which the Spaniards have retaken. It has 13 Spaniards,\r\nwith several islanders, and 2 pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\n\"The third is named Marieco, and is in sight of Gammalamma....Its\r\ngarrison consists of 14 Castilians and a few Papaugos, and it has two\r\npieces of cannon....The wars have somewhat depopulated the country....\"\r\n\r\n[The Spaniards also possessed several forts in Gilolo: Sabougo, taken\r\nfrom the Dutch by Juan de Silva in 1611; Gilolo, also taken from the\r\nDutch by the same governor; and Aquilamo. All these forts contained\r\nlight garrisons. On the island of Moro, the Spaniards had the forts\r\nJolo, Isiau, and Joffougho. They usually maintained in the sea a\r\nnumber of vessels. Juan de Silva is described as a brave, energetic,\r\nand diplomatic man. The second capture of van Caerden proved a decided\r\nblow to the Dutch, because of the loss of certain important papers.]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch power in the Moluccas was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We have three forts at Ternate: that of Malaia, or Orange, commenced\r\nby Admiral Matelief, where the king of Ternate lives; that of Toluco,\r\nor Hollande, lying at the east end of the island, on an elevation,\r\none-half legua north of that of Malaia, built of stone; for fear lest\r\nthe Spaniards occupy this post, and for the same reason to send there\r\nto live a portion of the superfluous men at Malaïa.\r\n\r\n\"Our third fort is that of Tacomma or Willemstad, lying at the\r\nnorthwest. It was constructed by Admiral Simon Jansz Hoen....\"\r\n\r\n[In the island of Machian, they possessed the fort of Taffalo and\r\nTabillola. In Bachian they had a fort called Gammedource. All these\r\nforts were adequately garrisoned.]\r\n\r\nBy 1627 affairs were still more flourishing and Batavia in Bantam,\r\non the island of Java, had already been made a base of supplies. Spain\r\nstill maintained forts at Ternate in that year. Signs of a desire to\r\nattack the Spaniards in the Philippines began to be manifest.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Wittert's expedition, defeat, and death, the following\r\nhas been translated and condensed from Journal de l'amiral Wittert,\r\n1607-10 (Liége, 1875), a small pamphlet in the library of Columbia\r\nUniversity, New York.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1607, the Company of the East Indies despatched thirteen\r\nvessels to find the Portuguese fleet, and probably to attack it, off\r\nMosambique or in neighboring waters. Pierre Willemsz, of Amsterdam,\r\nwas appointed admiral of this fleet; and François de Wittert, of the\r\nancient baronial family of that name--seignior of Hoogeland, Emeeclaar,\r\netc.--was made vice-admiral and president of the council-in-ordinary,\r\nwith full power to take the place of the admiral, who was very old\r\nand infirm.\" The flagships of these officers were of eight hundred\r\nand one thousand tons, respectively. The entire fleet carried two\r\nthousand eight hundred to two thousand nine hundred men, forty-two\r\npieces of brass artillery and two hundred and eighty-three of\r\niron, one hundred stone-mortars, with the necessary munitions, and\r\nprovisions for more than three years. This armament cost ten million\r\neight hundred livres. The fleet set sail from the Texel on December\r\n22, 1607, and reached \"the fort of Mosambique\" on the twenty-eighth\r\nof July following. The Dutch besieged the fort, but were obliged to\r\nretreat (August 13). \"In this siege 30 of our men were killed, and 85\r\nwounded. We fired 2,250 cannon-shots at this fortress, which is the\r\nmost important one possessed by the Portuguese in the East Indies;\r\nit has four bastions and three ramparts. But after this siege, it\r\nwas almost entirely ruined, and the Portuguese power is destroyed,\r\nespecially as regards the puissant empire of the Abissinians, whose\r\nemperor is named Preter-Jan [i.e., Prester John].\" On November 5,\r\n1608, the Dutch fleet reached Sumatra, where a naval battle with\r\nsome Portuguese vessels ensued. In January, 1609, Wittert went,\r\nwith some of the ships, to Johor, and aided the king of that state\r\nto resist the Portuguese. On February 15, the fleet anchored at\r\nBantam, and on April 8, at Nera, one of the isles of Banda, where\r\nthey built a fort. Here, on May 22, the admiral and many of his\r\nofficers were treacherously assassinated by the natives. Here the\r\njournal ends. Another and later entry reads: \"Letters from Moluque\r\n[Maluco] bring the news that on June 12, 1610, the admiral François\r\nWittert, while having some junks unloaded at Manila, was surprised by\r\nthe Spanish and slain in the combat. He was attacked by more than 12\r\nvessels at once, but defended himself for a long time. The 'Amsterdam'\r\nwas finally captured by four ships which attacked it at once--one of\r\nwhich, however, the Dutch blew up--and was taken to Manila with 51\r\ndead on board, including the admiral; the yacht 'Faucon' had 34 dead,\r\nand all its officers were slain except two--Piérre Gervits, master\r\nof the yacht, and Piérre Hertsing--who were wounded. The 'Faucon'\r\nalso was carried away, with 22 dead. [170] The Spaniards made 120\r\nprisoners on the two ships. As for the other vessels in their company\r\nthe yacht 'Aigle' was blown up; the 'Paon' and the shallop 'Delft'\r\nescaped. It is not exactly known whither these vessels have gone;\r\nbut it is believed that they went to Patan.\"\r\n\r\nWith the increase of Dutch power in the Indias, complications\r\nnaturally multiplied. The year spent by Pierre van den Broeck\r\nin the eastern seas, saw conflicts on the Indian coast, in Java,\r\nagainst the English and Javanese, and also with the Portuguese. Van\r\nden Broeck was in the service of the Dutch Trading Company for over\r\nseventeen years. He went first to the Indias in the expedition under\r\nGerard Reyust, which left Holland May 3, 1613. On June 1, 1615,\r\nhe embarked with Admiral Verhagen for the Moluccas. He played an\r\nimportant part in the establishment of Batavia in 1619, and in the\r\ntroubles with the English and Javanese. The truth of the inadequacy\r\nof the natives against the more progressive races was proved again,\r\nas it had previously been proved by the experiences of Portuguese\r\nand Spanish. A siege of Batavia in 1629, by the Javanese failed in\r\nits purpose. Van den Broeck returned to Holland June 6, 1630.\r\n\r\nThe second Dutch voyage to the East Indies under command of Georges\r\nSpilberg sailed from Holland August 8, 1614, with six vessels. Its\r\nobject was chastisement of the Spanish. Reaching the Strait of\r\nMagellan, March 28, 1615, after many adventures with the Portuguese\r\nalong the Brazilian coast, the fleet made the passage, and debouched\r\ninto the South Sea on May 6. Thence they coasted the western shores of\r\nSouth America, and as far as Acapulco in New Spain. Near Lima a sea\r\nfight with the Spanish occurred, in which the latter were worsted,\r\nand three ships destroyed. When some of the Spanish who were in the\r\nwater called piteously for help, after saving the first and second\r\npilot, and a few sailors, \"we left the remainder to the mercy of the\r\nwaves.\" The chronicle adds \"Nevertheless some of the sailors killed\r\nseveral who were swimming, and struggling against death--which they did\r\nin disobedience to their orders.\" At Acapulco, the Spanish received the\r\nDutch well and some change of prisoners was effected. On November 18,\r\n1615, the fleet turned westward, and sighted the Ladrones by January\r\n1, 1616. On February 9, the cape of Espiritu Santo was sighted, and\r\non the 19th, under the guidance of native pilots, they sailed toward\r\nManila Bay, and anchored that same day near Luzón. \"Our intention\r\nwas to make some Spaniard prisoner, in order to gain more detailed\r\ninformation of what had been told us at Capul, namely, that a fleet had\r\nbeen awaiting us for many days at the Manilles, and we wished eagerly\r\nto learn more particular news of it.\" It was learned that the Spanish\r\nfleet under Juan de Silva had gone to the Moluccas to aid the Spanish\r\nthere. Consequently, the Dutch fleet, after an ineffectual attempt\r\nto exchange prisoners at Manila, went (March 10) to the Moluccas. On\r\nthe way they received assurance of the hatred in and about Mindanao\r\nfor the Spaniards, and their willingness to join the Dutch.\r\n\r\nReaching the Moluccas they cruised about for some time, and finally\r\ntwo of the vessels were sent back to Holland, reaching that country,\r\nJuly 1, 1617. With them they took the celebrated Jacques le Maire\r\nwho had attempted to find a new passage to the South Sea, below the\r\nStrait of Magellan. As his voyage was not for the trading company\r\nwhich enjoyed the monopoly of trade in the Indias, his ship was\r\nconfiscated. He died on the passage home. [171]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Dutch were later in their explorations and conquests\r\nthroughout the Indias and neighboring regions than other nations,\r\ntheir activity carried them to all the places visited or conquered by\r\nthe latter. As years went on the contests of the Dutch with the Spanish\r\ntended to lessen, while those with the natives increased. Women went\r\nto the new colonies in greater number, and life gradually assumed\r\na more settled aspect. The strenuous efforts of the Dutch sent\r\nthem into Formosa, China, Japan, and other countries. Expeditions\r\nof more or less ships multiplied. The names of the Dutch famous in\r\nthe annals of the eastern seas are numerous. Their efforts, first\r\nand foremost, were the establishment of a sound commerce.

I. The reader is\r\nreferred to the preface of that volume for some account of the book,\r\nand of the manner in which it is presented in this series.\r\n\r\nContinuing his narrative, Morga describes his voyage to Mexico,\r\nwhither he goes (1603) to be a member of the Audiencia there. He then\r\nrelates the events of the Chinese uprising in Luzón in that year,\r\nwhich has been fully described in previous volumes of this series;\r\nand his picturesque although plain narrative casts new light upon that\r\nepisode. Many Spaniards in Manila are so alarmed by this danger that\r\nthey remove, with all their households and property, to Nueva España;\r\nbut one of the ships carrying them is lost at sea, and the other is\r\ncompelled, after great injury and loss, to return to Manila--a serious\r\ncalamity for the colony there. The governor does his best to fortify\r\nthe city, and reënforcements and supplies are provided for him from\r\nNueva España. Bishop Benavides dies (1605). Friars from the islands\r\ngo to Japan, but the emperor of that country is offended at their\r\npreaching, and advises Acuña to restrain them. In the summer of 1605\r\narrive supplies and men from Nueva España, and Acuña proceeds with his\r\npreparations for the expedition against the Dutch in the Moluccas. In\r\nthe following spring he sets out on this enterprise, conducting it\r\nin person; Morga describes this naval campaign in detail. Ternate is\r\ncaptured by the Spaniards without bombardment, and with little loss to\r\nthemselves. The fugitive king of the island is persuaded to surrender\r\nto the Spaniards and become a vassal of Felipe. Several other petty\r\nrulers follow his example and promise not to allow the Dutch to engage\r\nin the clove trade. Acuña builds a new fort there, and another in\r\nTidore, leaving Juan de Esquivel as governor of the Moluccas, with\r\na garrison and several vessels for their defense, and carrying to\r\nManila the king of Ternate and many of his nobles, as hostages. During\r\nAcuña's absence a mutiny occurs among the Japanese near Manila, which\r\nis quelled mainly by the influence of the friars. The governor dies,\r\napparently from poison, soon after his return to Manila. The trade\r\nof the islands is injured by the restrictions laid upon it by the\r\nhome government; and the reduction of Ternate has not sufficed to\r\nrestrain the Moro pirates. The natives of the Moluccas are uneasy and\r\nrebellious, especially as they have a prospect of aid from the Dutch,\r\nwho are endeavoring to regain their lost possessions there. Morga cites\r\na letter from a Spanish officer at La Palma, recounting the purpose\r\nand outcome of van Noordt's expedition to the Indian archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe historical part of Morga's account ends here; and the final\r\nchapter is devoted to a description of the islands and their people,\r\nthe customs and religious beliefs of the natives, and the condition at\r\nthat time of the Spanish colony and the city of Manila. He describes\r\nthe principal islands of the Philippine group, beginning with Luzón;\r\nthe various races of inhabitants--Moros, Negritos, and Visayans:\r\ntheir mode of dress, their occupations and industries, their habits\r\nof life; their weapons, their ships and boats; the trees and fruits of\r\nthe islands; the animals and birds, both wild and tame; the reptiles,\r\nfishes, and other creatures; and various plants. Among these is the\r\nbuyo (or betel); the habit of chewing it has become universal among the\r\nSpaniards, of all classes, and poison is often administered through\r\nits medium. Various means and methods of poisoning are described,\r\nas well as some antidotes therefor. Some account is given of the\r\ngold mines and pearl fisheries, and of other products of the country\r\nwhich form articles of commerce. Morga describes the two great lakes\r\nof Luzón (Bombon and Bai), Manila and its harbor and approaches, and\r\nother principal ports, with some neighboring islands; and gives some\r\naccount of the Visayan people and the larger islands inhabited by them,\r\nand of the tides in the archipelago. Then follows an interesting and\r\ndetailed account of the Filipino peoples, their language, customs,\r\nbeliefs, etc. The language used in Luzón and other northern islands\r\nis different from that of the Visayas; but all the natives write,\r\nexpressing themselves fluently and correctly, and using a simple\r\nalphabet which resembles the Arabic. Their houses, and their mode\r\nof life therein, are fully described; also their government, social\r\norganization, and administration of justice. The classes and status\r\nof slaves, and the causes of enslavement are recounted. Their customs\r\nin marriages and dowries, divorces, adoption, and inheritance are\r\ndescribed; also in usury, trading, and punishment for crimes. The\r\nstandard of social purity is described by Morga as being very low;\r\nyet infamous vices were not indigenous with them, but communicated by\r\nforeigners, especially by the Chinese. The natives of Luzón appear\r\nto be superior, both intellectually and morally, to the Visayan\r\npeoples. Their religious beliefs and practices are recounted by Morga,\r\nwho naturally ascribes these to the influence of the devil. He also\r\nnarrates the entrance of Mahometanism into the islands, and how it\r\nwas checked by the coming of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nMorga next sketches the condition at that time of Spanish colonies\r\nin the islands. He describes the city of Manila in detail, with\r\nits fortifications, arsenals, government and municipal buildings,\r\ncathedral, and convents; also the seminary of Santa Potenciana, and\r\nthe hospitals. There are six hundred houses, mostly built of stone,\r\nwithin the walls, and even more in the suburbs; \"and all are the\r\nhabitations and homes of Spaniards.\" All the people, both men and\r\nwomen, are clad and gorgeously adorned in silks; and nowhere is there\r\ngreater abundance of food, and of other necessaries of human life,\r\nthan in Manila. Morga enumerates the dignitaries, ecclesiastical\r\nand civil, who reside in the city; and mentions it as the center\r\nand metropolis of the archipelago. He then briefly describes the\r\nother Spanish settlements in the Philippines; and mentions in their\r\nturn the various orders and their work there, with the number of\r\nlaborers in each. He praises their efforts for the conversion,\r\neducation, and social improvement of the Indians. He defines the\r\nfunctions of both the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities,\r\nand the policy of the government toward the natives; and describes\r\nthe application and results in the Philippines of the encomienda\r\nsystem imported thither from America. He deprecates the permission\r\ngiven to the Indians for paying their tributes in kind or in money,\r\nat their option; for it has led to their neglecting their former\r\nindustries, and thus to the general damage of the country. Slavery\r\nstill exists among them, but the Spaniards have been forbidden to\r\nenslave the natives. Personal services of various sorts are due\r\nfrom the latter, however, to their encomenderos, to the religious,\r\nand to the king, for all of which they receive a moderate wage; and\r\nall other services for the Spaniards are voluntary and paid. Close\r\nrestrictions are laid upon the intercourse of the Spaniards with\r\nnatives. Various information is given regarding appointments to\r\noffice, residencias, elections, town government, and finances; also\r\nof the ecclesiastical organization, expenses, and administration,\r\nas well as of the incomes of the religious orders. Morga recounts\r\nthe numbers, character, pay, and organization of the military and\r\nnaval forces in the islands. The bulk of the citizens are merchants\r\nand traders, commerce being the chief occupation and support of the\r\nSpanish colony. Manila is a market for all the countries of Eastern\r\nAsia, from Japan to Borneo. The China trade is restricted to the\r\ninhabitants of the Philippines; Morga describes its nature and extent,\r\nand the manner in which it is conducted, as well as the character\r\nand methods of the Chinese traders. A similar account is given of the\r\ntrade carried on with the Philippines by the Japanese, Borneans, and\r\nother neighboring peoples, and of the shipment to Nueva España of the\r\ngoods thus procured. This last commerce is \"so great and profitable,\r\nand easy to control, that the Spaniards do not apply themselves to,\r\nor engage in, any other industry,\" and thus not only they neglect to\r\navail themselves of and develop the natural resources of the country,\r\nbut the natives are neglecting and forgetting their former industries;\r\nand the supply of silver in the country steadily flows out of it and\r\ninto the hands of infidels. Morga enumerates the officials, revenues,\r\nand expenditures of the colonial government. As its income is too small\r\nfor its necessary expenses, the annual deficit is made up from the\r\nroyal treasury of Nueva España. But this great expense is incurred\r\n\"only for the Christianization and conversion of the natives, for\r\nthe hopes of greater fruits in other kingdoms and provinces of Asia.\"\r\n\r\nThe large extent of the Chinese immigration to the islands is\r\ndisapproved by Morga, as unsafe to the Spaniards and injurious to the\r\nnatives. Some Chinese are needed for the service of the Spaniards,\r\nfor all the trades are carried on by them; but the number of Chinese\r\nallowed to live in the islands should be restricted to those who are\r\nthus needed. Morga describes the character, dress, mode of life,\r\nand settlements of the Chinese near Manila; they are cared for in\r\nreligious matters by the Dominican friars. The Christian Chinese live\r\napart from the heathens, in a settlement of some five hundred people;\r\nMorga has but a poor opinion of even these converts. Some account is\r\nalso given of the Japanese who have settled in Manila; Morga commends\r\nthem, and states that they prove to be good Christians.\r\n\r\nHe ends his work by a detailed account of the navigation and voyage\r\nto and from the Philippines. The Mexican port of departure for this\r\nroute has been removed from Navidad to Acapulco. Morga describes the\r\nwestward voyage; the stop at the Ladrone Islands, and the traffic\r\nof the natives with the ships; and the route thence, and among the\r\nPhilippine Islands. The return route to Mexico is much more difficult\r\nand dangerous; for the winds are varying and not always favorable,\r\nand the ship must change its course more frequently, and go far north\r\nto secure favoring winds, there encountering cold weather. These severe\r\nchanges cause much suffering, and even death; and the vessel makes this\r\nvoyage without once touching land until it reaches Acapulco, a period\r\nof five or six months. Morga also describes the voyage to Spain by\r\nway of Goa and the Cape of Good Hope, which also is long and dangerous.\r\n\r\nTHE EDITORS\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCESOS DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS\r\n\r\n(concluded)\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Antonio de Morga.

Hall,\r\nand James Alexander Robertson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS IN THE FILIPINAS ISLANDS. [172]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTH (concluded)\r\n\r\nOn the tenth [of July] [173] of the same year, the vessels\r\n\"Espiritu-Santo\" and \"Jesus Maria\" left the port of Cabit en route\r\nfor Nueva España--in the wake of two smaller vessels, which had been\r\ndespatched a fortnight before--with the Filipinas merchandise. Don Lope\r\nde Ulloa was their commander, while Doctor Antonio de Morga left those\r\nislands in the almiranta, the \"Santo Espiritu,\" to fill the office of\r\nalcalde of the court of Mexico. Before leaving the bay, both vessels\r\nwere struck head on by a storm, and went dragging upon the coast,\r\nbuffeted by the heavy seas and winds, and amid dark and tempestuous\r\nweather, from three in the afternoon until morning of the next day,\r\nnotwithstanding that they were anchored with two heavy cables in the\r\nshelter of the land, and their topmasts struck. Then they grounded\r\nupon the coast, in La Pampanga, ten leguas from Manila. The storm\r\nlasted for three more consecutive days. Consequently it was regarded\r\nas impossible for those vessels to sail and make their voyage,\r\ninasmuch as the season was now well advanced, and the vessels\r\nwere very large and heavily laden, and were deeply imbedded in the\r\nsand. Advice was immediately sent overland to Manila, whence were\r\nbrought several Chinese ships, cables, and anchors. By dint of the\r\ngreat efforts exerted, both vessels, each singly, were fitted with\r\ntackle and cables, which were rigged at the stern. There awaiting the\r\nhigh tide, the ships were drawn, by force of capstan and men, stern\r\nfirst for more than one legua through a bank of sand, upon which\r\nthey had struck, until they were set afloat, on the twenty-second\r\nof July, St. Magdelen's day. Immediately they set sail again,\r\nas the vessels had sustained no injury, nor sprung any leak; and\r\nthey made their voyage and navigation, under light winds, to the\r\ncoast of Nueva España. A violent south-southwest gale, accompanied\r\nby heavy showers, hail, and cold, struck the ship \"Espiritu Sancto\"\r\non the tenth of November, in forty-two degrees, and within sight of\r\nland. The wind was blowing obliquely toward the shore, upon which the\r\nvessel was almost wrecked several times. The vessel suffered distress\r\nand lost its rigging, while the crew was worn out by the voyage and\r\nwith the cold. The storm lasted until November twenty-second. On the\r\nmorning of that day, while the ship was in the trough of the waves,\r\nand with topmasts shipped, it was struck by a squall of rain and hail,\r\naccompanied by great darkness. A thunderbolt, descending the mainmast,\r\nstruck the vessel amidships. It killed three men besides wounding and\r\nmaiming eight others; it had entered the hatches, and torn open the\r\nmainhatch, with a blaze of light, so that the interior of the ship\r\ncould be seen. Another thunderbolt fell down along the same mast\r\namong the entire crew, and stunned sixteen persons, some of whom\r\nwere speechless and unconscious all that day. It left the vessel\r\nby the pump-dale. The next day, the wind veered to north-northeast,\r\nwhereupon the ship set sail, and went coasting along the land, with\r\nsufficient winds until the nineteenth of the month of December,\r\nwhen it made port at Acapulco. There were found the two smaller\r\nvessels that had sailed first from Manila. Three days later, General\r\nDon Lope de Ulloa entered the same port of Acapulco, in the ship\r\n\"Jesus Maria.\" That vessel had sustained the same storms as the ship\r\n\"Espiritu Sancto.\" From the time when the two vessels had separated,\r\non sailing out of the channel of Capul, in the Filipinas Islands,\r\nthey had not sighted one another again during the entire voyage.\r\n\r\nIn the same year six hundred and three, Governor Don Pedro de Acuña\r\nsent the ship \"Sanctiago\" from Manila to Japon, with merchandise. It\r\nwas ordered to make its voyage to Quanto, in order to comply with\r\nthe desire and wish of Daifusama. As news had been already received\r\nof the death of Fray Geronimo de Jesus, four of the most important\r\nreligious of his order in Manila--namely, Fray Diego de Bermeo\t[174]\r\n(who had been provincial), Fray Alonso de la Madre de Dios, Fray\r\nLuys Sotello, [175] and one other associate--sailed on that vessel\r\nfor the said kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ships \"Jesus Maria\" and \"Espiritu Sancto\" sailed for\r\nNueva España, and the ship \"Sanctiago\" with the religious for Japon,\r\nthere was more time to discuss further the matter started by the\r\ncoming of the Chinese mandarins. For finding themselves unoccupied\r\nwith other matters, fear of the Sangleys became universal, and the\r\nsuspicions that were current that the Sangleys were about to commit\r\nsome mischievous outbreak. This the archbishop and some religious\r\naffirmed and told, publicly and privately. At this time, a considerable\r\nnumber of Chinese were living in Manila and its environs. Some of\r\nthem were baptized Christians living in the settlements of Baibai\r\nand Minondoc, [176] on the other side of the river, opposite the\r\ncity. Most of them were infidels, occupied and living in these same\r\nsettlements and in the shops of the parián in the city; [they were\r\nemployed] as merchants and in all other occupations. The majority of\r\nthem were fishermen, stonecutters, charcoal-burners, porters, masons,\r\nand day-laborers. Greater security was always felt in regard to the\r\nmerchants, for they are the better class of people, and those who are\r\nmost interested, because of their property. So great security was not\r\nfelt about the others, even though they were Christians; because, as\r\nthey are a poor and covetous people, they would be inclined to any act\r\nof meanness. However, it was always thought that it would be difficult\r\nfor them to cause any commotion, unless a strong fleet came from China,\r\non which they could rely. Talk continued to increase daily, and with\r\nit suspicion; for some of the Chinese themselves, both infidels and\r\nChristians, in order to prove themselves friends of the Spaniards,\r\nand clean from all guilt, even told the Spaniards that there was\r\nto be an insurrection shortly, and other similar things. Although\r\nthe governor always considered these statements as fictions and the\r\nexaggerations of that nation, and did not credit them, yet he was\r\nnot so heedless that he did not act cautiously and watch, although\r\nwith dissembling, for whatever might happen. He took pains to have\r\nthe city guarded and the soldiers armed, besides flattering the most\r\nprominent of the Chinese and the merchants, whom he assured of their\r\nlives and property. The natives of La Pampanga and other provinces\r\nnear by were instructed beforehand to supply the city with rice and\r\nother provisions, and to come to reënforce it with their persons and\r\narms, should necessity arise. The same was done with some Japanese in\r\nthe city. As all this was done with some publicity, since it could\r\nnot be done secretly, as so many were concerned, one and all became\r\nconvinced of the certainty of the danger. Many even desired it,\r\nin order to see the peace disturbed, and to have the opportunity\r\nto seize something. [177] From that time, both in the city and its\r\nenvirons, where the Sangleys were living scattered, these people began\r\nto persecute the Sangleys by word and deed. The natives, Japanese and\r\nsoldiers of the camp took from them their possessions and inflicted on\r\nthem other ill-treatment, calling them dogs and traitors, and saying\r\nthat they knew well that they meant to rebel. But they said they would\r\nkill all the Sangleys first, and that very soon, for the governor was\r\npreparing for it. This alone was sufficient to make it necessary for\r\nthe Sangleys to do what they had no intention of doing. [178] Some\r\nof the most clever and covetous set themselves to rouse the courage\r\nof the others, and to make themselves leaders, telling the Sangleys\r\nthat their destruction was sure, according to the determination which\r\nthey saw in the Spaniards, unless they should anticipate the latter,\r\nsince they [the Sangleys] were so numerous, and attack and capture the\r\ncity. They said that it would not be difficult for them to kill the\r\nSpaniards, seize their possessions, and become masters of the country,\r\nwith the aid and reënforcements that would immediately come to them\r\nfrom China, as soon as the auspicious beginning that they would have\r\nmade in the matter should be known. In order to do this when the time\r\ncame, it was advisable to build a fort and quarters in some retired and\r\nstrong place near the city, where the people could gather and unite,\r\nand where arms and supplies could be provided for the war. At least\r\nsuch a fort would be sufficient to assure there their lives from the\r\noutrages that they were expecting from the Spaniards. It was learned\r\nthat the chief mover in this matter was a Christian Sangley, an\r\nold-time resident in the country, named Joan Bautista de Vera. [179]\r\nHe was rich and highly esteemed by the Spaniards, and feared and\r\nrespected by the Sangleys. He had often been governor of the latter,\r\nand had many godchildren and dependents. He had become an excellent\r\nSpaniard, and was courageous. He himself, exercising duplicity and\r\ncunning, did not leave the city, or the houses of the Spanish during\r\nthis time, in order to arouse less suspicion of himself. From there\r\nhe managed the affair through his confidants; and in order to assure\r\nhimself better of the result, and to ascertain the number of men of\r\nhis race, and to make a census and list of them, he cunningly had\r\neach of them ordered to bring him a needle, which he pretended to\r\nbe necessary for a certain work that he had to do. These needles he\r\nplaced, as he received them, in a little box; and when he took them\r\nout of it, he found that he had sufficient men for his purpose. They\r\nbegan to construct the fort or quarters immediately at a distance of\r\nslightly more than one-half legua from the village of Tondo, among some\r\nestuaries and swamps, and in a hidden location. [180] They stored there\r\nsome rice and other provisions, and weapons of little importance. The\r\nSangleys began to gather there, especially the masses--the common\r\npeople and day-laborers; for those of the parián, and the mechanics,\r\nalthough urged to do the same, did not resolve to do it, and remained\r\nquiet, guarding their houses and property. The restlessness of the\r\nSangleys daily continued to become more inflamed. This, and the\r\nadvices given to the governor and the Spaniards, kept the latter\r\nmore anxious and apprehensive, and made them talk more openly of the\r\nmatter. The Sangleys, seeing that their intention was discovered, and\r\nthat delay might be of so great harm to them, determined, although the\r\ninsurrection was planned for St. Andrew's day, the last of November,\r\nto anticipate that day, and to lose no more time. On Friday, the third\r\nday of the month of October, the eve of St. Francis, they collected\r\nvery hurriedly in the above-mentioned fort; consequently, by nightfall,\r\nthere were two thousand men in it. Joan Bautista de Vera--a thief in\r\nthe rôle of an honest man, since he was the leader and organizer of the\r\ntreason--went immediately to the city and told the governor that the\r\nSangleys had risen, and that they were collecting on the other side of\r\nthe river. The governor, suspecting the mischief, had him immediately\r\narrested and carefully guarded; and he was afterward executed. Then,\r\nwithout tap of drum, the governor ordered the companies, both of\r\nthe camp and the city, to be notified, and all to hold their arms in\r\nreadiness. Very shortly after nightfall, Don Luys Dasmariñas, who was\r\nliving near the monastery and church of Minondoc, on the other side of\r\nthe river, came hurriedly to the city to advise the governor that the\r\nSangleys had revolted. He asked for twenty soldiers to go to the other\r\nside [of the river], where he would guard the said monastery. Cristoval\r\nde Axqueta, sargento-mayor of the camp, went with these men, together\r\nwith Don Luys. As the silence of night deepened, the noise made by the\r\nSangleys grew louder, for they were continuing to assemble and were\r\nsounding horns and other instruments, after their fashion. Don Luys\r\nremained to guard the monastery, with the men brought from Manila,\r\nwhere he had placed in shelter many women and children of Christian\r\nSangleys, with the religious. The sargento-mayor returned immediately\r\nto the city, where he told of what was being done. The call to arms\r\nwas sounded, for the noise and shouts of the Sangleys, who had sallied\r\nout to set fire to some houses in the country, was so great that it\r\nwas thought that they were devastating that district. The Sangleys\r\nburned, first, a stone country-house belonging to Captain Estevan\r\nde Marquina. The latter was living there with his wife and children;\r\nand none of them escaped, except a little girl, who was wounded, but\r\nwho was hidden in a thicket. [181] Thence the Sangleys went to the\r\nsettlement of Laguio, [182] situated on the shore of the river, and\r\nburned it. They killed several Indians of that settlement, and the rest\r\nfled to the city. There the gates were already shut and all the people,\r\nwith arms in hand, manned the walls and other suitable posts, ready\r\nfor any emergency, until dawn. The enemy, who now had a greater number\r\nof men, retired to their fort, to make another sally thence with more\r\nforce. Don Luys Dasmariñas, who was guarding the church and monastery\r\nof Minondoc, expected hourly that the enemy was about to attack him,\r\nand sent a messenger to the governor to beg for more men. These were\r\nsent him, and consisted of regulars and inhabitants of the city,\r\nunder Captains Don Tomas Brabo de Acuña (the governor's nephew),\r\nJoan de Alcega, Pedro de Arzeo, and Gaspar Perez, by whose counsel and\r\nadvice Don Luys was to be guided on this occasion. All was confusion,\r\nshouting, and outcry in the city, particularly among the Indians, and\r\nthe women and children, who were coming thither for safety. Although,\r\nto make certain of the Sangleys of the parián, their merchants had\r\nbeen asked to come into the city, and bring their property, they did\r\nnot dare to do so; for they always thought that the enemy would take\r\nthe city because of their great force of numbers, and annihilate the\r\nSpaniards, and they would all be in danger. Consequently they preferred\r\nto remain in their parián, in order to join the victorious side. Don\r\nLuys Dasmariñas thought it advisable to go in search of the enemy\r\nimmediately with the reënforcements sent him by the governor, before\r\nthey should all assemble and present a strong front. He left seventy\r\nsoldiers in Minondoc, in charge of Gaspar Perez; while with the rest,\r\nabout one hundred and forty of the best picked arquebusiers, he\r\nwent to the village of Tondo, in order to fortify himself in the\r\nchurch, a stone building. He arrived there at eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning. The Chinese, in number one thousand five hundred, arrived\r\nat the same place at the same time, bent on the same purpose. An\r\nhour's skirmish took place between the two sides, as to which one\r\nwould gain the monastery. Captain Gaspar Perez came up with the\r\nreënforcement of the men left at Minondoc. The enemy retired to his\r\nfort, with a loss of five hundred men. Gaspar Perez returned to his\r\npost, where Pedro de Arzeo was also stationed. Don Luys Dasmariñas,\r\nexultant over this fortunate engagement, determined immediately to\r\npress forward in pursuit of the enemy with his men, notwithstanding\r\nthe heat of the sun and without waiting to rest his followers. He sent\r\nAlferez Luys de Ybarren to reconnoiter. The latter brought word that\r\nthe enemy was in great force, and near by. Although Juan de Alcega\r\nand others requested Don Luys to halt and rest his men, and await\r\nthe governor's orders as to what was to be done, his desire not to\r\nlose the opportunity was so great that, rousing his men with harsh\r\nwords, in order to make them follow him, he marched forward until\r\nthey reached a swamp. After leaving the swamp, they came suddenly\r\ninto a large clearing, where the enemy was stationed. The latter,\r\nupon seeing the Spaniards, surrounded them in force on all sides,\r\narmed with clubs, some with catans, and a few with battle-axes. Don\r\nLuys and his men, not being able to retreat, fought valiantly, and\r\nkilled a number of Sangleys. But finally, as the latter were in so\r\ngreat force, they cut all the Spaniards to pieces, only four of whom\r\nescaped, badly wounded; and these carried the news to Manila. [183]\r\nThis result was of great importance to the Sangleys, both because so\r\nmany and the best Spanish soldiers were killed in this place, and\r\nbecause of the weapons that the Sangleys took from them, and which\r\nthey needed. With these arms they flattered themselves that their\r\nobject was more certain of accomplishment. Next day, October five,\r\nthe Sangleys sent the heads of Don Luys, Don Tomas, Joan de Alcega,\r\nand other captains to the parián; and they told the Sangleys there\r\nthat, since the flower of Manila had been killed, they should revolt\r\nand join them, or they would immediately come to kill them. The\r\nconfusion and grief of the Spaniards in the city was so great that\r\nit prevented them from taking the precautions and exercising the\r\ndiligence demanded by the affair. But the sight of their necessity,\r\nand the spirit of their governor and officials made them all remain\r\nat their posts on the walls, arms in hand. They fortified as strongly\r\nas possible the gates of the parián and of Dilao, and all that part of\r\nthe wall where the enemy might make an assault. They mounted a piece of\r\nartillery above each gate, and stationed there the best men, among whom\r\nwere religious of all the orders. Upon that day, Sunday, the enemy,\r\nflushed with the victory of the preceding day and their army swelled\r\nby the additional men that joined them, attacked the city. Burning\r\nand destroying everything in their path, they went to the river, for\r\nthere was no vessel with which to resist them, as all those of the\r\nfleet were in the provinces of the Pintados. They entered the parián,\r\n[184] and furiously assaulted the city gate, but were driven back\r\nby the arquebuses and muskets, with the loss of many Sangleys. They\r\nwent to the church of Dilao, and there assaulted the gate and walls\r\n(which were there lower), by means of scaling-ladders, with the same\r\ndetermination. But they experienced the same resistance and loss,\r\nwhich compelled them, on the approach of night, to retire with great\r\nloss to the parián and to Dilao. That whole night the Spaniards\r\nspent in guarding their wall, and in preparing for the morrow. The\r\nenemy passed the night in the parián and at Dilao, making carts,\r\nmantelets, scaling-ladders, artificial fire, and other contrivances,\r\nfor approaching and assaulting the wall, and for burning the gates,\r\nand setting fire to everything. At dawn of the next day, Monday, the\r\nSangleys came together with these arms and tools, and having reached\r\nthe wall with their bravest and best-armed men, attacked it with\r\ngreat fury and resolution. The artillery destroyed their machines, and\r\ncaused them so great injury and resistance with it and the arquebuses,\r\nthat the Sangleys were forced to retire again to the parián and\r\nto Dilao, with heavy loss. Joan Xuarez Gallinato, accompanied by\r\nsome soldiers and a Japanese troop, made a sally from the Dilao gate\r\nupon the Sangleys. They reached the church, when the Sangleys turned\r\nupon them and threw the Japanese into disorder. The latter were the\r\ncause of all retreating again to seek the protection of the walls,\r\nwhither the Sangleys pursued them. At this juncture Captain Don Luys de\r\nVelasco entered Manila. He came from the Pintados in a stout caracoa,\r\nmanned by some good arquebusiers, while others manned some bancas that\r\nsailed in the shelter of the caracoa. They approached the parián and\r\nDilao by the river, and harassed the enemy quartered there on that and\r\nthe two following days, so that they were compelled to abandon those\r\npositions. These vessels set fire to the parián, and burned everything,\r\nand pursued the enemy wherever they could penetrate. The Sangleys,\r\nupon beholding their cause waning, and their inability to attain the\r\nend desired, resolved to retire from the city, after having lost more\r\nthan four thousand men; to advise China, so that that country would\r\nreënforce them; and for their support to divide their men into three\r\ndivisions in different districts--one among the Tingues of Passic, the\r\nsecond among those of Ayonbon, and the third at La Laguna de Bay, San\r\nPablo, and Batangas. On Wednesday they abandoned the city completely,\r\nand, divided as above stated, marched inland. Don Luys de Velasco,\r\nwith some soldiers and armed Indians who came from all sides to the\r\nrelief of Manila, accompanied by some Spaniards who guided them, and\r\nthe religious from their missions, went by way of the river in pursuit\r\nof them, and pressed them, so that they killed and annihilated the\r\nbands bound for the Tingues of Passic and for Ayombon. The majority\r\nand main body of the Sangleys went to La Laguna de Bay, the mountains\r\nof San Pablo, and Batangas, where they considered themselves more\r\nsecure. Burning towns and churches, and everything in their path, they\r\nfortified themselves in the above-mentioned sites. Don Luys de Velasco,\r\nwith seventy soldiers, continued to pursue them, killing each day a\r\ngreat number of them. On one occasion Don Luys was so closely engaged\r\nwith the enemy, that the latter killed him and ten soldiers of his\r\ncompany, and fortified themselves again in San Pablo and Batangas,\r\nwhere they hoped to be able to sustain themselves until the arrival\r\nof reënforcements from China. [185]\r\n\r\nThe governor, fearful of this danger, and desirous of finishing\r\nthe enemy, and giving entire peace to the country, sent Captain\r\nand Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca with soldiers\r\nto pursue and finish the enemy. This man left with two hundred\r\nSpaniards--soldiers and volunteers--three hundred Japanese, and\r\none thousand five hundred Pampanga and Tagál Indians, [186] on the\r\ntwentieth of October. He was so expeditious, that with little or no\r\nloss of men, he found the Sangleys fortified in San Pablo and Batangas,\r\nand, after fighting with them, killed and destroyed them all. None\r\nescaped, except two hundred, who were taken alive to Manila for the\r\ngalleys. The captain was occupied in this for twenty days, and with it\r\nthe war was ended. Very few merchants were left in Manila, and they had\r\ntaken the good counsel to betake themselves, with their possessions,\r\namong the Spaniards in the city. At the beginning of the war there were\r\nnot seven hundred Spaniards in the city capable of bearing arms. [187]\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the war, the need of the city began, for, because\r\nof not having Sangleys who worked at the trades, and brought in\r\nall the provisions, there was no food, nor any shoes to wear,\r\nnot even at excessive prices. The native Indians are very far from\r\nexercising those trades, and have even forgotten much of farming, and\r\nthe raising of fowls, cattle, and cotton, and the weaving of cloth,\r\nwhich they used to do in the days of their paganism and for a long\r\ntime after the conquest of the country. [188] In addition to this,\r\npeople thought that Chinese vessels would not come to the islands\r\nwith food and merchandise, on account of the late revolution. Above\r\nall, they lived not without fear and suspicion that, instead of\r\nthe merchant vessels, an armed fleet would attack Manila, in order\r\nto avenge the death of their Sangleys. All conspired to sadden the\r\nminds of the Spaniards. After having sent Fray Diego de Guevara,\r\nprior of the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila, to the court of\r\nEspaña by way of India, with news of this event--but who was unable\r\nto reach Madrid for three years, because of his various fortunes\r\nin India, Persia, and Italia, through which countries he went--they\r\nimmediately sent Captain Marco de la Cueva, together with Fray Luys\r\nGandullo of the Order of St. Dominic, to the city of Macao in China,\r\nwhere the Portuguese were living, with letters for the chief captain\r\nand the council of that city. These letters advised the latter of\r\nthe revolt of the Sangleys, and of the result of the war, so that,\r\nif they should hear any rumors of a Chinese fleet, they could send\r\nword. At the same time letters were taken from the governor to the\r\nTutons, Aytaos, and visitors of the provinces of Canton and Chincheo,\r\nrecounting the outbreak of the Chinese, which obliged the Spaniards\r\nto kill them. Upon their arrival at Macao, Marcos de la Cueva and\r\nFray Luys Gandullo found no news of a fleet, but that everything was\r\nquiet--although the Chinese had already heard of the insurrection and\r\nmuch of the result, from some Sangleys who had fled from Manila in\r\nchampans, upon that occasion. It was immediately learned in Chincheo\r\nthat these Spaniards were in Macao, whereupon Captains Guansan Sinu\r\nand Guachan, wealthy men and usually engaged in trade with Manila,\r\nwent to look for them. Having learned the truth of the event, they\r\ntook the letters for the mandarins and promised to deliver them. They\r\nurged other merchants and vessels of Chincheo, who were afraid, to go\r\nto Manila that year. This was very useful, for through them much of the\r\nnecessity that the city [of Manila] was suffering was supplied. With\r\nthis result and with some powder, saltpeter, and lead which Marcos\r\nde la Cueva had provided for the magazines, the latter left Macao,\r\nand sailed to Manila, which he reached in May, to the universal joy\r\nof the city over the news that he brought--which began to be verified\r\nimmediately by the coming of the fleet of thirteen Chinese vessels\r\nbearing food and merchandise.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June of this year six hundred and three, [189] two\r\nvessels were despatched from Manila to Nueva España, under command\r\nof Don Diego de Mendoça who had been sent that year by the viceroy,\r\nMarques de Montesclaros, with the usual reënforcements for the\r\nislands. The flagship was \"Nuestra Señora de los Remedios\" and the\r\nalmiranta \"Sant Antonio.\"\r\n\r\nMany rich men of Manila, warned by the past troubles, took passage\r\nin these vessels with their households and property, for Nueva\r\nEspaña--especially in the almiranta--with the greatest wealth that\r\nhas ever left the Filipinas. Both vessels experienced so severe\r\nstorms during the voyage, in the altitude of thirty-four degrees,\r\nand before having passed Japon, that the flagship, without masts and\r\ngreatly lightened and damaged, put back in distress to Manila. The\r\nalmiranta was swallowed up in the sea, and no one was saved. This was\r\none of the greatest shipwrecks and calamities that the Filipinas have\r\nsuffered since the past ones.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of that year and that of six hundred and five, until\r\nthe sailing of the vessels which were to go to Castilla, [190] the\r\ngovernor occupied himself in repairing the city, and supplying it with\r\nprovisions and ammunition, with the special object and care that the\r\ndecision which he was awaiting from the court for making an expedition\r\nto Maluco--of which he had been advised and warned--should not find\r\nhim so unprepared as to cause him to delay the expedition. In this\r\nhe was very successful, for at that same time, the master-of-camp,\r\nJoan de Esquivel, had arrived in Mexico with six hundred soldiers\r\nfrom España. In Mexico more men were being enrolled, and a great\r\npreparation was made of ammunition, food, money, and arms, which the\r\nviceroy sent to the governor from Nueva España in March of that year,\r\nby order of his Majesty, in order that he might go to Maluco. All\r\nthis arrived safely and in due season at Manila.\r\n\r\nShortly after the ships had left Manila for Nueva España, and those\r\ndespatched thence by the viceroy had entered, Archbishop Don Fray\r\nMiguel de Benavides died of a long illness. His body was buried\r\namid the universal devotion and grief of the city. [191] At this\r\nsame time, Don Pedro de Acuña received three letters, by the ships\r\nthat continued to come from China that year, with the merchandise and\r\nwith their principal captains. They were all of the same tenor--when\r\ntranslated into Castilian--from the Tuton and Haytao, and from the\r\ninspector-general of the province of Chincheo, and were on the matter\r\nof the insurrection of the Sangleys and their punishment. They were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n[This letter occupies folios 113b-115a of the original edition of\r\nMorga. We have already presented that document in our V0L. XIII,\r\np. 287, which is translated from a copy of the original manuscript. The\r\nanswer of Acuña to this letter will be found in V0L. XIV, in the\r\nsecond document of that volume.]\r\n\r\nThe letter of the inspector-general was written on the twelfth of\r\nthe second month--which according to our reckoning is March of the\r\ntwenty-third year of the reign of Vandel [i.e., Wanleh]. The eunuch's\r\n[192] letter was written on the sixteenth of the said month and year;\r\nand that of the viceroy, on the twenty-second of the month.\r\n\r\nThe governor answered these letters through the same messengers,\r\ncivilly and authoritatively. He gave an explanation of the deed and\r\njustified the Spaniards, and offered friendship and trade anew with the\r\nChinese. He said that their property, which had remained in Manila,\r\nwould be restored to the owners, and that those imprisoned in the\r\ngalleys would be freed in due season. First, however, he intended to\r\nuse them for the Maluco expedition, which he was undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe entrances into various provinces of Japon by the discalced\r\nreligious of St. Francis and those of St. Dominic and St. Augustine,\r\ncontinued to be made, both in the Castilian vessel itself which was\r\ndespatched that year to the kingdoms of Quanto,  [193] and in other\r\nJapanese vessels which came to Manila with the silver and flour of the\r\nJapanese, in order to trade. This was permitted and allowed by Daifu,\r\nnow called Cubosama, who that year sent the governor, through one of\r\nhis servants, certain weapons and presents, in return for others which\r\nthe governor had sent him. He answered the latter's letter as follows:\r\n\r\nLetter from Daifusama, lord of Japon, to governor Don Pedro de Acuña,\r\nin the year one thousand six hundred and five.\r\n\r\nI received two letters from your Lordship, and all the gifts and\r\npresents mentioned in the memorandum. Among them, when I received them,\r\nthe wine made from grapes pleased me greatly. During former years,\r\nyour Lordship requested permission for six vessels, and last year for\r\nfour, and I always granted your request. But, what angers me greatly is\r\nthat among the four vessels that your Lordship requested was that one\r\ncalled \"Antonio,\" which made the voyage without my orders. This was a\r\nvery lawless act, and in contempt of me. Can it be, perhaps, that your\r\nLordship would send to Japon without my permission any vessel that you\r\nwished? Besides this, your Lordship and others have often negotiated\r\nabout the sects of Japon, and requested many things in regard to\r\nthem. This likewise I cannot concede; for this region is called Xincoco\r\n[Shinkoku], or \"dedicated to the idols.\" These have been honored with\r\nthe highest adoration from the time of our ancestors until now, and\r\ntheir acts I alone cannot undo or destroy. Consequently, it is not at\r\nall advisable that your religion be promulgated or preached in Japon;\r\nand if your Lordship wish to preserve friendship with these kingdoms of\r\nJapon and with me, do what I wish, and never do what is displeasing to\r\nme. Lastly, many have told me that many wicked and perverse Japanese,\r\nwho go to that kingdom and live there for many years, afterward return\r\nto Japon. This makes me very angry. Consequently, your Lordship will,\r\nin the future, allow no one of the Japanese to come here in the\r\nvessels that come from your country. In other matters, your Lordship\r\nshall act advisedly and prudently, and shall so conduct affairs,\r\nthat henceforth I may not be angered on account of them.\r\n\r\nThe governor, carrying out his dearest wish, was to make the\r\nexpedition to Terrenate in the Malucos, which should be done quickly,\r\nbefore the enemy could gather more strength than he had then; for\r\nhe had been informed that the Dutch, who had seized the island\r\nand fortress of Amboino, had done the same with that of Tidore,\r\nwhence they had driven the Portuguese who had settled therein, and\r\nhad entered Terrenate, where they had established a trading-post for\r\nthe clove-trade. Accordingly, as soon as the despatches in regard to\r\nthis undertaking arrived from España, in June of six hundred and five,\r\nand the men and supplies from Nueva España, which were brought at the\r\nsame time by the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, the governor spent\r\nthe balance of this year in preparing the ships, men, and provisions\r\nthat he deemed necessary for the undertaking. Leaving behind in\r\nManila sufficient force for its defense, he went to the provinces of\r\nPintados, where the fleet was collected, in the beginning of the year\r\nsix hundred and six.\r\n\r\nBy the fifteenth day of the month of March, the governor had thoroughly\r\nprepared the fleet--which consisted of five ships, four galleys with\r\npoop-lanterns [galeras de fanal], three galliots, four champans, three\r\nfuneas, two English lanchas, two brigantines, one barca chata [194]\r\nfor the artillery, and thirteen fragatas with high freeboard. There\r\nwere one thousand three hundred Spaniards, counting regulars, captains\r\nand officers, substitutes [entretenidos], and volunteers. Among\r\nthem were some Portuguese captains and soldiers, under charge of\r\nthe chief captain of Tidore, [195] who was at that island when the\r\nDutch seized it. These Portuguese came from Malaca to serve in the\r\nexpedition. There were also four hundred Indian pioneers--Tagáls and\r\nPampangos of Manila--who went to serve at their own cost, under their\r\nown officers, and with their own weapons. There was a quantity of\r\nartillery of all kinds, ammunition, tools, and provisions for nine\r\nmonths. [196] Don Pedro de Acuña left the point of Hilohilo, which\r\nis near the town of Arevalo in the island of Panai, [on the above\r\nday] with all this equipment, and coasting the island of Mindanao,\r\nmade port at La Caldera, in order to replenish his water, wood,\r\nand other necessaries.\r\n\r\nThe governor embarked in the galley \"Santiago\" and took under\r\nhis charge the other galleys and oared vessels. The ship \"Jesus\r\nMaria\" acted as flagship of the other vessels, and was commanded\r\nby the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel. Captain and Sargento-mayor\r\nCristoval de Azcueta Menchaca acted as admiral of the fleet, which,\r\nafter attending to its necessities at La Caldera, left that port. On\r\nsetting sail, the flagship, which was a heavy vessel, was unable to\r\nleave port, and the currents drove it shoreward so that, without the\r\nothers being able to help it, it grounded. It was wrecked there, but\r\nthe crew, artillery, and a portion of its ammunition and clothing,\r\nwere saved. After setting fire to the ship, and taking what nails and\r\nbolts they could, so that the Mindanaos could not make use of them,\r\nthe fleet continued its voyage. The galleys coasted along the island\r\nof Mindanao, and the ships and other deep-draught vessels sailed in\r\nthe open sea, all making for the port of Talangame, in the island of\r\nTerrenate. The vessels, although experiencing some changes of weather,\r\nfirst sighted the islands of Maluco, after they had been reconnoitered\r\nby a large Dutch ship, well equipped with artillery, which was anchored\r\nat Terrenate. This vessel fired some heavy artillery at our vessels,\r\nand then immediately entered the port, where it fortified itself under\r\nshelter of the land, and with its artillery and crew and the people\r\nof Terrenate. The master-of-camp went with his vessels to the island\r\nof Tidore, where he was well received by the Moro chiefs and cachils;\r\nfor the king was away, as he had gone to the island of Bachan to be\r\nmarried. The master-of-camp found four Dutch factors there, who were\r\ntrading for cloves. He learned from them that the ship at Terrenate\r\nwas from Holland, and was one of those which had sailed from Amboino\r\nand seized Tidore, whence it had driven the Portuguese, and that it was\r\nbeing laden with cloves. It was awaiting other vessels of its convoy,\r\nfor they had made friendship and treaties with Tidore and Terrenate,\r\nin order to be protected against the Castilians and Portuguese. The\r\nmaster-of-camp had the king of Tidore summoned immediately, and,\r\nwhile awaiting Don Pedro de Acuña, rested his men and cleaned the\r\nships, and made gabions and other things necessary for the war. Don\r\nPedro de Acuña, through his pilots' fault, had gone thirty leguas\r\nto leeward of the island of Terrenate toward the island of Celebes,\r\notherwise called Mateo. Recognizing that island, he returned to\r\nTerrenate, and passing in sight of Talangame, discovered the Dutch\r\nvessel. He tried to reconnoiter it, but after seeing that it was\r\nharming his galleys with its artillery, and that the master-of-camp\r\nwas not there, he proceeded to Tidore, where he found the latter,\r\nto the great joy of all. There they spent the remainder of the month\r\nof March. At this juncture the king of Tidore arrived, with twelve\r\nwell-armed caracoas. He expressed joy at the governor's coming, to\r\nwhom he complained at length of the tyranny and subjection in which\r\nhe was kept by Sultan Zayde, [197] king of Terrenate, who was aided\r\nby the Dutch. He offered to go in person to serve his Majesty in the\r\nfleet, with six hundred men of Tidore. Don Pedro received him and\r\nfeasted him. Then, without any further delay at Tidore, or any more\r\nconcern about the ship at Talangame, he set about the chief purpose\r\nfor which they had come. On the last of March he started to return to\r\nTerrenate. On that day he anchored in a harbor between the settlement\r\nand the port, as did also the king of Tidore with his caracoas. That\r\nsame night the Dutch ship weighed anchor and went to Amboino. At dawn\r\nof next day, April first, soldiers were landed with some difficulty,\r\nwith the intention of marching along the shore (which was a very close\r\nand narrow stretch) to the fort, in order to plant the artillery,\r\nwith which to bombard it. As the governor thought that mischief would\r\nensue because of the narrowness and closeness of the pass, he landed\r\na number of pioneers on the high ground, to open another road, so\r\nthat the remainder of the army might pass, and the enemy be diverted\r\nin several directions. By these efforts, he placed his camp under\r\nthe walls, although a great number of Terenatans came from various\r\ndirections to prevent him. The vanguard of the camp was in charge\r\nof Joan Xuarez Gallinato and Captains Joan de Cuevas, Don Rodrigo\r\nde Mendoça, Pasqual de Alarcon, Joan de Cervantes, Captain Vergara,\r\nand Cristoval de Villagra, with their companies. The other captains\r\nwere in the body of the squadron. The rearguard was under command of\r\nCaptain Delgado, while the master-of-camp aided in all parts. The\r\narmy came up within range of the enemy's artillery, which suddenly\r\nbegan to play. The governor came to see how the troops were formed,\r\nand, leaving them at their post, returned to the fleet to have the\r\npieces brought out for bombarding, and to obtain refreshment for\r\nthe soldiers. Some high trees intervened between the troops and the\r\nwall, in which the enemy had posted some scouts to reconnoiter the\r\nfield. They were driven down, and our own scouts posted there, who gave\r\nadvice from above of what was being done in the fort. Captain Vergara,\r\nand after him, Don Rodrigo de Mendoça and Alarcon, went to reconnoiter\r\nthe walls, the bastion of Nuestra Señora, and the pieces mounted on\r\nthe ground there, and a low wall of rough stone which extended to\r\nthe mountain, where there was a bastion in which the wall ended. It\r\nwas called Cachiltulo, and was defended with pieces of artillery and\r\na number of culverins, muskets, arquebuses, and pikes; while many\r\nother weapons peculiar to the Terenatans were placed along the wall\r\nfor its defense. Having seen and reconnoitered all this, although not\r\nwith impunity, because the enemy had killed six soldiers with the\r\nartillery and wounded Alferez Joan de la Rambla in the knee with a\r\nmusket-ball, the Spaniards returned to the army. A trifle past noon,\r\na lofty site was reconnoitered, in the direction of the bastion of\r\nCachiltulo, whence the enemy could be attacked and driven from the\r\nwall; and Captain Cuevas was ordered to occupy it with twenty-five\r\nmusketeers. Having done this, the enemy sent out a crowd of men\r\nto prevent him from occupying it. A skirmish ensued, and the Moros\r\nturned and retreated to their wall. Cuevas followed them so closely\r\nand persisted so long, that he needed reënforcement. The scouts in\r\nthe trees gave information of what was being done, whereupon Captains\r\nDon Rodrigo de Mendoça, Alarcon, Cervantes, and Vergara reënforced\r\nhim with their light-armed pikemen and halberdiers. They pursued the\r\nenemy with so great rapidity and resolution that they entered the\r\nwalls behind them. However, some of the Spaniards were wounded, and\r\nCaptain Cervantes was pushed down from the wall and his legs broken,\r\nwhich caused his death. Captain Don Rodrigo de Mendoça, pursuing the\r\nenemy, who were retiring, ran inside the wall as far as the cavalier\r\nof Nuestra Señora, while Vergara ran in the opposite direction along\r\nthe curtain of the wall to the bastion of Cachiltulo, and went on\r\nas far as the mountain. By this time the main body of the army had\r\nalready assaulted the wall. Mutually aiding one another, they mounted\r\nthe wall and entered the place on all sides, although with the loss of\r\nsome dead and wounded soldiers. The soldiers were stopped by a trench\r\nbeyond the fort of Nuestra Señora, for the enemy had retreated to a\r\nshed, which was fortified with a considerable number of musketeers and\r\narquebusiers, and four light pieces. They discharged their arquebuses\r\nand muskets at the Spaniards, and threw cane spears hardened in fire,\r\nand bacacaes,  [198] after their fashion. The Spaniards assaulted the\r\nshed, whereupon a Dutch artilleryman trying to fire a large swivel-gun,\r\nwith which he would have done great damage, being confused did not\r\nsucceed, and threw down the linstock, turned, and fled. The enemy\r\ndid the same after him, and abandoned the shed, fleeing in all\r\ndirections. Those who would do so embarked with the king and some\r\nof his wives and the Dutch in one caracoa and four juangas  [199]\r\nwhich they had armed near the king's fort. Captain Vergara entered the\r\nfort immediately, but found it deserted. Don Rodrigo de Mendoça and\r\nVillagra pursued the enemy toward the mountain for a long distance,\r\nand killed many Moros. With this, at two o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nthe settlement and fort of Terrenate was completely gained. The\r\nSpanish banners and standards were flung from it, without it having\r\nbeen necessary for them to bombard the walls, as they had expected;\r\nand the fort was taken at so slight cost to the Spaniards. Their dead\r\nnumbered fifteen men, and the wounded twenty more. The whole town was\r\nreconnoitered, even its extremity--a small fort, called Limataen--which\r\ncontained two pieces of artillery, and two other pieces near the\r\nmosque on the seashore. The loot of the place was of small importance,\r\nfor already the things of most value, and the women and children,\r\nhad been removed to the island of Moro, whither the king fled and\r\ntook refuge in a fort that he had there. Some products of that land\r\nwere found, and a great quantity of cloves. In the factory of the\r\nDutch were found two thousand ducados, some cloth goods and linens,\r\nand many weapons, while in many places were excellent Portuguese and\r\nDutch artillery, a number of culverins and a quantity of ammunition,\r\nof which possession was taken for his Majesty.\t[200] A guard was\r\nplaced over what was gained, and the place was put in a condition\r\nfor defense with some pieces taken from the fleet, while the governor\r\nordered and provided whatever else was advisable.\r\n\r\nCachil Amuxa, the king's nephew and the greatest chief of Terrenate,\r\ncame with other cachils to make peace with the governor. He said\r\nthat he and all the Terenatans wished to be vassals of his Majesty,\r\nand that they would have rendered homage long before, but the king\r\nprevented them. The latter as a proud man, and, confident in his\r\nown opinion, although he had been advised to surrender the fort to\r\nhis Majesty and render him homage, had steadily refused to do so,\r\nhaving been encouraged and emboldened by the success that he had\r\ngained upon other occasions. That was the reason that he found himself\r\nin his present wretched condition. He offered to induce the king to\r\nleave the fort of Moro if given assurance of life. Don Pedro de Acuña\r\nreceived this Moro well, and as a Portuguese, Pablo de Lima--one of\r\nthose whom the Dutch had driven from Tidore, a man of high standing,\r\nand well acquainted with the king--offered to accompany him, the\r\ngovernor despatched them with a written passport as follows:\r\n\r\nPassport from Don Pedro de Acuña to the king of Terrenate\r\n\r\nI, Don Pedro de Acuña, governor, captain-general, and president of\r\nthe Filipinas Islands, and general of this army and fleet, declare\r\nthat, over my signature, I hereby give security of life to the king\r\nof Terrenate, in order that he may come to talk with me--both to him\r\nand those whom he may bring with him--reserving to myself the disposal\r\nof all the others as I may see fit. I certify this in his Majesty's\r\nname. And I order that no person of this fleet molest him or any of\r\nhis possessions, and that all observe what is herein contained. Given\r\nin Terrenate, April six, one thousand six hundred and six.\r\n\r\nDON PEDRO DE ACUÑA\r\n\r\nWithin nine days Cachilamuja and Pablo de Lima returned to Terrenate\r\nwith the king, the prince, his son, [201] and others of his relatives,\r\ncachils and sangajes, [202] under the said passport. They placed\r\nthemselves under the governor's power, and he received them with\r\ngreat affection and respect. He lodged the king and his son in a\r\ngood house in the settlement, under guard of a company. The king\r\nrestored the villages of Christians that his Majesty had possessed\r\nin the island of Moro, when the fort of Terrenate was lost by the\r\nPortuguese. He placed his person and kingdom in his Majesty's power,\r\nand surrendered a quantity of muskets and heavy artillery that he had\r\nin some forts of the said island. The governor did not despoil him\r\nof his kingdom, but on the contrary allowed him to appoint two of his\r\nmen to govern, whose choice was to be ratified by himself. The king,\r\nhis son the prince, and their cachils and sangajes swore homage to his\r\nMajesty. The kings of Tidore and Bachan, and the sangaje of La Bua did\r\nthe same, and covenanted and promised not to admit either the Dutch\r\nor other nations into Maluco for the clove-trade. They promised, as\r\nhis Majesty's vassals, to go on all occasions to serve him with their\r\npersons, men, and ships, whenever summoned by whomever commanded the\r\nfort of Terrenate; that they would oppose no obstacles to the Moros\r\nwho wished to become Christians; that if any wicked Christian went\r\nto their lands to turn renegade, they would surrender him; and other\r\nsuitable things. Therewith great and small were content and pleased,\r\nsince they were freed from the tyranny of the king of Terrenate. The\r\ngovernor remitted to them the third part of the tributes which they\r\nwere wont to pay their king, and gave the Moros other advantages. Then\r\nhe planned a new and modern fort, in a very conspicuous and suitable\r\nlocation, and began to build it. In order that the old fort might be\r\nbetter defended while the new one was being completed, he reduced it\r\nto a less size, by making new cavaliers and bastions, which he finished\r\nand furnished with ramparts and stout gates. He commenced another fort\r\nin the island of Tidore, on a good location near the settlement. After\r\nplacing in order whatever he judged necessary in Terrenate and Tidore,\r\nand in the other towns and fortresses of Maluco, he returned with\r\nhis fleet to the Filipinas. He left the master-of-camp, Joan de\r\nEsquivel, with a garrison of six hundred soldier--five hundred,\r\nin five companies, for Terrenate--in the fort of Terrenate to act\r\nas his assistant and as governor of Maluco; he also left there one\r\nlarge forge and a number of smiths, sixty-five pioneers, thirty-five\r\nstonecutters, two galliots, two well-armed brigantines, and crews of\r\nrowers. The other company of soldiers [was to be stationed] in Tidore\r\nunder command of Captain Alarcon; while ammunition and provisions for\r\none year were left in both forts. In order to be more assured of the\r\n[peaceful] condition of the country, he took the king of Terrenate\r\nfrom it and carried him to Manila, as well as his son the prince, and\r\ntwenty-four cachils and sangajes, most of them the king's relatives,\r\nto whom he showed every honor and good treatment. He explained to\r\nthem why he took them, and that their return to Maluco depended upon\r\nthe security and tranquillity with which the Moros should conduct\r\nthemselves in their obedience and service to his Majesty. [203] The\r\nthree Portuguese galliots returned to Malaca, taking with them the\r\nDutch who were in Maluco and the Portuguese captains and soldiers who\r\nhad come to take part in this expedition. The governor entered Manila\r\nin triumph with the remainder of the fleet, on the last day of May,\r\nsix hundred and six. He was received there with acclamations of joy\r\nand praise from the city, who gave thanks to God for so happy and\r\nprompt result in an undertaking of so great weight and importance.\r\n\r\nDuring the governor's absence in Maluco, the royal Audiencia of\r\nthe islands governed the Filipinas. The Audiencia wished to drive\r\na number of Japanese from the city, for they were a turbulent\r\npeople and promised little security for the country. When this\r\nwas attempted and force employed, the Japanese resisted, and the\r\nmatter came to such a pass that they took arms to oppose it, and\r\nit was necessary for the Spaniards to take their arms also. The\r\naffair assumed definite proportions, and some on either side wished\r\nto give battle. However, it was postponed by various means until,\r\nthrough the efforts of certain religious, the Japanese were quieted;\r\nand afterward as many as possible were embarked in vessels, although\r\nthey resented it greatly. This was one of the greatest dangers that\r\nhas threatened Manila, for the Spaniards were few in number, and the\r\nJapanese more than one thousand five hundred, and they are a spirited\r\nand very mettlesome race. Had they come to blows on this occasion,\r\nthe Spaniards would have fared ill.  [204]\r\n\r\nThe governor, upon entering Manila, took over immediately the affairs\r\nof his government, especially the despatching of two vessels about to\r\nsail to Nueva España. He was present in person in the port of Cabit\r\nat the equipment and lading of the ships, and the embarcation of the\r\npassengers. He was seized by some indisposition of the stomach which\r\ncompelled him to return to Manila and take to his bed. His pain and\r\nvomiting increased so rapidly that, without its being possible to\r\nrelieve him, he died in great anguish on St. John's day, to the great\r\nsorrow and grief of the country. Especially did the king of Terrenate\r\nshow and express his grief, for he had always received great honor\r\nand kind treatment from the governor. It was suspected that his death\r\nhad been violent, because of the severity and the symptoms of his\r\nillness. The suspicion increased, because the physicians and surgeons,\r\nhaving opened his body, declared, from the signs that they found, that\r\nhe had been poisoned, which made his death more regrettable. [205]\r\nThe Audiencia buried the governor in the monastery of St. Augustine\r\nat Manila, with the pomp and ostentation due to his person and\r\noffices. Then, again taking charge of the government, the Audiencia\r\ndespatched the vessels to Nueva España, whence advice was sent to\r\nhis Majesty of the taking of Maluco and the death of the governor.\r\n\r\nThe flagship, in which Don Rodrigo de Mendoça was sailing as general\r\nand captain, reached Nueva España quickly with this news. The\r\nalmiranta, notwithstanding that it left the islands at the same\r\ntime, delayed more than six months. Eighty persons who perished\r\nfrom disease were buried in the sea, while many others stricken by\r\nthe disease died of it upon landing at the port of Acapulco. Among\r\nthese was the licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera, auditor of Manila,\r\nwho had been appointed auditor of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAt the arrival of these vessels, it was learned that since the death\r\nof Don Pedro de Acuña, and the taking over of the government by the\r\nAudiencia, no change had occurred in the affairs of the islands;\r\nbut that their commerce was restricted because of the prohibition\r\nwhich forbade sending to the islands more than five hundred thousand\r\npesos each year of the proceeds from the sale of the merchandise in\r\nNueva España. On account of this the people were in need, as this\r\namount appeared little for the many Spaniards and for the extent\r\nof the trade--by which all classes are sustained, as they have no\r\nother resources or capital. Also, although the gaining of Maluco had\r\nbeen so important for affairs in those islands themselves, and their\r\npunishment for the reduction of the other rebels--especially those\r\nof Mindanao and Jolo, from whom the Filipinas had received so great\r\ninjury--the desirable quiet and stability had not been secured. For\r\nthe Mindanaos and the Joloans were not yet discontinuing their\r\ndescents upon the provinces of the Pintados in their war-vessels, to\r\nseize booty according to their custom--and this will continue until\r\na suitable expedition be sent against them--and Maluco affairs were\r\nnot failing to give Joan de Esquivel, the master-of-camp, sufficient\r\nto do. He was acting as governor there and had but little security\r\nfrom the natives, who, being a Mahometan people, and by nature easily\r\npersuaded and fickle, are restless, and ready for disturbances and\r\nwars. Daily and in different parts the natives were being incited\r\nand aroused to rebellion; and although the master-of-camp and his\r\ncaptains were endeavoring to punish and pacify them, they could not\r\ndo what was necessary to quiet so many disturbances as arose. The\r\nsoldiers were dying, and the food giving out; and the aid sent from\r\nManila could not arrive at the time or in so great quantity as was\r\nrequested, because of the perils of the voyage and the straits of\r\nthe royal treasury. [206] The coming of vessels to Maluco at this\r\ntime from Holanda and Zelanda was not less prejudicial to all our\r\ninterests; for the Dutch, having so great interests in the islands,\r\nand having established their interests there so firmly, were coming\r\nin squadrons by the India route, to recover what they had lost in\r\nAmboino, Terrenate, and other islands. With their countenance, the\r\nMoros were revolting against the Spaniards, who had their hands full\r\nwith them, and more so with the Dutch, for the latter were numerous,\r\nand more dangerous enemies than the natives.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch interest in these regions is so vast--both in the clove-trade\r\nand that of other drugs and spices, and because they think that\r\nthey will have a gateway there for the subjugation of the whole\r\nOrient--that, overcoming all the toil and dangers of the voyage,\r\nthey are continually coming to these islands in greater numbers and\r\nwith larger fleets. If a very fundamental and timely remedy be not\r\nadministered in this matter, it will increase to such an extent in\r\na short time that afterward no remedy can be applied.\r\n\r\nThe English and Flemish usually make this voyage by way of the strait\r\nof Magallanes. Francisco Draque [Drake] was the first to make it,\r\nand some years later Tomas Liscander [Candish or Cavendish], who\r\npassed by Maluco.\r\n\r\nLately Oliver del Nort, a Fleming, made the voyage. The Spanish fleet\r\nfought with his fleet amid the Filipinas Islands, at the end of the\r\nyear one thousand six hundred. In this fight, after the capture of\r\nhis almiranta (which was commanded by Lamberto Biezman) the flagship,\r\nhaving lost nearly all its crew, and being much disabled, took to\r\nflight. And as it afterward left the Filipinas, and was seen in Sunda\r\nand the Java channels, so disabled, it seemed impossible for it to\r\nnavigate, and that it would surely be lost, as was recounted above\r\nwhen treating of this.\r\n\r\nThis pirate, although so crippled, had the good fortune to escape from\r\nthe Spaniards, and, after great troubles and hardships, he returned\r\nto Amstradam with his ship \"Mauricio,\" with only nine men alive,\r\nreaching it on the twenty-sixth of August in the year six hundred\r\nand one. He wrote the relation and the events of his voyage, and gave\r\nplates of the battle and of the ships. This was afterward translated\r\ninto Latin and printed by Teodoro de Bri, a German, at Francfort, in\r\nthe year six hundred and two. Both relations are going the rounds,\r\nand the voyage is regarded as a most prodigious feat and one of so\r\ngreat hardships and perils.  [207]\r\n\r\nBartolome Perez, a pilot, gave the same news from the island of La\r\nPalma. He, having come from England by way of Holanda, conversed\r\nwith Oliver del Nort, and the latter narrated to him his voyage and\r\nsufferings, as mentioned by Licentiate Fernando de la Cueva in a\r\nletter from the island of La Palma, [208] on the last of July, of\r\nthe year six hundred and four, to Marcos de la Cueva, his brother,\r\nwho was a resident of Manila, and one of the volunteers who embarked\r\non the Spanish flagship which fought with the pirate. This letter is\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\nI answer two of your Grace's letters in this: one dated July, six\r\nhundred and one, and the other July, six hundred and two. In both\r\nof them your Grace relates to me the shipwreck that befell you and\r\nhow you saved yourself by swimming. Long before I saw your Grace's\r\nletters, I had learned of your mishap, whereat I was very anxious and\r\neven quite grieved; because of what was reported here, I imagined\r\nthat your Grace had a part in it. Consequently, I was singularly\r\noverjoyed at the assurance that your Grace still possessed life and\r\nhealth. Having them, one can conquer other things; and without them\r\nhuman treasure has no value. By way of Flandes (whence ships come\r\ndaily to this island), I learned much, nay, all the event, although\r\nnot so minutely. For Oliver de Nort, who was the Dutch general, with\r\nwhom the engagement occurred, arrived safely in Holanda, with eight\r\nmen--and he made nine--and without money. His purpose when he left\r\nthe rebellious states of Holanda and Zelanda, with five armed vessels\r\nladen with merchandise--which were worth, principal and merchandise,\r\none hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand ducados--was to trade\r\nand carry on commerce through the strait (and such were his orders),\r\nin whatever parts he should be, with friends or enemies. He was not to\r\nattack anyone, but only to defend himself and to incline the Indians to\r\ntrade and exchange with him. All the vessels having reached the strait\r\ntogether, three of them became separated there because of storms,\r\nand must have been wrecked; for up to the present nothing has been\r\nheard of them. Having seen himself so abandoned, and that he could\r\nnot restore his loss by trade, or else because he did not receive a\r\nhospitable reception from the inhabitants of Piru, he determined to\r\nexceed his orders, and make that voyage one of plundering. Accordingly\r\nhe stationed himself at the mouth of the river to await ships. The\r\nrest that befell, your Grace knows. Oliver de Nort is a native of the\r\ncity of Roterdam, and he reached it with an anchor of wood. [209]\r\nHe had no other with which to anchor, nor indeed had he any other\r\nleft. It is said that this is a very heavy wood of the Indias, and he\r\nhas placed it at the door of his house, as a mark of distinction. He\r\narrived, as I say, with nine men, all told, very much worn out, and as\r\nby a miracle. He has printed a book of his voyage, with engravings of\r\nhis vessels, and many other details of what happened to him, and the\r\nhardships that they endured in the fight and throughout the voyage,\r\nboth to show his own glory and to incite others to similar deeds.\r\n\r\nA pilot of this island, one Bartolome Perez, was seized and taken to\r\nInglaterra before the peace or truce. He came through Holanda, where\r\nhe conversed at great length with Oliver. The latter told him all that\r\nhad happened to him, which is known to all, and was discussed in this\r\nisland before that voyage. Bartolome Perez says that Oliver de Nort\r\npraised the Spaniards greatly, and said they were the bravest men he\r\nhad seen in his life. They had gained the deck of his ship, and all\r\nthe upper works, when he cried out from below deck to set fire to\r\nthe powder, whereupon he believes that the Spaniards left for fear\r\nof being blown up. The Dutch then had an opportunity to escape, but\r\nso crippled were they that their reaching port seems a miracle. The\r\npilot says that he saw the anchor and the book, and what pertains to\r\nthe book is stated here. I have recounted this to your Grace, because\r\nof the statements in your letter, namely, that people considered them\r\nas lost, and so that so singular a case may be known there.\r\n\r\nNow the Dutch make the voyage more quickly and more safely, going\r\nand coming, by way of India, but not touching at its ports or coasts,\r\nuntil they reach the islands of the Javas [210]--Java major and Java\r\nminor--and Samatra, Amboino, and the Malucas. Since they know the\r\ndistrict so well, and have experienced the immense profits ensuing to\r\nthem therefrom, it will be difficult to drive them from the Orient,\r\nwhere they have inflicted so many losses in both spiritual and\r\ntemporal affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n¶ Relation of the Filipinas Islands and of their natives, antiquity,\r\ncustoms, and government, both during the period of their paganism\r\nand after their conquest by the Spaniards, and other details.\r\n\r\n¶ CHAPTER EIGHTH\r\n\r\nThe islands of the eastern Ocean Sea, adjacent to farther Asia,\r\nbelonging to the crown of España, are generally called, by those who\r\nnavigate thither by way of the demarcation of Castilla and Castilla's\r\nseas and lands of America, \"the Western Islands;\" for from the time\r\nthat one leaves España, he sails in the course of the sun from east\r\nto west, until he reaches them. For the same reason they are called\r\n\"Eastern Islands\" by those who sail from west to east by way of\r\nPortuguese India, each of them circumscribing the world by voyaging\r\nin opposite directions, until they meet at these islands, which are\r\nnumerous and of varying size; they are properly called Filipinas,\r\nand are subject to the crown of Castilla. They lie within the tropic\r\nof Cancer, and extend from twenty-four degrees north latitude to the\r\nequinoctial line, which cuts the islands of Maluco. There are many\r\nothers on the other side of the line, in the tropic of Capricorn,\r\nwhich extend for twelve degrees in south latitude. [211] The ancients\r\naffirmed that each and all of them were desert and uninhabitable, [212]\r\nbut now experience has demonstrated that they deceived themselves;\r\nfor good climates, many people, and food and other things necessary\r\nfor human life are found there, besides many mines of rich metals,\r\nwith precious gems and pearls, and animals and plants, which nature\r\nhas not stinted.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to number all the islands--counting larger and\r\nsmaller--of this vast archipelago. Those comprised in the name and\r\ngovernment of Filipinas, number about forty large islands, besides\r\nother smaller ones, all consecutive. The chiefest and best known are\r\nLuzon, Mindoro, Tendaya, [213] Capul, Burias, Mazbate, Marinduque,\r\nLeite, Camar, Ybabao, Sebu, Panay, Bohol, Catenduanes, Calamianes,\r\nMindanao, and others of less renown.\r\n\r\nThe first island conquered and colonized by the Spaniards was\r\nSebu. [214] From there the conquest was started and continued in\r\nall the neighboring islands. Those islands are inhabited by people,\r\nnatives of the same islands, called Viçayas; or by another name,\r\nPintados--for the more prominent of the men, from their youth, tattoo\r\ntheir whole bodies, by pricking them wherever they are marked and then\r\nthrowing certain black powders over the bleeding surface, the figures\r\nbecoming indelible. But, as the chief seat of the government, and the\r\nprincipal Spanish settlement, was moved to the island of Luzon--the\r\nlargest island, and that one nearest and opposite to Great China and\r\nJapon--I shall treat of it first; for much that will be said of it is\r\nsimilar in the others, to each of whose particulars and distinctive\r\ndetails I shall pass in due time.\r\n\r\nThis island of Luzon extends lengthwise, from the point and head where\r\none enters the Filipinas Islands (by the channel of Capul, which\r\nlies in thirteen and one-half degrees north latitude) to the other\r\npoint in the province of Cagayan, called Cape Bojeador (and located\r\nopposite China, in twenty degrees), more than two hundred leguas. In\r\nsome parts its width is more constricted than in others, especially in\r\nthe middle of the island, where it is so narrow that it is less than\r\nthirty leguas from sea to sea, or from one coast to the other. The\r\nwhole island is more than four hundred leguas in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe climates of this island are not harmonious; on the contrary, they\r\npresent a great diversity in its different districts and provinces. The\r\nhead and beginning of the island, in the region of the channel, is more\r\ntemperate in the interior, although the coasts are hot. The site of\r\nthe city of Manila is hot, for it is on the coast and is low; but in\r\nits vicinity, quite near the city, there are districts and settlements\r\nmuch cooler, where the heat is not oppressive. The same is true of the\r\nother head of the island, opposite China, named Cagayan. The seasons\r\nof the year--winter and summer--are contrary to those in Europe; for\r\nthe rains generally last in all these islands from the month of June\r\nuntil the month of September, and are accompanied by heavy showers,\r\nwhirlwinds, and storms on sea and land. The summer lasts from October\r\nto the end of May, with clear skies and fair winds at sea. However,\r\nthe winter and rainy season begins earlier in some provinces than\r\nin others.  [215] In Cagayan winter and summer almost coincide with\r\nthose of España, and come at the same seasons.\r\n\r\nThe people inhabiting the province of Camarines and almost as far as\r\nthe provinces of Manila, in this great island of Luzon, both along\r\nthe coast and in the interior, are natives of this island. They are\r\nof medium height, with a complexion like stewed quinces; and both\r\nmen and women are well-featured. They have very black hair, and\r\nthin beards; and are very clever at anything that they undertake,\r\nkeen and passionate, and of great resolution. All live from their\r\nlabor and gains in the field, their fishing, and trade, going from\r\nisland to island by sea, and from province to province by land.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the other provinces of this island as far as Cagayan are\r\nof the same nature and disposition, except that it has been learned\r\nby tradition that those of Manila and its vicinity were not natives\r\nof this island, but came thither in the past and colonized it; and\r\nthat they are Malay natives, and come from other islands and remote\r\nprovinces. [216]\r\n\r\nIn various parts of this island of Luzon are found a number of\r\nnatives black in color. Both men and women have woolly hair, and their\r\nstature is not very great, although they are strong and robust. These\r\npeople are barbarians, and have but little capacity. They possess no\r\nfixed houses or settlements, but wander in bands and hordes through\r\nthe mountains and rough country, changing from one site to another\r\naccording to the season. They support themselves in certain clearings,\r\nand by planting rice, which they do temporarily, and by means of the\r\ngame that they bring down with their bows, in the use of which they\r\nare very skilful and certain. [217] They live also on honey from the\r\nmountains, and roots produced by the ground. They are a barbarous\r\npeople, in whom one cannot place confidence. They are much given to\r\nkilling and to attacking the settlements of the other natives, in which\r\nthey commit many depredations; and there is nothing that can be done\r\nto stop them, or to subdue or pacify them, although this is always\r\nattempted by fair or foul means, as opportunity and necessity demand.\r\n\r\nThe province of Cagayan is inhabited by natives of the same complexion\r\nas the others of the island, although they are better built, and more\r\nvaliant and warlike than the others. They wear their hair long and\r\nhanging down the back. They have been in revolt and rebellion twice\r\nsince the first time when they were pacified; and there has been plenty\r\nto do, on different occasions, in subduing them and repacifying them.\r\n\r\nThe apparel and clothing of these natives of Luzon before the\r\nentrance of the Spaniards into the country were generally, for the\r\nmen, certain short collarless garments of cangan, sewed together\r\nin the front, and with short sleeves, and reaching slightly below\r\nthe waist; some were blue and others black, while the chiefs had\r\nsome red ones, called chinanas. [218] They also wore a strip of\r\ncolored cloth wrapped about the waist, and passed between the legs,\r\nso that it covered the privy parts, reaching half-way down the thigh;\r\nthese are called bahaques. [219] They go with legs bare, feet unshod,\r\nand the head uncovered, wrapping a narrow cloth, called potong [220]\r\njust below it, with which they bind the forehead and temples. About\r\ntheir necks they wear gold necklaces, wrought like spun wax, [221]\r\nand with links in our fashion, some larger than others. On their\r\narms they wear armlets of wrought gold, which they call calombigas,\r\nand which are very large and made in different patterns. Some wear\r\nstrings of precious stones--cornelians and agates; and other blue\r\nand white stones, which they esteem highly. [222] They wear around\r\nthe legs some strings of these stones, and certain cords, covered\r\nwith black pitch in many foldings, as garters. [223]\r\n\r\nIn a province called Zambales, they wear the head shaved from\r\nthe middle forward. On the skull they have a huge lock of loose\r\nhair. [224] The women throughout this island wear small jackets\r\n[sayuelos] with sleeves of the same kinds of cloth and of all colors,\r\ncalled varos. [225] They wear no shifts, but certain white cotton\r\ngarments which are wrapped about the waist and fall to the feet,\r\nwhile other dyed cloths are wrapped about the body, like kirtles, and\r\nare very graceful. The principal women have crimson ones, and some\r\nof silk, while others are woven with gold, and adorned with fringe\r\nand other ornaments. They wear many gold necklaces about the neck,\r\ncalumbigas on the wrists, large earrings of wrought gold in the ears,\r\nand rings of gold and precious stones. Their black hair is done up\r\nin a very graceful knot on the head. Since the Spaniards came to the\r\ncountry many Indians do not wear bahaques, but wide drawers of the\r\nsame cloths and materials, and hats on their heads. The chiefs wear\r\nbraids of wrought gold containing many designs, while many of them wear\r\nshoes. The chief women also wear beautiful shoes, many of them having\r\nshoes of velvet adorned with gold, and white garments like petticoats.\r\n\r\nMen and women, and especially the chief people, are very clean and neat\r\nin their persons and clothing, and of pleasing address and grace. They\r\ndress their hair carefully, and regard it as being more ornamental when\r\nit is very black. They wash it with water in which has been boiled\r\nthe bark of a tree called gogo. [226] They anoint it with aljonjoli\r\noil, prepared with musk, and other perfumes. All are very careful of\r\ntheir teeth, which from a very early age they file and render even,\r\nwith stones and iron. [227] They dye them a black color, which is\r\nlasting, and which preserves their teeth until they are very old,\r\nalthough it is ugly to look at. [228]\r\n\r\nThey quite generally bathe the entire body in the rivers and creeks,\r\nboth young and old, without reflecting that it could at any time be\r\ninjurious to them; [229] for in their baths do they find their best\r\nmedicines. When an infant is born, they immediately bathe it, and\r\nthe mother likewise. The women have needlework as their employment\r\nand occupation, and they are very clever at it, and at all kinds of\r\nsewing. They weave cloth and spin cotton, and serve in the houses\r\nof their husbands and fathers. They pound the rice for eating,\r\n[230] and prepare the other food. They raise fowls and swine, and\r\nkeep the houses, while the men are engaged in the labors of the\r\nfield, and in their fishing, navigation, and trading. They are not\r\nvery chaste, either single or married women; while their husbands,\r\nfathers, or brothers are not very jealous or anxious about it. Both\r\nmen and women are so selfish and greedy that, if they are paid, they\r\nare easily won over. When the husband finds his wife in adultery,\r\nhe is smoothed and pacified without any trouble--although, since they\r\nhave known Spaniards, some of those who assume to be more enlightened\r\namong them have sometimes killed the adulterers. Both men and women,\r\nespecially the chiefs, walk slowly and sedately when upon their\r\nvisits, and when going through the streets and to the temples; and\r\nare accompanied by many slaves, both male and female, with parasols\r\nof silk which they carry to protect them from the sun and rain. The\r\nwomen walk ahead and their female servants and slaves follow them;\r\nbehind these walk their husbands, fathers, or brothers, with their\r\nman-servants and slaves. [231]\r\n\r\nTheir ordinary food is rice pounded in wooden mortars, and cooked--this\r\nis called morisqueta, [232] and is the ordinary bread of the whole\r\ncountry--boiled fish (which is very abundant), the flesh of swine,\r\ndeer, and wild buffaloes (which they call carabaos). Meat and fish they\r\nrelish better when it has begun to spoil and when it stinks. [233] They\r\nalso eat boiled camotes (which are sweet potatoes), beans, quilites\r\n[234] and other vegetables; all kinds of bananas, guavas, pineapples,\r\ncustard apples, many varieties of oranges, and other varieties of\r\nfruits and herbs, with which the country teems. Their drink is a wine\r\nmade from the tops of cocoa and nipa palm, of which there is a great\r\nabundance. They are grown and tended like vineyards, although without\r\nso much toil and labor. Drawing off the tuba, [235] they distil it,\r\nusing for alembics their own little furnaces and utensils, to a greater\r\nor less strength, and it becomes brandy. This is drunk throughout the\r\nislands. It is a wine of the clarity of water, but strong and dry. If\r\nit be used with moderation, it acts as a medicine for the stomach,\r\nand is a protection against humors and all sorts of rheums. Mixed\r\nwith Spanish wine, it makes a mild liquor, and one very palatable\r\nand healthful.\r\n\r\nIn the assemblies, marriages, and feasts of the natives of these\r\nislands, the chief thing consists in drinking this wine, day and night,\r\nwithout ceasing, when the turn of each comes, some singing and others\r\ndrinking. As a consequence, they generally become intoxicated without\r\nthis vice being regarded as a dishonor or disgrace. [236]\r\n\r\nThe weapons of this people are, in some provinces, bow and arrows. But\r\nthose generally used throughout the islands are moderate-sized spears\r\nwith well-made points; and certain shields of light wood, with their\r\narmholes fastened on the inside. These cover them from top to toe,\r\nand are called carasas [kalasag]. At the waist they carry a dagger four\r\nfingers in breadth, the blade pointed, and a third of a vara in length;\r\nthe hilt is of gold or ivory. The pommel is open and has two cross bars\r\nor projections, without any other guard. They are called bararaos. They\r\nhave two cutting edges, and are kept in wooden scabbards, or those\r\nof buffalo-horn, admirably wrought. [237] With these they strike\r\nwith the point, but more generally with the edge. When they go in\r\npursuit of their opponent, they show great dexterity in seizing his\r\nhair with one hand, while with the other they cut off his head with\r\none stroke of the bararao, and carry it away. They afterward keep\r\nthe heads suspended in their houses, where they may be seen; and of\r\nthese they make a display, in order to be considered as valiant, and\r\navengers of their enemies and of the injuries committed by them. [238]\r\n\r\nSince they have seen the Spaniards use their weapons, many of the\r\nnatives handle the arquebuses and muskets quite skilfully. Before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards they had bronze culverins and other pieces\r\nof cast iron, with which they defended their forts and settlements,\r\nalthough their powder is not so well refined as that of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nTheir ships and boats are of many kinds; for on the rivers and creeks\r\ninland they use certain very large canoes, each made from one log,\r\nand others fitted with benches and made from planks, and built up\r\non keels. They have vireys and barangays, which are certain quick\r\nand light vessels that lie low in the water, put together with little\r\nwooden nails. These are as slender at the stern as at the bow, and they\r\ncan hold a number of rowers on both sides, who propel their vessels\r\nwith bucçeyes or paddles, and with gaones [239] on the outside of the\r\nvessel; and they time their rowing to the accompaniment of some who\r\nsing in their language refrains by which they understand whether to\r\nhasten or retard their rowing. [240] Above the rowers is a platform or\r\ngangway, built of bamboo, upon which the fighting-men stand, in order\r\nnot to interfere with the rowing of the oarsmen. In accordance with the\r\ncapacity of the vessels is the number of men on these gangways. From\r\nthat place they manage the sail, which is square and made of linen,\r\nand hoisted on a support or yard made of two thick bamboos, which\r\nserves as a mast. When the vessel is large, it also has a foresail of\r\nthe same form. Both yards, with their tackle, can be lowered upon the\r\ngangway when the weather is rough. The helmsmen are stationed in the\r\nstern to steer. It carries another bamboo framework on the gangway\r\nitself; and upon this, when the sun shines hot, or it rains, they\r\nstretch an awning made from some mats, woven from palm-leaves. These\r\nare very bulky and close, and are called cayanes [241] Thus all the\r\nship and its crew are covered and protected. There are also other\r\nbamboo frameworks for each side of the vessel, which are so long as\r\nthe vessel, and securely fastened on. They skim the water, without\r\nhindering the rowing, and serve as a counterpoise, so that the ship\r\ncannot overturn nor upset, however heavy the sea, or strong the wind\r\nagainst the sail. It may happen that the entire hull of these vessels,\r\nwhich have no decks, may fill with water and remain between wind and\r\nwater, even until it is destroyed and broken up, without sinking,\r\nbecause of these counterpoises. These vessels have been used commonly\r\nthroughout the islands since olden times. They have other larger\r\nvessels called caracoas, lapis, and tapaques, which are used to carry\r\ntheir merchandise, and which are very suitable, as they are roomy and\r\ndraw but little water. They generally drag them ashore every night,\r\nat the mouths of rivers and creeks, among which they always navigate\r\nwithout going into the open sea or leaving the shore. All the natives\r\ncan row and manage these boats. Some are so long that they can carry\r\none hundred rowers on a side and thirty soldiers above to fight. The\r\nboats commonly used are barangays and vireys, which carry a less\r\ncrew and fighting force. Now they put many of them together with\r\niron nails instead of the wooden pegs and the joints in the planks,\r\nwhile the helms and bows have beaks like Castilian boats. [242]\r\n\r\nThe land is well shaded in all parts by trees of different kinds,\r\nand fruit-trees which beautify it throughout the year, both along\r\nthe shore and inland among the plains and mountains. It is very full\r\nof large and small rivers, of good fresh water, which flow into the\r\nsea. All of them are navigable, and abound in all kinds of fish,\r\nwhich are very pleasant to the taste. For the above reason there\r\nis a large supply of lumber, which is cut and sawed, dragged to the\r\nrivers, and brought down, by the natives. This lumber is very useful\r\nfor houses and buildings, and for the construction of small and large\r\nvessels. Many very straight thick trees, light and pliable, are found,\r\nwhich are used as masts for ships and galleons. Consequently, vessels\r\nof any size may be fitted with masts from these trees, made of one\r\npiece of timber, without its being necessary to splice them or make\r\nthem of different pieces. For the hulls of the ships, the keels,\r\nfuttock-timbers, top-timbers, and any other kinds of supports and\r\nbraces, compass-timbers, transoms, knees small and large, and rudders,\r\nall sorts of good timber are easily found; as well as good planking\r\nfor the sides, decks, and upper-works, from very suitable woods. [243]\r\n\r\nThere are many native fruit-trees, such as the sanctors, mabolos,\r\ntamarinds, nancas, custard-apples, papaws, guavas, and everywhere\r\nmany oranges, of all kinds--large and small, sweet and sour;\r\ncitrons, lemons, and ten or twelve varieties of very healthful and\r\npalatable bananas. [244] There are many cocoa-palms bearing fruit\r\nof pleasant taste--from which is made wine and common oil, which\r\nis a very healing remedy for wounds; and other wild palms of the\r\nforests--that do not yield cocoa-nuts, but serve as wood, and from\r\nwhose bark is made bonote, a tow for rigging and cables, and also for\r\ncalking ships. Efforts have been made to plant olives and quinces,\r\nand other fruit-trees of España, but as yet they have had no success,\r\nexcept with pomegranates and grapevines, which bear fruit the second\r\nyear. These bear abundance of exceedingly good grapes three times a\r\nyear; and some fig-trees have succeeded. Vegetables of every kind\r\ngrow well and very abundantly, but do not seed, and it is always\r\nnecessary to bring the seeds from Castilla, China, or Japon.\r\n\r\nIn the Cagayan provinces are found chestnut-trees, which produce\r\nfruit. In other districts are found pines and other trees which yield\r\ncertain very large pine-nuts, with a hard shell and a pleasant taste,\r\nwhich are called piles. [245] There is abundance of cedar which is\r\ncalled calanta, a beautiful red wood called asana, [246] ebony of\r\nvarious qualities, and many other precious woods for all uses. The meat\r\ngenerally eaten is that of swine, of which there is a great abundance,\r\nand it is very palatable and wholesome.\r\n\r\nBeef is eaten, cattle being raised abundantly in stock-farms in\r\nmany different parts of the islands. The cattle are bred from those\r\nof China and Nueva España. [247] The Chinese cattle are small, and\r\nexcellent breeders. Their horns are very small and twisted, and some\r\ncattle can move them. They have a large hump upon the shoulders, and\r\nare very manageable beasts. There are plenty of fowls like those of\r\nCastilla, and others very large, which are bred from fowls brought\r\nfrom China. They are very palatable, and make fine capons. Some of\r\nthese fowls are black in feather, skin, flesh, and bones, and are\r\npleasant to the taste. [248] Many geese are raised, as well as swans,\r\nducks, and tame pigeons brought from China. There is abundance of\r\nflesh of wild game, such as venison, and wild boars, and in some parts\r\nporcupines. There are many buffaloes, which are called carabaos, which\r\nare raised in the fields and are very spirited; others are brought\r\ntame from China; these are very numerous, and very handsome. These\r\nlast are used only for milking, and their milk is thicker and more\r\npalatable than that of cows.\r\n\r\nGoats and kids are raised, although their flesh is not savory, because\r\nof the humidity of the country. These animals sicken and die for that\r\nreason, and because they eat certain poisonous herbs. Ewes and rams,\r\nalthough often brought from Nueva España, never multiply. Consequently\r\nthere are none of these animals, for the climate and pasturage has not\r\nas yet seemed suitable for them. [249] There were no horses, mares, or\r\nasses in the islands, until the Spaniards had them brought from China\r\nand brought them from Nueva España. Asses and mules are very rare,\r\nbut there are many horses and mares. Some farms are being stocked with\r\nthem, and those born there (mixed breeds for the most part) turn out\r\nwell, and have good colors, are good tempered and willing to work, and\r\nare of medium size. Those brought from China are small, very strong,\r\ngood goers, treacherous, quarrelsome, and bad-tempered. Some horses\r\nof good colors are brought from Japon. They have well-shaped bodies,\r\nthick hair, large fetlocks, large legs and front hoofs, which makes\r\nthem look like draft-horses. Their heads are rather large, and their\r\nmouths hard. They run but slowly, but walk well, and are spirited,\r\nand of much mettle. The daily feed of the horses consists throughout\r\nthe year of green provender, [250] besides rice in the husk, which\r\nkeeps them very fat. [251]\r\n\r\nThere are many fowls and field birds, and wild birds of wonderful\r\ncolors and very beautiful. There are no singing birds suitable for\r\nkeeping in cages, although some calendar larks [Calandrias] called\r\nfimbaros, [252] smaller than those of España, are brought from Japon,\r\nwhose song is most sweet. There are many turtle-doves, ring-doves;\r\nother doves with an extremely green plumage, and red feet and beaks;\r\nand others that are white with a red spot on the breast, like a\r\npelican. Instead of quail, there are certain birds resembling them,\r\nbut smaller, which are called povos [253] and other smaller birds\r\ncalled mayuelas. [254] There are many wild chickens and cocks, which\r\nare very small, and taste like partridge. There are royal, white, and\r\ngrey herons, flycatchers, and other shore birds, ducks, lavancos, [255]\r\ncrested cranes, sea-crows, eagles, eagle-owls, and other birds of prey,\r\nalthough none are used for hawking. There are jays and thrushes as in\r\nEspaña, and white storks and cranes. [256] They do not rear peacocks,\r\nrabbits, or hares, although they have tried to do so. It is believed\r\nthat the wild animals in the forests and fields eat and destroy them,\r\nnamely, the cats, foxes, badgers, and large and small rats, which\r\nare very numerous, and other land animals. [257]\r\n\r\nThroughout these islands are found a great number of monkeys, of\r\nvarious sizes, with which at times the trees are covered. There are\r\ngreen and white parrots, but they are stupid in talking; and very\r\nsmall parroquets, of beautiful green and red colors, which talk as\r\nlittle. The forests and settlements have many serpents, of various\r\ncolors, which are generally larger than those of Castilla. Some\r\nhave been seen in the forests of unusual size, and wonderful to\r\nbehold. [258] The most harmful are certain slender snakes, of less\r\nthan one vara in length, which dart down upon passersby from the trees\r\n(where they generally hang), and sting them; their venom is so powerful\r\nthat within twenty-four hours the person dies raving.\r\n\r\nThere are many very large scorpions in the rivers and creeks,\r\nand a great number of crocodiles, which are very bloodthirsty and\r\ncruel. They quite commonly pull from their bancas the natives who go\r\nin those boats, and cause many injuries among the horned cattle and\r\nthe horses of the stock-farms, when they go to drink. And although the\r\npeople fish for them often and kill them, they are never diminished\r\nin number. For that reason, the natives set closely-grated divisions\r\nand enclosures in the rivers and creeks of their settlements, where\r\nthey bathe. There they enter the water to bathe, secure from those\r\nmonsters, which they fear so greatly that they venerate and adore\r\nthem, as if they were beings superior to themselves. All their oaths\r\nand execrations, and those which are of any weight with them (even\r\namong the Christians) are, thus expressed: \"So may the crocodile kill\r\nhim!\" They call the crocodile buhaya in their language. It has happened\r\nwhen some one has sworn falsely, or when he has broken his word, that\r\nthen some accident has occurred to him with the crocodile, which God,\r\nwhom he offends, has so permitted for the sake of the authority and\r\npurity of the truth, and the promise of it. [259]\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of sea and rivers are most abundant, and include all\r\nkinds of fish; both of fresh and salt water. These are generally\r\nused as food throughout the entire country. There are many good\r\nsardines, sea-eels, sea-breams (which they call bacocos), daces,\r\nskates, bicudas, tanguingues, soles, plantanos, [260] taraquitos,\r\nneedle-fish, gilt-heads, and eels; large oysters, mussels, [261]\r\nporçebes, crawfish, shrimp, sea-spiders, center-fish, and all kinds\r\nof cockles, shad, white fish, and in the Tajo River of Cagayan, [262]\r\nduring their season, a great number of bobos, which come down to spawn\r\nat the bar. In the lake of Bonbon, a quantity of tunny-fish, not so\r\nlarge as those of España, but of the same shape, flesh, and taste, are\r\ncaught. Many sea-fish are found in the sea, such as whales, sharks,\r\ncaellas, marajos, bufeos, and other unknown species of extraordinary\r\nforms and size. In the year of five hundred and ninety-six, during a\r\nfurious storm in the islands, a fish was flung into shallow water on\r\none of the Luzon coasts near the province of Camarines. It was so huge\r\nand misshapen, that although it lay in more than three and one-half\r\nbraças of water, it could not again get afloat, and died there. The\r\nnatives said that they had never seen anything like it, nor another\r\nshaped like it. Its head was of wonderful size and fierce aspect. On\r\nits frontal it bore two horns, which pointed toward its back. One of\r\nthem was taken to Manila. It was covered with its skin or hide, but\r\nhad no hair or scales. It was white, and twenty feet long. Where it\r\njoined the head it was as thick as the thigh, and gradually tapered\r\nproportionally to the tip. It was somewhat curved and not very round;\r\nand to all appearances, quite solid. It caused great wonder in all\r\nbeholders. [263]\r\n\r\nThere is a fresh-water lake in the island of Luzon, five leguas from\r\nManila, which contains a quantity of fish. Many rivers flow into this\r\nlake, and it empties into the sea through the river flowing from it\r\nto Manila. It is called La Laguna de Bay [\"Bay Lake\"]. It is thirty\r\nleguas in circumference, and has an uninhabited island in its middle,\r\nwhere game abounds. [264] Its shores are lined with many native\r\nvillages. The natives navigate the lake, and commonly cross it in\r\ntheir skiffs. At times it is quite stormy and dangerous to navigate,\r\nwhen the north winds blow, for these winds make it very boisterous,\r\nalthough it is very deep.\r\n\r\nTwenty leguas from Manila, in the province of Bonbon, is another lake\r\nof the same name [Bonbon], not so extensive as the former, but with\r\na great abundance of fish. The natives' method of catching them is\r\nby making corrals [265] of bejucos, which are certain slender canes\r\nor rushes, solid and very pliant and strong; these are employed\r\nfor making cables for the natives' boats, as well as other kinds\r\nof ropes. They catch the fish inside these corrals, having made the\r\nenclosures fast by means of stakes. They also catch the fish in wicker\r\nbaskets made from the bejucos, but most generally with atarrayas,\r\n[266] esparaveles, other small barrederas, [267] and with hand lines\r\nand hooks. [268] The most usual food of the natives is a fish as small\r\nas pejerreyes. [269] They dry and cure these fish in the sun and air,\r\nand cook them in many styles. They like them better than large fish. It\r\nis called laulau among them. [270]\r\n\r\nInstead of olives and other pickled fruit, they have a green fruit,\r\nlike walnuts, which they call paos. [271] Some are small, and others\r\nlarger in size, and when prepared they have a pleasant taste. They\r\nalso prepare charas [272] in pickle brine, and all sorts of vegetables\r\nand greens, which are very appetizing. There is much ginger, and it\r\nis eaten green, pickled, and preserved. There are also quantities of\r\ncachumba [273] instead of saffron and other condiments. The ordinary\r\ndainty throughout these islands, and in many kingdoms of the mainland\r\nof those regions, is buyo [betel]. This is made from a tree, [274]\r\nwhose leaf is shaped like that of the mulberry. The fruit resembles\r\nan oak acorn, and is white inside. [275] This fruit, which is called\r\nbonga, is cut lengthwise in strips, and each strip is put into an\r\nenvelope or covering made from the leaf. With the bonga is thrown\r\nin a powder of quick lime. [276] This compound is placed in the\r\nmouth and chewed. It is so strong a mixture, and burns so much,\r\nthat it induces sleep and intoxication. It burns the mouths of\r\nthose not used to it, and causes them to smart. The saliva and all\r\nthe mouth are made as red as blood. It does not taste bad. After\r\nhaving been chewed [277] for a considerable time it is spit out,\r\nwhen it no longer has any juice, which is called çapa [sapá]. They\r\nconsider very beneficial that quantity of the juice which has gone\r\ninto the stomach, for strengthening it, and for various diseases. It\r\nstrengthens and preserves the teeth and gums from all inflammations,\r\ndecay, and aches. They tell other wonderful effects of it. What has\r\nbeen seen is that the natives and Spaniards--laymen and religious,\r\nmen and women--use it so commonly and generally that mornings and\r\nafternoons, at parties and visits, and even alone in their houses,\r\nall their refreshments and luxuries consist of buyos served on\r\nheavily-gilded and handsomely adorned plates and trays like chocolate\r\nin Nueva España. In these poison has been often administered from\r\nwhich the persons eating them have died, and that quite commonly.\r\n\r\nThe natives (especially the chiefs) take whenever they leave their\r\nhouses, for show and entertainment, their boxes of buyos--which they\r\ncall buccetas [278]--ready to use, and the leaf, bonga, and quick lime,\r\nseparately. With these handsome boxes, which are made of metal and of\r\nother materials, they carry the scissors and other tools for making\r\nthe buyo with cleanliness and neatness. Wherever they may stop, they\r\nmake and use their buyo. In the pariáns, or bazars, buyos are sold\r\nready made, and the outfit for making them. [279]\r\n\r\nThe natives of these islands quite commonly use as venoms and poisons\r\nthe herbs of that class found throughout the islands. They are so\r\nefficacious and deadly that they produce wonderful effects. There\r\nis a lizard, commonly found in the houses, somewhat dark-green in\r\ncolor, one palmo long, and as thick as three fingers, which is called\r\nchacon. [280] They put this in a joint of bamboo, and cover it up. The\r\nslaver of this animal during its imprisonment is gathered. It is an\r\nexceedingly strong poison, when introduced as above stated, in the\r\nfood or drink, in however minute quantities. There are various herbs\r\nknown and gathered by the natives for the same use. Some of them are\r\nused dry, and others green; some are to be mixed in food, and others\r\ninhaled. Some kill by simply touching them with the hands or feet, or\r\nby sleeping upon them. The natives are so skilful in making compounds\r\nfrom these substances, that they mix and apply them in such a manner\r\nthat they take effect at once, or at a set time--long or short, as\r\nthey wish, even after a year. Many persons usually die wretchedly by\r\nthese means--especially Spaniards, who lack foresight, and who are\r\ntactless and hated because of the ill-treatment that they inflict upon\r\nthe natives with whom they deal, either in the collection of their\r\ntributes, or in other matters in which they employ them, without\r\nthere being any remedy for it. There are certain poisonous herbs,\r\nwith which, when the natives gather them, they carry, all ready, other\r\nherbs which act as antidotes. In the island of Bohol is one herb of\r\nsuch nature that the natives approach it from windward when they cut\r\nit from the shrub on which it grows; for the very air alone that blows\r\nover the herb is deadly. Nature did not leave this danger without a\r\nremedy, for other herbs and roots are found in the same islands, of\r\nso great efficacy and virtue that they destroy and correct the poison\r\nand mischief of the others, and are used when needed. Accordingly,\r\nwhen one knows what poison has been given him, it is not difficult,\r\nif recourse be had in time, to cure it, by giving the herb that is\r\nantidotal to such poison. At times it has happened that pressure has\r\nbeen put upon the person suspected of having committed the evil to\r\nmake him bring the antidote, by which it has been remedied. There are\r\nalso other general antidotes, both for preservation against poison and\r\nfor mitigating the effects of poison that has been administered. But\r\nthe most certain and efficacious antidotes are certain small flies or\r\ninsects, of a violet color, found on certain bushes in the islands\r\nof Pintados. These are shut up in a clean bamboo joint, and covered\r\nover. There they breed and multiply. Ground rice is put in with them,\r\nand they exist thereon. Every week they are visited [281] and the old\r\nrice removed and new rice put in, and they are kept alive by this\r\nmeans. If six of these insects are taken in a spoonful of wine or\r\nwater--for they emit no bad odor, and taste like cress--they produce\r\na wonderful effect. Even when people go to banquets or dinners where\r\nthere is any suspicion, they are wont to take with them these insects,\r\nin order to preserve and assure themselves from any danger of poison\r\nand venom.\r\n\r\nAll these islands are, in many districts, rich in placers and mines\r\nof gold, a metal which the natives dig and work. However, since the\r\nadvent of the Spaniards in the land, the natives proceed more slowly\r\nin this, and content themselves with what they already possess in\r\njewels and gold ingots, handed down from antiquity and inherited from\r\ntheir ancestors. [282] This is considerable, for he must be poor and\r\nwretched who has no gold chains, calombigas [bracelets], and earrings.\r\n\r\nSome placers and mines were worked at Paracali in the province of\r\nCamarines, where there is good gold mixed with copper. This commodity\r\nis also traded in the Ylocos, for at the rear of this province,\r\nwhich borders the seacoast, are certain lofty and rugged mountains\r\nwhich extend as far as Cagayan. On the slopes of these mountains,\r\nin the interior, live many natives, as yet unsubdued, and among whom\r\nno incursion has been made, who are called Ygolotes. These natives\r\npossess rich mines, many of gold and silver mixed. They are wont to\r\ndig from them only the amount necessary for their wants. They descend\r\nto certain places to trade this gold (without completing its refining\r\nor preparation), with the Ylocos; there they exchange it for rice,\r\nswine, carabaos, cloth, and other things that they need. [283] The\r\nYlocos complete its refining and preparation, and by their medium it\r\nis distributed throughout the country. Although an effort has been\r\nmade with these Ygolotes to discover their mines, and how they work\r\nthem, and their method of working the metal, nothing definite has\r\nbeen learned, for the Ygolotes fear that the Spaniards will go to\r\nseek them for their gold, and say that they keep the gold better in\r\nthe earth than in their houses. [284]\r\n\r\nThere are also many gold mines and placers in the other islands,\r\nespecially among the Pintados, on the Botuan River in Mindanao,\r\nand in Sebu, where a mine of good gold is worked, called Taribon. If\r\nthe industry and efforts of the Spaniards were to be converted into\r\nthe working of the gold, as much would be obtained from any one of\r\nthese islands as from those provinces which produce the most in the\r\nworld. But since they attend to other means of gain rather than\r\nto this, as will be told in due time, they do not pay the proper\r\nattention to this matter.\r\n\r\nIn some of these islands pearl oysters are found, especially in\r\nthe Calamianes, where some have been obtained that are large and\r\nexceedingly clear and lustrous. [285] Neither is this means of profit\r\nutilized. In all parts, seed pearls are found in the ordinary oysters,\r\nand there are oysters as large as a buckler. From the [shells of the]\r\nlatter the natives manufacture beautiful articles. There are also\r\nvery large sea turtles in all the islands. Their shells are utilized\r\nby the natives, and sold as an article of commerce to the Chinese\r\nand Portuguese, and other nations who go after them and esteem them\r\nhighly, because of the beautiful things made from them.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of any of these islands are found many small white\r\nsnail shells, called siguei. The natives gather them and sell them by\r\nmeasure to the Siamese, Cambodians, Pantanes, and other peoples of the\r\nmainland. It serves there as money, and those nations trade with it,\r\nas they do with cacao-beans in Nueva España. [286]\r\n\r\nCarabao horns are used as merchandise in trading with China; and\r\ndeerskins and dye-wood with Japon. The natives make use of everything\r\nin trading with those nations and derive much profit therefrom.\r\n\r\nIn this island of Luzon, especially in the provinces of Manila,\r\nPanpanga, Pangasinan, and Ylocos, certain earthenware jars [tibores]\r\nare found among the natives. They are very old, of a brownish color,\r\nand not handsome. Some are of medium size, and others are smaller,\r\nand they have certain marks and stamps. The natives are unable to\r\ngive any explanation of where or when they got them, for now they are\r\nnot brought to the islands or made there. The Japanese seek them and\r\nesteem them, for they have found that the root of a plant called cha\r\n[tea]--which is drunk hot, as a great refreshment and medicine, among\r\nthe kings and lords of Japon--is preserved and keeps only in these\r\ntibors. These are so highly valued throughout Japon, that they are\r\nregarded as the most precious jewels of their closets and household\r\nfurniture. A tibor is worth a great sum, and the Japanese adorn them\r\noutside with fine gold beautifully chased, and keep them in brocade\r\ncases. Some tibors are valued and sold for two thousand taes of\r\neleven reals to the tae, or for less, according to the quality of\r\nthe tibor. It makes no difference if they are cracked or chipped,\r\nfor that does not hinder them from holding the tea. The natives of\r\nthese islands sell them to the Japanese for the best price possible,\r\nand seek them carefully for this profit. However, few are found now,\r\nbecause of the assiduity with which the natives have applied themselves\r\nto that search. [287]\r\n\r\nAt times the natives have found large pieces of ambergris on the\r\ncoasts. When they discovered that the Spaniards value it, they gathered\r\nit, and have made profit from it. The past year of six hundred and\r\ntwo, some natives found in the island of Sebu a good-sized piece of\r\nambergris, and when their encomendero heard of it, he took it, and\r\ntraded with them secretly for it, on the account of their tribute. It\r\nis said that it weighed a good number of libras. Afterward he brought\r\nit out and sold it by the ounce at a higher rate. [288]\r\n\r\nIn the province and river of Butuan--which is pacified and assigned\r\nto Spaniards, and is located in the island of Mindanao--the natives\r\npractice another industry, which is very useful. As they possess\r\nmany civet cats, although smaller than those of Guinea, they make\r\nuse of the civet and trade it. This they do easily, for, when the\r\nmoon is in the crescent, they hunt the cats with nets, and capture\r\nmany of them. Then when they have obtained the civet, they loose the\r\ncats. They also capture and cage some of them, which are sold in the\r\nislands at very low prices. [289]\r\n\r\nCotton is raised abundantly throughout the islands. It is spun and\r\nsold in the skein to the Chinese and other nations, who come to\r\nget it. Cloth of different patterns is also woven from it, and the\r\nnatives also trade that. Other cloths, called medriñaques, are woven\r\nfrom the banana leaf. [290]\r\n\r\nThe islands of Babuytanes [291] consist of many small islands lying\r\noff the upper coast of the province of Cagayan. They are inhabited\r\nby natives, whose chief industry consists in going to Cagayan, in\r\ntheir tapaques, with swine, fowls, and other food, and ebony spears,\r\nfor exchange. The islands are not assigned as encomiendas, nor is\r\nany tribute collected from them. There are no Spaniards among them,\r\nas those natives are of less understanding and less civilized [than\r\nthe others]. Accordingly no Christians have been made among them,\r\nand they have no justices.\r\n\r\nOther islands, called the Catenduanes, lie off the other head of\r\nthe island of Luzon, opposite the province of Camarines, in fourteen\r\ndegrees of north latitude, near the strait of Espiritu Santo. They\r\nare islands densely populated with natives of good disposition, who\r\nare all assigned to Spaniards. They possess instruction and churches,\r\nand have an alcalde-mayor who administers justice to them. Most of\r\nthem cultivate the soil, but some are engaged in gold-washing, and\r\nin trading between various islands, and with the mainland of Luzon,\r\nvery near those islands. [292]\r\n\r\nThe island of Luzon has a bay thirty leguas in circumference on\r\nits southern coast, situated about one hundred leguas from the cape\r\nof Espiritu Santo, which is the entrance to the Capul channel. Its\r\nentrance is narrow, and midway contains an island called Miraveles\r\n[i.e., Corregidor] lying obliquely across it, which makes the\r\nentrance narrow. This island is about two leguas long and one-half\r\nlegua wide. It is high land and well shaded by its many trees. It\r\ncontains a native settlement of fifty persons, and there the watchman\r\nof the bay has his fixed abode and residence. There are channels at\r\nboth ends of the island, where one may enter the bay. The one at the\r\nsouth is one-half legua wide, and has a rock in its middle called El\r\nFraile [\"the friar\"]. The one on the north is much narrower, but any\r\nships of any draft whatever can enter and go out by both channels. The\r\nentire bay is of good depth, and clean, and has good anchorages in all\r\nparts. It is eight leguas from these entrances to the colony of Manila\r\nand the bar of the river. A large harbor is formed two leguas south\r\nof Manila, with a point of land that shelters it. That point has a\r\nnative settlement called Cabit,  [293] and it gives name to the harbor,\r\nwhich is used as a port for the vessels. It is very capacious and well\r\nsheltered from the vendavals--whether the southeast, and southwest, the\r\nwest, and west-southwest, or the north-northeast and north winds. It\r\nhas a good anchorage, with a clean and good bottom. There is a good\r\nentrance quite near the land, more than one and one-half leguas wide,\r\nfor the ingress and egress of vessels. All the shores of this bay are\r\nwell provided with abundant fisheries, of all kinds. They are densely\r\ninhabited by natives. Above Manila there is a province of more than\r\ntwenty leguas in extent called La Pampanga. This province possesses\r\nmany rivers and creeks that irrigate it. They all flow and empty\r\ninto the bay. This province contains many settlements of natives, and\r\nconsiderable quantities of rice, fruits, fish, meat, and other foods.\r\n[294]\r\n\r\nThe bar of the river of Manila, which is in the same bay, near the\r\ncolony of Manila on one side and Tondo on the other, is not very deep\r\nbecause of certain sand shoals on it, which change their position at\r\nthe time of the freshets and obstruct it. Consequently, although the\r\nwater is deep enough for any vessel past the bar, still, unless they\r\nare fragatas, vireys, or other small vessels, they cannot pass the bar\r\nto enter the river. In respect to galleys, galliots, and the vessels\r\nfrom China, which draw but little water, they must enter empty, and\r\nat high tide, and by towing. Such vessels anchor in the bay outside\r\nthe bar, and, for greater security enter the port of Cabit.\r\n\r\nThere is another good port called Ybalon, [295] twenty leguas from\r\nthe channel of the same island of Luzon, which is sheltered from the\r\nvendavals, and has a good entrance and anchorage. There the vessels\r\nthat enter to escape the vendaval find shelter, and wait until the\r\nbrisa returns, by which to go to Manila, eighty leguas away.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of Pangasinan, Ylocos, and Cagayan, there are some\r\nports and bars, where ships can enter and remain, such as the harbor\r\nof Marihuma, [296] the port E1 Frayle [\"the friar\"], [297] that of\r\nBolinao, the bar of Pangasinan, that of Bigan, the bar of Camalayuga,\r\nat the mouth of the Tajo River (which goes up two leguas to the\r\nchief settlement of Cagayan)--besides other rivers, bars, harbors,\r\nand shelters of less account for smaller vessels throughout the coasts\r\nof this island.\r\n\r\nQuite near this large island of Luzon, many other islands, large\r\nand small, are located; they are inhabited by the same natives as\r\nLuzon, who have gold placers, sowed fields, and their trading. Such\r\nare Marinduque, Tablas Island, Mazbate, Burias, Banton, Bantonillo,\r\nand others of less importance. The nearest of them to Manila is the\r\nisland of Mindoro. It is more than eighty leguas long and about two\r\nhundred in circumference. It has many settlements of the same natives,\r\nand the side lying next the provinces of Balayan and Calilaya is so\r\nnear and close to the island of Luzon, that it forms a strait which\r\ncontains powerful currents and races, through which the ships going\r\nto and from Manila enter and leave. The winds and currents there are\r\nvery strong. It is about one-half a legua wide. In that part is the\r\nchief town of this island of Mindoro. It has a port that is called El\r\nVaradero [\"the place for laying up ships\"] for large vessels. There\r\nare also other anchorages and bars throughout this island for smaller\r\nvessels; and many settlements and natives on all the coasts of this\r\nisland. All of the settlements abound in rice, food, and gold-placers,\r\nand all kinds of game and timber. [298]\r\n\r\nThe cape of Espiritu Santo, which is sighted by ships entering the\r\nFilipinas Islands on the way from Nueva España, is in an island called\r\nTendaya, [299] in about thirteen degrees. Twenty leguas south after\r\nturning this cape of Espiritu Santo lie the island of Viri, and many\r\nothers which are sighted. Through them an entrance opens to the island\r\nof Sebu by a strait called San Juanillo, which is formed by these\r\nislands. It is not very good or safe for the larger ships. But toward\r\nthe north after leaving this course, one reaches the island of Capul,\r\nwhich forms a strait and channel of many currents and rough waves,\r\nthrough which the ships enter. Before reaching the strait there is a\r\nrock, or barren islet, called San Bernardino; this strait is formed by\r\nthe coast of the island of Luzon and that of the island of Capul. Its\r\nchannel is about one legua long and less wide.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this strait, after having entered by it, three small islets\r\nform a triangle. They are called the islands of Naranjos [\"Oranges\"],\r\nand are lofty and inaccessible with steep rocks. Upon them ships are\r\nwont to be driven by the powerful currents, even though they try to\r\nescape them. These are not inhabited, but the others [Capul, Viri,\r\netc.] are large islands containing many settlements of natives and\r\nall kinds of provisions and food.\r\n\r\nSouth of this district lie the islands of Biçayas, or, as they are\r\nalso called, Pintados. They are many in number, thickly populated with\r\nnatives. Those of most renown are Leite, Ybabao, [300] Camar [Samar],\r\nBohol, island of Negros, Sebu, Panay, Cuyo, and the Calamianes. All\r\nthe natives of these islands, both men and women, are well-featured,\r\nof a good disposition, and of better nature, and more noble in their\r\nactions than the inhabitants of the islands of Luzon and its vicinity.\r\n\r\nThey differ from them in their hair, which the men wear cut in a cue,\r\nlike the ancient style in España. Their bodies are tattooed with many\r\ndesigns, but the face is not touched. [301] They wear large earrings\r\nof gold and ivory in their ears, and bracelets of the same; certain\r\nscarfs wrapped round the head, very showy, which resemble turbans,\r\nand knotted very gracefully and edged with gold. They wear also a\r\nloose collarless jacket with tight sleeves, whose skirts reach half\r\nway down the leg. These garments are fastened in front and are made\r\nof medriñaque and colored silks. They wear no shirts or drawers, but\r\nbahaques [i.e., breech-clouts] of many wrappings, which cover their\r\nprivy parts, when they remove their skirts and jackets. The women are\r\ngood-looking and graceful. They are very neat, and walk slowly. Their\r\nhair is black, long, and drawn into a knot on the head. Their robes\r\nare wrapped about the waist and fall downward. These are made of all\r\ncolors, and they wear collarless jackets of the same material. Both\r\nmen and women go naked and without any coverings, [302] and barefoot,\r\nand with many gold chains, earrings, and wrought bracelets.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons consist of large knives curved like cutlasses, spears,\r\nand caraças [i.e., shields]. They employ the same kinds of boats as\r\nthe inhabitants of Luzon. They have the same occupations, products,\r\nand means of gain as the inhabitants of all the other islands. These\r\nVisayans are a race less inclined to agriculture, and are skilful\r\nin navigation, and eager for war and raids for pillage and booty,\r\nwhich they call mangubas. [303] This means \"to go out for plunder.\"\r\n\r\nNear the principal settlement of the island of Sebu, there is a fine\r\nport for all manner of vessels. It has a good entrance and furnishes\r\nshelter at all times. It has a good bottom and is an excellent\r\nanchorage. There are also other ports and bars of less importance\r\nand consideration, as in all these islands, for smaller vessels.\r\n\r\nThis island of Sebu is an island of more than one hundred leguas in\r\ncircumference. It has abundance of provisions, and gold mines and\r\nplacers, and is inhabited by natives.\r\n\r\nBeyond it lie other islands, very pleasant and well populated,\r\nespecially the island of Panay. Panay is a large island, more\r\nthan one hundred leguas in circumference, containing many native\r\nsettlements. [304] It produces considerable quantities of rice,\r\npalm-wine, and all manner of provisions. It has flourishing and\r\nwealthy settlements, on what is called the river of Panay. The\r\nchief one is Oton, which has a bar and port for galleys and ships,\r\nshipyards for building large ships, and a great amount of timber for\r\ntheir construction. There are many natives, who are masters of all\r\nkinds of shipbuilding. Near this island lies an islet eight leguas\r\nin circumference, which is densely populated by natives who are all\r\ncarpenters. They are excellent workmen, and practice no other trade\r\nor occupation; and, without a single tree of any size on this whole\r\nislet, they practice this art with great ability. From there all the\r\nislands are furnished with workmen for carpentry. The island is called\r\nthat of the Cagayanes.\r\n\r\nAfter the island of Sebu follow immediately the island of Mindanao,\r\nan island of more than three hundred leguas in circumference, and\r\nJoló, which is small. Lower down is the island of Borneo, a very\r\nlarge island, more than five hundred leguas in circumference. All of\r\nthese islands are densely populated, although that of Borneo is not\r\nsubdued. Neither is that of Mindanao in entirety, but only the river\r\nof Botuan, Dapitan, and the province and coast of Caragan.\r\n\r\nBelow this island [Mindanao], before reaching that of Borneo, lie\r\nthe islands of the Calamianes. They are very numerous, and consist of\r\nislands of various sizes, which are densely inhabited with natives;\r\nthey have some supply of provisions and engage in certain kinds\r\nof husbandry. However the most usual occupation is that of their\r\nnavigations from island to island in pursuit of their trading and\r\nexchange, and their fisheries; while those who live nearest the island\r\nof Borneo are wont to go on piratical raids and pillage the natives\r\nin other islands.\r\n\r\nThe flow- and ebb-tides, and the high and low tides among these\r\nislands are so diverse in them that they have no fixed rule,\r\neither because of the powerful currents among these islands, or\r\nby some other natural secret of the flux and reflux which the moon\r\ncauses. No definite knowledge has been arrived at in this regard,\r\nfor although the tides are highest during the opposition of the moon,\r\nand are higher in the month of March than throughout the rest of the\r\nyear, there is so great variation in the daily tides that it causes\r\nsurprise. Some days there are two equal tides between day and night,\r\nwhile other days there is but one. At other times the flow during the\r\nday is low, and that of the night greater. They usually have no fixed\r\nhour, for it may happen to be high-tide one day at noon, while next day\r\nhigh-tide may be anticipated or postponed many hours. Or the tide of\r\none day may be low, and when a smaller one is expected for next day,\r\nit may be much greater.\r\n\r\nThe language of all the Pintados and Biçayas is one and the same,\r\nby which they understand one another when talking, or when writing\r\nwith the letters and characters of their own which they possess. These\r\nresemble those of the Arabs. The common manner of writing among the\r\nnatives is on leaves of trees, and on bamboo bark. Throughout the\r\nislands the bamboo is abundant; it has huge and misshapen joints,\r\nand lower part is a very thick and solid tree. [305]\r\n\r\nThe language of Luzon and those islands in its vicinity differs widely\r\nfrom that of the Bicayas. [306] The language of the island of Luzon\r\nis not uniform, for the Cagayans have one language and the Ylocos\r\nanother. The Zambales have their own particular language, while the\r\nPampangos also have one different from the others. The inhabitants of\r\nthe province of Manila, the Tagáls, have their own language, which\r\nis very rich and copious. By means of it one can express elegantly\r\nwhatever he wishes, and in many modes and manners. It is not difficult,\r\neither to learn or to pronounce.\r\n\r\nThe natives throughout the islands can write excellently with certain\r\ncharacters, almost like the Greek or Arabic. These characters are\r\nfifteen in all. Three are vowels, which are used as are our five. The\r\nconsonants number twelve, and each and all of them combine with\r\ncertain dots or commas, and so signify whatever one wishes to write,\r\nas fluently and easily as is done with our Spanish alphabet. The method\r\nof writing was on bamboo, but is now on paper, commencing the lines\r\nat the right and running to the left, in the Arabic fashion. Almost\r\nall the natives, both men and women, write in this language. There\r\nare very few who do not write it excellently and correctly.\r\n\r\nThis language of the province of Manila [i.e., the Tagál] extends\r\nthroughout the province of Camarines, and other islands not contiguous\r\nto Luzon. There is but little difference in that spoken in the various\r\ndistricts, except that it is spoken more elegantly in some provinces\r\nthan in others. [307]\r\n\r\nThe edifices and houses of the natives of all these Filipinas\r\nIslands are built in a uniform manner, as are their settlements;\r\nfor they always build them on the shores of the sea, between rivers\r\nand creeks. The natives generally gather in districts or settlements\r\nwhere they sow their rice, and possess their palm trees, nipa and\r\nbanana groves, and other trees, and implements for their fishing\r\nand sailing. A small number inhabit the interior, and are called\r\ntinguianes; they also seek sites on rivers and creeks, on which they\r\nsettle for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nThe houses and dwellings of all these natives are universally set\r\nupon stakes and arigues [i.e., columns] high above the ground. Their\r\nrooms are small and the roofs low. They are built and tiled with wood\r\nand bamboos, [308] and covered and roofed with nipa-palm leaves. Each\r\nhouse is separate, and is not built adjoining another. In the lower\r\npart are enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls\r\nand cattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends\r\ninto the houses by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which are\r\nmade from two bamboos. Above are their open batalanes [galleries]\r\nused for household duties; the parents and [grown] children live\r\ntogether. There is little adornment and finery in the houses, which\r\nare called bahandin. [309]\r\n\r\nBesides these houses, which are those of the common people and those\r\nof less importance, there are the chiefs' houses. They are built\r\nupon trees and thick arigues, with many rooms and comforts. They are\r\nwell constructed of timber and planks, and are strong and large. They\r\nare furnished and supplied with all that is necessary, and are much\r\nfiner and more substantial than the others. They are roofed, however,\r\nas are the others, with the palm-leaves called nipa. These keep out\r\nthe water and the sun more than do shingles or tiles, although the\r\ndanger from fires is greater.\r\n\r\nThe natives do not inhabit the lower part of their houses, because\r\nthey raise their fowls and cattle there, and because of the damp\r\nand heat of the earth, and the many rats, which are enormous and\r\ndestructive both in the houses and sowed fields; and because, as\r\ntheir houses are generally built on the sea shore, or on the banks of\r\nrivers and creeks, the waters bathe the lower parts, and the latter\r\nare consequently left open.\r\n\r\nThere were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over\r\nthem as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces; but in every\r\nisland, and in each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by\r\nthe natives themselves. Some were more powerful than others, and\r\neach one had his followers and subjects, by districts and families;\r\nand these obeyed and respected the chief. Some chiefs had friendship\r\nand communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels. [310]\r\n\r\nThese principalities and lordships were inherited in the male\r\nline and by succession of father and son and their descendants. If\r\nthese were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives\r\nsucceeded. Their duty was to rule and govern their subjects and\r\nfollowers, and to assist them in their interests and necessities. What\r\nthe chiefs received from their followers was to be held by them in\r\ngreat veneration and respect; and they were served in their wars and\r\nvoyages, and in their tilling, sowing, fishing, and the building of\r\ntheir houses. To these duties the natives attended very promptly,\r\nwhenever summoned by their chief. They also paid the chiefs tribute\r\n(which they called buiz), in varying quantities, in the crops that\r\nthey gathered. The descendants of such chiefs, and their relatives,\r\neven though they did not inherit the lordship, were held in the\r\nsame respect and consideration. Such were all regarded as nobles,\r\nand as persons exempt from the services rendered by the others,\r\nor the plebeians, who were called timaguas. [311] The same right of\r\nnobility and chieftainship was preserved for the women, just as for\r\nthe men. When any of these chiefs was more courageous than others\r\nin war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers\r\nand men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they\r\nwere chiefs. These latter retained to themselves the lordship and\r\nparticular government of their own following, which is called barangai\r\namong them. They had datos and other special leaders [mandadores]\r\nwho attended to the interests of the barangay.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of these chiefs over those of their barangai was so\r\ngreat that they held the latter as subjects; they treated these well\r\nor ill, and disposed of their persons, their children, and their\r\npossessions, at will, without any resistance, or rendering account\r\nto anyone. For very slight annoyances and for slight occasions, they\r\nwere wont to kill and wound them, and to enslave them. It has happened\r\nthat the chiefs have made perpetual slaves of persons who have gone\r\nby them, while bathing in the river, or who have raised their eyes\r\nto look at them less respectfully and for other similar causes. [312]\r\n\r\nWhen some natives had suits or disputes with others over matters of\r\nproperty and interest, or over personal injuries and wrongs received,\r\nthey appointed old men of the same district, to try them, the parties\r\nbeing present. If they had to present proofs, they brought their\r\nwitnesses there, and the case was immediately judged according to\r\nwhat was found, according to the usages of their ancestors on like\r\noccasions; and that sentence was observed and executed without any\r\nfurther objection or delay. [313]\r\n\r\nThe natives' laws throughout the islands were made in the same manner,\r\nand they followed the traditions and customs of their ancestors,\r\nwithout anything being written. Some provinces had different customs\r\nthan others in some respects. However, they agreed in most, and in\r\nall the islands generally the same usages were followed. [314]\r\n\r\nThere are three conditions of persons among the natives of these\r\nislands, and into which their government is divided: the chiefs,\r\nof whom we have already treated; the timaguas, who are equivalent to\r\nplebeians; and slaves, those of both chiefs and timaguas.\r\n\r\nThe slaves were of several classes. Some were for all kinds of work\r\nand slavery, like those which we ourselves hold. Such are called\r\nsaguiguilires; [315] they served inside the house, as did likewise the\r\nchildren born of them. There are others who live in their own houses\r\nwith their families, outside the house of their lord; and come, at the\r\nseason, to aid him in his sowings and harvests, among his rowers when\r\nhe embarks, in the construction of his house when it is being built,\r\nand to serve in his house when there are guests of distinction. These\r\nare bound to come to their lord's house whenever he summons them, and\r\nto serve in these offices without any pay or stipend. These slaves are\r\ncalled namamahays, [316] and their children and descendants are slaves\r\nof the same class. From these slaves--saguiguilirs and namamahays--are\r\nissue, some of whom are whole slaves, some of whom are half slaves,\r\nand still others one-fourth slaves. It happens thus: if either the\r\nfather or the mother was free, and they had an only child, he was\r\nhalf free and half slave. If they had more than one child, they were\r\ndivided as follows: the first follows the condition of the father,\r\nfree or slave; the second that of the mother. If there were an odd\r\nnumber of children, the last was half free and half slave. Those who\r\ndescended from these, if children of a free mother or father, were\r\nonly one-fourth slaves, because of being children of a free father or\r\nmother and of a half-slave. These half slaves or one-fourth slaves,\r\nwhether saguiguilirs or namamahays, served their masters during every\r\nother moon; and in this respect so is such condition slavery.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it may happen in divisions between heirs that a slave\r\nwill fall to several, and serves each one for the time that is due\r\nhim. When the slave is not wholly slave, but half or fourth, he has\r\nthe right, because of that part that is free, to compel his master to\r\nemancipate him for a just price. This price is appraised and regulated\r\nfor persons according to the quality of their slavery, whether it be\r\nsaguiguilir or namamahay, half slave or quarter slave. But, if he is\r\nwholly slave, the master cannot be compelled to ransom or emancipate\r\nhim for any price.\r\n\r\nThe usual price of a sanguiguilir slave among the natives is, at most,\r\ngenerally ten taes of good gold, or eighty pesos; if he is namamahay,\r\nhalf of that sum. The others are in the same proportion, taking into\r\nconsideration the person and his age.\r\n\r\nNo fixed beginning can be assigned as the origin of these kinds of\r\nslavery among these natives, because all the slaves are natives of\r\nthe islands, and not strangers. It is thought that they were made in\r\ntheir wars and quarrels. The most certain knowledge is that the most\r\npowerful made the others slaves, and seized them for slight cause or\r\noccasion, and many times for loans and usurious contracts which were\r\ncurrent among them. The interest, capital, and debt, increased so much\r\nwith delay that the borrowers became slaves. Consequently all these\r\nslaveries have violent and unjust beginnings; and most of the suits\r\namong the natives are over these, and they occupy the judges in the\r\nexterior court with them, and their confessors in that of conscience.\r\n[317]\r\n\r\nThese slaves comprise the greatest wealth and capital of the natives\r\nof these islands, for they are very useful to them and necessary\r\nfor the cultivation of their property. They are sold, traded, and\r\nexchanged among them, just as any other mercantile article, from one\r\nvillage to another, from one province to another, and likewise from\r\none island to another. Therefore, and to avoid so many suits as would\r\noccur if these slaveries were examined, and their origin and source\r\nascertained, they are preserved and held as they were formerly.\r\n\r\nThe marriages of these natives, commonly and generally were, and\r\nare: Chiefs with women chiefs; timaguas with those of that rank; and\r\nslaves with those of their own class. But sometimes these classes\r\nintermarry with one another. They considered one woman, whom they\r\nmarried, as the legitimate wife and the mistress of the house;\r\nand she was styled ynasaba. [318] Those whom they kept besides her\r\nthey considered as friends. The children of the first were regarded\r\nas legitimate and whole heirs of their parents; the children of the\r\nothers were not so regarded, and were left something by assignment,\r\nbut they did not inherit.\r\n\r\nThe dowry was furnished by the man, being given by his parents. The\r\nwife furnished nothing for the marriage, until she had inherited\r\nit from her parents. The solemnity of the marriage consisted in\r\nnothing more than the agreement between the parents and relatives of\r\nthe contracting parties, the payment of the dowry agreed upon to the\r\nfather of the bride, [319] and the assembling at the wife's parents'\r\nhouse of all the relatives to eat and drink until they would fall\r\ndown. At night the man took the woman to his house and into his\r\npower, and there she remained. These marriages were annulled and\r\ndissolved for slight cause, with the examination and judgment of the\r\nrelatives of both parties, and of the old men, who acted as mediators\r\nin the affairs. At such a time the man took the dowry (which they call\r\nvigadicaya), [320] unless it happened that they separated through the\r\nhusband's fault; for then it was not returned to him, and the wife's\r\nparents kept it. The property that they had acquired together was\r\ndivided into halves, and each one disposed of his own. If one made\r\nany profits in which the other did not have a share or participate,\r\nhe acquired it for himself alone.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were adopted one by another, in presence of the\r\nrelatives. The adopted person gave and delivered all his actual\r\npossessions to the one who adopted him. Thereupon he remained\r\nin his house and care, and had a right to inherit with the other\r\nchildren. [321]\r\n\r\nAdulteries were not punishable corporally. If the adulterer paid the\r\naggrieved party the amount adjudged by the old men and agreed upon\r\nby them, then the injury was pardoned, and the husband was appeased\r\nand retained his honor. He would still live with his wife and there\r\nwould be no further talk about the matter.\r\n\r\nIn inheritances all the legitimate children inherited equally from\r\ntheir parents whatever property they had acquired. If there were any\r\nmovable or landed property which they had received from their parents,\r\nsuch went to the nearest relatives and the collateral side of that\r\nstock, if there were no legitimate children by an ynasaba. This was\r\nthe case either with or without a will. In the act of drawing a will,\r\nthere was no further ceremony than to have written it or to have\r\nstated it orally before acquaintances.\r\n\r\nIf any chief was lord of a barangai, then in that case, the eldest son\r\nof an ynasaba succeeded him. If he died, the second son succeeded. If\r\nthere were no sons, then the daughters succeeded in the same order. If\r\nthere were no legitimate successors, the succession went to the\r\nnearest relative belonging to the lineage and relationship of the\r\nchief who had been the last possessor of it.\r\n\r\nIf any native who had slave women made concubines of any of them,\r\nand such slave woman had children, those children were free, as was\r\nthe slave. But if she had no children, she remained a slave. [322]\r\n\r\nThese children by a slave woman, and those borne by a married woman,\r\nwere regarded as illegitimate, and did not succeed to the inheritance\r\nwith the other children, neither were the parents obliged to leave\r\nthem anything. Even if they were the sons of chiefs, they did not\r\nsucceed to the nobility or chieftainship of the parents, nor to their\r\nprivileges, but they remained and were reckoned as plebeians and in\r\nthe number and rank of the other timaguas.\r\n\r\nThe contracts and negotiations of these natives were generally illegal,\r\neach one paying attention to how he might better his own business\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nLoans with interest were very common and much practiced, and the\r\ninterest incurred was excessive. The debt doubled and increased all\r\nthe time while payment was delayed, until it stripped the debtor of\r\nall his possessions, and he and his children, when all their property\r\nwas gone, became slaves. [323]\r\n\r\nTheir customary method of trading was by bartering one thing for\r\nanother, such as food, cloth, cattle, fowls, lands, houses, fields,\r\nslaves, fishing-grounds, and palm-trees (both nipa and wild). Sometimes\r\na price intervened, which was paid in gold, as agreed upon, or in metal\r\nbells brought from China. These bells they regard as precious jewels;\r\nthey resemble large pans and are very sonorous. [324] They play upon\r\nthese at their feasts, and carry them to the war in their boats instead\r\nof drums and other instruments. There are often delays and terms for\r\ncertain payments, and bondsmen who intervene and bind themselves,\r\nbut always with very usurious and excessive profits and interests.\r\n\r\nCrimes were punished by request of the aggrieved parties. Especially\r\nwere thefts punished with greater severity, the robbers being enslaved\r\nor sometimes put to death. [325] The same was true of insulting words,\r\nespecially when spoken to chiefs. They had among themselves many\r\nexpressions and words which they regarded as the highest insult,\r\nwhen said to men and women. These were pardoned less willingly and\r\nwith greater difficulty than was personal violence, such as wounding\r\nand assaulting. [326]\r\n\r\nConcubinage, rape, and incest, were not regarded at all, unless\r\ncommitted by a timagua on the person of a woman chief. It was\r\na quite ordinary practice for a married man to have lived a long\r\ntime in concubinage with the sister of his wife. Even before having\r\ncommunication with his wife he could have had access for a long\r\ntime to his mother-in-law, especially if the bride were very young,\r\nand until she were of sufficient age. This was done in sight of all\r\nthe relatives.\r\n\r\nSingle men are called bagontaos, [327] and girls of marriageable age,\r\ndalagas. Both classes are people of little restraint, and from early\r\nchildhood they have communication with one another, and mingle with\r\nfacility and little secrecy, and without this being regarded among\r\nthe natives as a cause for anger. Neither do the parents, brothers,\r\nor relatives, show any anger, especially if there is any material\r\ninterest in it, and but little is sufficient with each and all.\r\n\r\nAs long as these natives lived in their paganism, it was not known\r\nthat they had fallen into the abominable sin against nature. But after\r\nthe Spaniards had entered their country, through communication with\r\nthem--and still more, through that with the Sangleys, who have come\r\nfrom China, and are much given to that vice--it has been communicated\r\nto them somewhat, both to men and to women. In this matter it has\r\nbeen necessary to take action.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the islands of Pintados, especially the women, are very\r\nvicious and sensual. Their perverseness has discovered lascivious\r\nmethods of communication between men and women; and there is one to\r\nwhich they are accustomed from their youth. The men skilfully make\r\na hole in their virile member near its head, and insert therein a\r\nserpent's head, either of metal or ivory, and fasten it with a peg of\r\nthe same material passed through the hole, so that it cannot become\r\nunfastened. With this device, they have communication with their wives,\r\nand are unable to withdraw until a long time after copulation. They are\r\nvery fond of this and receive much pleasure from it, so that, although\r\nthey shed a quantity of blood, and receive other harm, it is current\r\namong them. These devices are called sagras, and there are very few\r\nof them, because since they have become Christians, strenuous efforts\r\nare being made to do away with these, and not consent to their use;\r\nand consequently the practice has been checked in great part. [328]\r\n\r\nHerbalists and witches are common among these natives, but are not\r\npunished or prohibited among them, so long as they do not cause any\r\nspecial harm. But seldom could that be ascertained or known.\r\n\r\nThere were also men whose business was to ravish and take away\r\nvirginity from young girls. These girls were taken to such men, and\r\nthe latter were paid for ravishing them, for the natives considered it\r\na hindrance and impediment if the girls were virgins when they married.\r\n\r\nIn matters of religion, the natives proceeded more barbarously and\r\nwith greater blindness than in all the rest. For besides being pagans,\r\nwithout any knowledge of the true God, they neither strove to discover\r\nHim by way of reason, nor had any fixed belief. The devil usually\r\ndeceived them with a thousand errors and blindnesses. He appeared to\r\nthem in various horrible and frightful forms, and as fierce animals,\r\nso that they feared him and trembled before him. They generally\r\nworshiped him, and made images of him in the said forms. These they\r\nkept in caves and private houses, where they offered them perfumes\r\nand odors, and food and fruit, calling them anitos. [329]\r\n\r\nOthers worshiped the sun and the moon, and made feasts and\r\ndrunken revels at the conjunction of those bodies. Some worshiped a\r\nyellow-colored bird that dwells in their woods, called batala. They\r\ngenerally worship and adore the crocodiles when they see them, by\r\nkneeling down and clasping their hands, because of the harm that\r\nthey receive from those reptiles; they believe that by so doing\r\nthe crocodiles will become appeased and leave them. Their oaths,\r\nexecrations, and promises are all as above mentioned, namely, \"May\r\nbuhayan eat thee, if thou dost not speak truth, or fulfil what thou\r\nhast promised,\" and similar things.\r\n\r\nThere were no temples throughout those islands, nor houses generally\r\nused for the worship of idols; but each person possessed and\r\nmade in his house his own anitos, [330] without any fixed rite or\r\nceremony. They had no priests or religious to attend to religious\r\naffairs, except certain old men and women called catalonas. These\r\nwere experienced witches and sorcerers, who kept the other people\r\ndeceived. The latter communicated to these sorcerers their desires\r\nand needs, and the catalonas told them innumerable extravagancies and\r\nlies. The catalonas uttered prayers and performed other ceremonies to\r\nthe idols for the sick; and they believed in omens and superstitions,\r\nwith which the devil inspired them, whereby they declared whether the\r\npatient would recover or die. Such were their cures and methods, and\r\nthey used various kinds of divinations for all things. All this was\r\nwith so little aid, apparatus, or foundation--which God permitted, so\r\nthat the preaching of the holy gospel should find those of that region\r\nbetter prepared for it, and so that those natives would confess the\r\ntruth more easily, and it would be less difficult to withdraw them\r\nfrom their darkness, and the errors in which the devil kept them for\r\nso many years. They never sacrificed human beings as is done in other\r\nkingdoms. They believed that there was a future life where those\r\nwho had been brave and performed valiant feats would be rewarded;\r\nwhile those who had done evil would be punished. But they did not\r\nknow how or where this would be. [331]\r\n\r\nThey buried their dead in their own houses, and kept their bodies\r\nand bones for a long time in chests. They venerated the skulls of the\r\ndead as if they were living and present. Their funeral rites did not\r\nconsist of pomp or assemblages, beyond those of their own house--where,\r\nafter bewailing the dead, all was changed into feasting and drunken\r\nrevelry among all the relatives and friends. [332]\r\n\r\nA few years before the Spaniards subdued the island of Luzon,\r\ncertain natives of the island of Borneo began to go thither to trade,\r\nespecially to the settlement of Manila and Tondo; and the inhabitants\r\nof the one island intermarried with those of the other. These Borneans\r\nare Mahometans, and were already introducing their religion among\r\nthe natives of Luzon, and were giving them instructions, ceremonies,\r\nand the form of observing their religion, by means of certain gazizes\r\n[333] whom they brought with them. Already a considerable number,\r\nand those the chiefest men, were commencing, although by piecemeal,\r\nto become Moros, and were being circumcised [334] and taking the names\r\nof Moros. Had the Spaniards' coming been delayed longer, that religion\r\nwould have spread throughout the island, and even through the others,\r\nand it would have been difficult to extirpate it. The mercy of God\r\nchecked it in time; for, because of being in so early stages, it was\r\nuprooted from the islands, and they were freed from it, that is, in all\r\nthat the Spaniards have pacified, and that are under the government of\r\nthe Filipinas. That religion has spread and extended very widely in\r\nthe other islands outside of this government, so that now almost all\r\nof their natives are Mahometan Moros, and are ruled and instructed by\r\ntheir gaçizes and other morabitos; [335] these often come to preach\r\nto and teach them by way of the strait of Ma[la]ca and the Red Sea,\r\nthrough which they navigate to reach these islands.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Spaniards in these Filipinas Islands, since the\r\nyear one thousand five hundred and sixty-four, the pacification and\r\nconversion that has been made therein, their mode of governing, and\r\nthe provisions of his Majesty during these years for their welfare,\r\nhave caused innovations in many things, such as are usual to kingdoms\r\nand provinces that change their religion and sovereign. The foremost\r\nhas been that, besides the name of Filipinas which all the islands\r\ntook and received from the beginning of their conquest, they belong\r\nto a new kingdom and seigniory to which his Majesty, Filipo Second,\r\nour sovereign, gave the name of Nuevo Reyno de Castilla [\"New Kingdom\r\nof Castilla\"]. By his royal concession, he made the city of Manila\r\ncapital of it, and gave to it as a special favor, among other things,\r\na crowned coat-of-arms which was chosen and assigned by his royal\r\nperson. This is an escutcheon divided across. In the upper part is a\r\ncastle on a red field, and in the lower a lion of gold, crowned and\r\nrampant, holding a naked sword in its right paw. One-half of the body\r\nis in the form of a dolphin upon the waters of the sea, to signify\r\nthat the Spaniards crossed the sea with their arms to conquer this\r\nkingdom for the crown of Castilla. [336]\r\n\r\nThe city of Manila was founded by the adelantado Miguel Lopez de\r\nLegazpi, first governor of the Filipinas, in the island of Luzon. It\r\noccupies the same site where Rajamora had his settlement and fort--as\r\nhas been related more at length--at the mouth of the river which\r\nempties into the bay, on a point between the river and the sea. The\r\nwhole site was occupied by this new settlement, and Legazpi apportioned\r\nit to the Spaniards in equal building-lots. It was laid out with\r\nwell-arranged streets and squares, straight and level. A sufficiently\r\nlarge main square [Plaza mayor] was left, fronting which were erected\r\nthe cathedral church and municipal buildings. He left another square,\r\nthat of arms [Plaza de armas], fronting which was built the fort, as\r\nwell as the royal buildings. He gave sites for the monasteries, [337]\r\nhospital, and chapels which were to be built, as being a city which\r\nwas to grow and increase continually--as already it has done; for,\r\nin the course of the time that has passed, that city has flourished\r\nas much as the best of all the cities in those regions.\r\n\r\nThe city is completely surrounded with a stone wall, which is more\r\nthan two and one-half varas wide, and in places more than three. It\r\nhas small towers and traverses at intervals.  [338] It has a fortress\r\nof hewn stone at the point that guards the bar and the river, with a\r\nravelin close to the water, upon which are mounted some large pieces\r\nof artillery. This artillery commands the sea and river, while other\r\npieces are mounted farther up to defend the bar, besides some other\r\nmoderate-sized field-pieces and swivel-guns. These fortifications\r\nhave their vaults for storing supplies and munitions, and a magazine\r\nfor the powder, which is well guarded and situated in the inner\r\npart; and a copious well of fresh water. There are also quarters\r\nfor the soldiers and artillerymen, and the house of the commandant\r\n[alcayde]. The city has been lately fortified on the land side at the\r\nPlaza de armas, where it is entered by a strong wall and two salient\r\ntowers, defended with artillery, which command the wall and gate. This\r\nfortress is called Santiago, and has a company of thirty soldiers\r\nwith their officers, and eight artillerymen who guard the gate and\r\nentrance by watches--all in charge of a commandant who lives inside,\r\nand has the guard and custody of the fort.\r\n\r\nThere is another fortress, also of stone, in the same wall, within\r\nculverin range, located at the end [339] of the curtain, which extends\r\nalong the shore of the bay. It is called Nuestra Señora de Guia, and\r\nis a very large round tower. It has its own court, well, and quarters\r\ninside, as well as the magazine, and other rooms for work. It has a\r\ntraverse extending to the beach, on which are mounted a dozen large and\r\nmoderate-sized pieces, which command the bay and sweep the wall, which\r\nextends along the shore to the gate and to the fort of Santiago. On\r\nthe other side the fortress has a large salient tower, mounted with\r\nfour large pieces, which command the shore ahead in the direction of\r\nthe chapel of Nuestra Señora de Guia. The gate and entrance is within\r\nthe city and is guarded by a company of twenty soldiers and their\r\nofficers, six artillerymen, and one commandant and his lieutenant,\r\nwho live inside.\r\n\r\nOn the land side, where the wall extends, there is a rampart called\r\nSant Andres, which mounts six pieces of artillery that command in\r\nall directions, and some swivel-guns. Farther on is another traverse\r\ncalled San Gabriel, opposite the parián of the Sangleys, with a like\r\namount of artillery. Both have some soldiers and an ordinary guard.\r\n\r\nThe wall has a sufficient height, and is furnished with battlements and\r\nturrets, built in the modern style, for its defense. It has a circuit\r\nof about one legua, which can be made entirely on top. It has many\r\nbroad steps of the same hewn stone, at intervals inside. There are\r\nthree principal city gates on the land side, and many other posterns\r\nopening at convenient places on the river and beach, for the service\r\nof the city. Each and all of them are locked before nightfall by\r\nthe ordinary patrols. These carry the keys to the guard-room of the\r\nroyal buildings. In the morning when day comes, the patrols return\r\nwith the keys and open the city. [340]\r\n\r\nThe royal arsenals front on the Plaza de armas. In them are kept and\r\nguarded all the supplies of ammunition, food, rigging, iron, copper,\r\nlead, artillery, arquebuses, and other things belonging to the royal\r\nestate. They have their own officers and workmen, and are placed in\r\ncharge of the royal officials.\r\n\r\nNear these arsenals is located the powder-house, with its master,\r\nworkmen, and convicts, where powder is generally ground in thirty\r\nmortars, and that which is spoiled is refined. [341]\r\n\r\nThe building for the founding of artillery is located on a suitable\r\nsite in another part of the city. It has its molds, ovens, and tools,\r\nfounders, and workmen who work it. [342]\r\n\r\nThe royal buildings are very beautiful and sightly, and contain many\r\nrooms. They have many windows opening toward the sea and the Plaza\r\nde armas. They are all built of stone and have two courts, with\r\nupper and lower galleries raised on stout pillars. The governor and\r\npresident lives inside with his family. There is a hall for the royal\r\nAudiencia, which is very large and stately; also a separate chapel,\r\na room for the royal seal, [343] and offices for the scriveners of the\r\nAudiencia, and the government. There are also other apartments for the\r\nroyal treasury and the administration of the royal officials, while a\r\nlarge porch opens on the street with two principal doors, where the\r\nguardroom is located. There is one company of regular arquebusiers,\r\nwho come in daily with their banners to stand guard. Opposite, on the\r\nother side of the street, is another edifice for the royal treasury\r\nand those in charge of it. [344]\r\n\r\nThe houses of the cabildo, located on the square, are built of\r\nstone. They are very sightly and have handsome halls. On the ground\r\nfloor is the prison, and the court of the alcaldes-in-ordinary. [345]\r\n\r\nOn the same square is situated the cathedral church. It is built\r\nof hewn stone, and has three naves, and its main chapel, and choir,\r\nwith high and low seats. The choir is shut in by railings, and has\r\nits organ, missal-stands, and other necessary things. The cathedral\r\nhas also its sacristan [346] and his apartments and offices.\r\n\r\nWithin the city is the monastery of St. Augustine. It is very large\r\nand has many dormitories, a refectory and kitchens. They are now\r\ncompleting a church, which is one of the most sumptuous in those\r\ndistricts. This convent has generally fifty religious. [347]\r\n\r\nThe monastery of St. Dominic is inside the walls. It contains\r\nabout forty religious. It was built of stone, and was very well\r\nconstructed. It has a church, house, and all offices. It has lately\r\nbeen rebuilt, and much better; for it was completely destroyed in\r\nthe burning of the city in the year six hundred and three.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of St. Francis is farther on. It is well constructed\r\nof stone, and its church is being rebuilt. It contains about forty\r\ndiscalced religious.\r\n\r\nThe residence [colegio] of the Society of Jesus is established near\r\nthe fortress of Nuestra Señora de Guia. It contains twenty religious\r\nof their order, and is an excellent stone house and church. There\r\nthey study Latin, the arts, and cases of conscience. Connected with\r\nthem is a seminary and convictorio [348] for Spanish scholars, with\r\ntheir rector. These students wear gowns of tawny-colored frieze with\r\nred facings. [349]\r\n\r\nIn another part of the city stands a handsome house, walled in, with\r\nits stone church, called San Andres and Santa Potenciana. It is a royal\r\nfoundation, and a rectoress lives there. It has a revolving entrance\r\nand a parlor, and the rectoress has other confidential assistants;\r\nand there shelter is given to needy women and girls of the city,\r\nin the form of religious retirement. Some of the girls leave the\r\nhouse to be married, while others remain there permanently. It has\r\nits own house for work, and its choir. His Majesty assists them with\r\na portion of their maintenance; the rest is provided by their own\r\nindustry and property. They have their own steward and their priest,\r\nwho administers the sacraments to them. [350]\r\n\r\nIn another part is the royal hospital for Spaniards, with its\r\nphysician, apothecary, surgeons, managers, and servants. It and its\r\nchurch are built of stone; and it has its sick rooms and the bed\r\nservice. In it all the Spaniards are treated. It is usually quite\r\nfull; it is under the royal patronage. His Majesty provides the most\r\nnecessary things for it. Three discalced religious of St. Francis\r\nact there as superintendents, and they prove very advantageous for\r\nthe corporal and spiritual relief of the sick. It was burned in the\r\nconflagration of the former year six hundred and three, and is now\r\nbeing rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThere is another charitable hospital in charge of the Confraternity of\r\nthat name. It was founded in the city of Manila by the Confraternity\r\nof La Misericordia of Lisboa, and by the other confraternities of\r\nIndia. [351] It has apostolic bulls for works of charity, such as\r\nburying the dead, supporting the modest poor, marrying orphans, and\r\nrelieving many necessities. There the slaves of the city are treated,\r\nand lodgings are likewise provided for poor women.\r\n\r\nNext to the monastery of St. Francis is located the hospital for\r\nnatives, [352] which is under royal patronage. It was founded with\r\nalms, by a holy lay-brother of St. Francis, one Fray Joan Clemente. A\r\ngreat many natives, suffering from all diseases, are treated there\r\nwith great care and attention. It has a good edifice and workrooms\r\nbuilt of stone. The discalced religious of St. Francis manage it;\r\nand three priests and four lay-brothers, of exemplary life, live\r\nthere. These are the physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries of the\r\nhospital, and are so skilful and useful, that they cause many marvelous\r\ncures, both in medicine and in surgery.\r\n\r\nThe streets of the city are compactly built up with houses, mostly of\r\nstone, although some are of wood. Many are roofed with clay tiling, and\r\nothers with nipa. They are excellent edifices, lofty and spacious, and\r\nhave large rooms and many windows, and balconies, with iron gratings,\r\nthat embellish them. More are daily being built and finished. There\r\nare about six hundred houses within the walls, and a greater number,\r\nbuilt of wood, in the suburbs; and all are the habitations and homes\r\nof Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe streets, squares, and churches are generally filled with people\r\nof all classes, especially Spaniards--all, both men and women,\r\nclad and gorgeously adorned in silks. They wear many ornaments and\r\nall kinds of fine clothes, because of the ease with which these are\r\nobtained. Consequently this is one of the settlements most highly\r\npraised, by the foreigners who resort to it, of all in the world,\r\nboth for the above reason, and for the great provision and abundance\r\nof food and other necessaries for human life found there, and sold\r\nat moderate prices.\r\n\r\nManila has two drives for recreation. One is by land, along the point\r\ncalled Nuestra Señora de Guia. It extends for about a legua along\r\nthe shore, and is very clean and level. Thence it passes through a\r\nnative street and settlement, called Bagunbayan, to a chapel, much\r\nfrequented by the devout, called Nuestra Señora de Guia, and continues\r\nfor a goodly distance further to a monastery and mission-house of\r\nthe Augustinians, called Mahalat. [353]\r\n\r\nThe other drive extends through one of the city gates to a native\r\nsettlement, called Laguio, by which one may go to a chapel of San\r\nAnton, and to a monastery and mission-house of discalced Franciscans,\r\na place of great devotion, near the city, called La Candelaria. [354]\r\n\r\nThis city is the capital of the kingdom and the head of the\r\ngovernment of all the islands. It is the metropolis of the other\r\ncities and settlements of the islands. In it reside the Audiencia and\r\nChancillería of his Majesty, and the governor and captain-general of\r\nthe islands. [355]\r\n\r\nManila has a city cabildo with two alcaldes-in-ordinary, twelve\r\nperpetual regidors, an alguaçil-mayor [i.e., chief constable], a royal\r\nstandard-bearer, the scrivener of the cabildo, and other officials.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of the Filipinas Islands resides in this city. He has\r\nhis metropolitan church, and all the cathedral dignitaries--canons,\r\nracioneros, medias racioneros, [356] chaplains, and sacristans--and a\r\nmusic-choir, who chant to the accompaniment of the organ and of flutes\r\n[ministriles]. The cathedral is quite ornate and well decorated,\r\nand the Divine offices are celebrated there with the utmost gravity\r\nand ceremony. As suffragans the cathedral has three bishops--namely,\r\nin the island of Sebu, and in Cagayan and Camarines. [357]\r\n\r\nThere is a royal treasury with three royal officials--factor,\r\naccountant, and treasurer--by whom the royal revenue of all the\r\nislands is managed. [358]\r\n\r\nThe vessels sailing annually to Nueva España with the merchandise and\r\ninvestments of all the islands are despatched from the city of Manila;\r\nand they return thither from Nueva España with the proceeds of this\r\nmerchandise, and the usual reënforcements.\r\n\r\nIn the city is established the camp of the regular soldiers whom his\r\nMajesty has had stationed in the islands.\r\n\r\nSeveral galleys are also stationed at Manila with their general and\r\ncaptains, as well as other war-vessels, of deep draft, and smaller\r\nones built like those used by the natives, to attend to the needs of\r\nall the islands.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the vessels from China, Japon, Maluco, Borney, Sian,\r\nMalaca, and India, that come to the Filipinas with their merchandise\r\nand articles of trade, gather in the bay and river of Manila. In that\r\ncity they sell and trade for all the islands and their settlements.\r\n\r\nIn the province [of Cagayán] of this same island of Luzon was founded\r\nthe city of Segovia, [359] during the term of Don Gonçalo Ronquillo,\r\nthe third governor. It has two hundred Spanish inhabitants who live in\r\nwooden houses on the shore of the Tajo River, two leguas from the sea\r\nand port of Camalayuga. There is a stone fort near the city for the\r\ndefense of it and of the river. This fort mounts some artillery, and\r\nhas its own commandant. Besides the inhabitants, there are generally\r\none hundred regular soldiers, arquebusiers, and their officers. They\r\nare all in charge and under command of the alcalde-mayor of the\r\nprovince, who is its military commander.\r\n\r\nIn that city is established a bishop and his church, although at\r\npresent the latter has no dignitaries or prebendaries. [360] There\r\nis a city cabildo consisting of two alcaldes, six regidors, and an\r\nalguacil-mayor. The city abounds in all kinds of food and refreshment\r\nat very cheap prices.\r\n\r\nThe city of Caçeres was founded in the province of Camarines of the\r\nsame island of Luzon, during the term of Doctor Sande, governor of\r\nthe Filipinas. It has about one hundred Spanish inhabitants; and\r\nhas its cabildo, consisting of alcaldes, regidors, and officials. A\r\nbishop of that province is established there and has his church,\r\nalthough without dignitaries or prebendaries. A monastery of discalced\r\nFranciscans is located there. The government and military affairs of\r\nthat province are under one alcalde-mayor and war-captain, who resides\r\nin Caçeres. The latter is a place abounding in and furnished with all\r\nkinds of provisions, at very low rates. It is founded on the bank of\r\na river, four leguas inland from the sea, and its houses are of wood.\r\n\r\nThe fourth city is that called Santisimo Nombre de Jesus; it is located\r\nin the island of Sebu, in the province of Bicayas or Pintados. It was\r\nthe first Spanish settlement and was founded by the adelantado Miguel\r\nLopez de Legazpi, the first governor. It is a fine seaport, whose water\r\nis very clear and deep, and capable of holding many vessels. The city\r\nhas an excellent stone fort, which mounts a considerable quantity of\r\nartillery, and which has its commandant and officers for the guard\r\nand defense of the port and of the city. It is sufficiently garrisoned\r\nwith regulars, and is under command of the alcalde-mayor, the military\r\ncommander of the province, who lives in the city. The settlement\r\ncontains about two hundred Spanish inhabitants who live in houses\r\nof wood. It has a cabildo, consisting of two alcaldes-in-ordinary,\r\neight regidors, and an alguacil-mayor and his officers. It has a\r\nbishop and his church, like those of other cities of these islands,\r\nwithout prebendaries. [361]\r\n\r\nThe city is provided with food by, and is a station for, the ships\r\ngoing from Maluco to Manila. Through his Majesty's concession they keep\r\nthere a deep-draft merchant vessel, which generally leaves its port\r\nfor Nueva España, laden with the merchandise of the products gathered\r\nin those provinces. It has a monastery of Augustinian religious and\r\na seminary of the Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe town of Arevalo was founded on the island of Oton [Panay], during\r\nthe term of Don Gonçalo Ronquillo. [362] It contains about eighty\r\nSpanish inhabitants, and is located close to the sea. It has a wooden\r\nfort, which mounts some artillery, and a monastery of the Order of\r\nSt. Augustine; also a parish church, with its own vicar and secular\r\npriest. This church belongs to the diocese of the Sebu bishopric.\r\n\r\nIt has a cabildo, consisting of alcaldes, regidors, and other\r\nofficials. There is one alcalde-mayor and military leader in those\r\nprovinces. The town is well supplied with all kinds of provisions,\r\nsold at very low rates.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of Villa Fernandina, [363] which was founded in the\r\nprovince of the Ilocos on the island of Luzon, is settled by Spaniards,\r\nbut very few of them remain there. It has a church, with its own vicar\r\nand secular priest. Now no mention will be made of it, on account of\r\nwhat has been said. The alcalde-mayor of the province resides there,\r\nand the town is situated in the diocese of the Cagayan bishopric.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest beginning of the conquest and pacification of\r\nthe Filipinas Islands, the preaching of the holy gospel therein\r\nand the conversion of the natives to our holy Catholic faith were\r\nundertaken. The first to set hand to this task were the religious\r\nof the Order of St. Augustine, who went there with the adelantado\r\nLegazpi in the fleet of discovery, and those of the same order who\r\nwent afterward to labor in this work, and toiled therein with great\r\nfervor and zeal. Thus, finding the harvest in good season, they\r\ngathered the first fruits of it, and converted and baptized many\r\ninfidels throughout the said islands. [364]\r\n\r\nNext to them in the fame of this conversion, the discalced religious\r\nof the Order of St. Francis went to the islands by way of Nueva\r\nEspaña; then those of the Order of St. Dominic, and of the Society of\r\nJesus. [365] Lastly, the discalced Augustinian Recollects went. One and\r\nall, after being established in the islands, worked in the conversion\r\nand instruction of the natives. Consequently they have made--and\r\nthere are now in all the islands--a great number of baptized natives,\r\nbesides many others in many parts, who, for want of laborers, have been\r\nput off, and are awaiting this blessing and priests to minister to\r\nthem. Hitherto there have been but few missions in charge of secular\r\npriests, as not many of these have gone to the islands; and as very\r\nfew have been ordained there, for lack of students.\r\n\r\nThe Order of St. Augustine has many missions in the islands of Pintados\r\nand has established and occupied monasteries and various visitas. [366]\r\nIn the island of Luzon, they have those of the province of Ylocos,\r\nsome in Pangasinan, and all those of La Pampanga--a large number of\r\nmonasteries; while in the province of Manila and its vicinity they\r\nhave others, which are flourishing.\r\n\r\nThe Order of St. Dominic has the missions of the province of Cagayan,\r\nand others in the province of Pangasinan, where are many monasteries\r\nand visitas. They also administer others about the city.\r\n\r\nThe Order of St. Francis has some missions and monasteries about\r\nManila, all the province of Camarines and the coast opposite, and La\r\nLaguna de Bay. These include many missions.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Jesus has three large missions in the neighborhood\r\nof Manila, which have many visitas. In the Pintados it has many\r\nothers on the islands of Sebu, Leite, Ybabao, Camar [Samar], Bohol,\r\nand others near by. They have good men, who are solicitous for the\r\nconversion of the natives.\r\n\r\nThese four orders have produced many good results in the conversion\r\nof these islands, as above stated; and in good sooth the people\r\nhave taken firm hold of the faith, as they are a people of so good\r\nunderstanding. They have recognized the errors of their paganism\r\nand the truths of the Christian religion; and they possess good and\r\nwell-built churches and monasteries of wood with their reredoses and\r\nbeautiful ornaments, and all the utensils, crosses, candlesticks,\r\nand chalices of silver and gold. Many devotions are offered, and there\r\nare many confraternities. There is assiduity in taking the sacraments\r\nand in attendance on the Divine services; and the people are careful\r\nto entertain and support their religious (to whom they show great\r\nobedience and respect) by the many alms that they give them, as well\r\nas by those that they give for the suffrages and the burial of their\r\ndead, which they provide with all punctuality and liberality.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the religious undertook to teach the natives\r\nthe precepts of religion, they labored to instruct them in matters\r\nof their own improvement, and established schools for the reading\r\nand writing of Spanish among the boys. They taught them to serve in\r\nthe church, to sing the plain-song, and to the accompaniment of the\r\norgan; to play the flute, to dance, and to sing; and to play the\r\nharp, guitar, and other instruments. In this they show very great\r\nadaptability, especially about Manila; where there are many fine\r\nchoirs of chanters and musicians composed of natives, who are skilful\r\nand have good voices. There are many dancers, and musicians on the\r\nother instruments which solemnize and adorn the feasts of the most\r\nholy sacrament, and many other feasts during the year. The native\r\nboys present dramas and comedies, both in Spanish and in their own\r\nlanguage, very charmingly. This is due to the care and interest of\r\nthe religious, who work tirelessly for the natives' advancement. [367]\r\n\r\nIn these islands there is no native province or settlement which\r\nresists conversion or does not desire it. But, as above stated,\r\nbaptism has been postponed in some districts, for lack of workers\r\nto remain with the people, in order that they may not retrograde and\r\nreturn to their idolatries. In this work, the best that is possible\r\nis done, for the mission-fields are very large and extensive. In many\r\ndistricts the religious make use, in their visitas, of certain of the\r\nnatives who are clever and well instructed, so that these may teach\r\nthe others to pray daily, instruct them in other matters touching\r\nreligion, and see that they come to mass at the central missions; and\r\nin this way they succeed in preserving and maintaining their converts.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the orders who control these missions in virtue of the\r\nomnimodo and other apostolic concessions [368] have attended to the\r\nconversion of the natives, administered the sacraments, looked after\r\nthe spiritual and temporal and ecclesiastical affairs of the natives,\r\nand absolved them in cases of difficulty. But now that there are an\r\narchbishop and bishops, this is being curtailed, and the management\r\nof these affairs is being given to the bishops, as the archbishop's\r\nvicars--although not to such an extent, nor has the administration\r\nof these natives been placed in their charge, in matters of justice,\r\nand under the inspection and superintendence of the bishops, as they\r\nhave endeavored to obtain. [369]\r\n\r\nThe governor and royal Audiencia of Manila attend to what it is\r\nadvisable to provide and direct for the greatest accomplishment and\r\nadvancement of this conversion, and the administration of the natives\r\nand their missions--both by causing the encomenderos to assist\r\nthe religious and churches, in the encomiendas that they enjoy,\r\nwith the stipends and necessary expenses of the missions; and by\r\nfurnishing from the royal revenues what pertains to it, which is no\r\nless a sum. [370] They also ordain whatever else is required to be\r\nprovided and remedied for the said missions and for the advancement\r\nof the natives. This also is attended to by the archbishop and the\r\nbishops in what pertains to them in their duty and charge as pastors.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Office of the Inquisition, residing in Mexico of Nueva\r\nEspaña, has its commissaries, servants, and helpers in Manila and\r\nin the bishoprics of the islands, who attend to matters touching\r\nthe Holy Office. They never fail to have plenty to do there because\r\nof the entrance of so many strangers into those districts. However,\r\nthis holy tribunal does not have jurisdiction of the causes pertaining\r\nto the natives, as the latter are so recently converted.\r\n\r\nAll these islands are subdued, and are governed from Manila by means\r\nof alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and lieutenants, each of whom rules\r\nand administers justice in his own district and province. Appeals from\r\ntheir acts and sentences go to the royal Audiencia. The governor and\r\ncaptain-general provides what pertains to government and war.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs, who formerly held the other natives in subjection,\r\nnow have no power over them in the tyrannical manner of former\r\ndays. This was not the least benefit received by these natives in\r\nhaving been freed from such servitude. However, it is true that\r\nmatters touching the slavery of former days have remained on the\r\nsame footing as before. The king our sovereign has ordered by his\r\ndecrees that the honors of the chiefs be preserved to them as such;\r\nand that the other natives recognize them and assist them with certain\r\nof the labors that they used to give when pagans. This is done with\r\nthe lords and possessors of barangays, and those belonging to such and\r\nsuch a barangay are under that chief's control. When he harvests his\r\nrice, they go one day to help him; and the same if he builds a house,\r\nor rebuilds one. This chief lord of a barangay collects tribute from\r\nhis adherents, and takes charge of these collections, to pay them to\r\nthe encomendero. [371]\r\n\r\nBesides the above, each village has a governor [372] who is elected. He\r\nand his constables who are called vilangos [373] comprise the\r\nusual magistracy among the natives. The governor hears civil suits\r\nwhere a moderate sum is involved; in appeal, the case goes to the\r\ncorregidor or alcalde-mayor of the province. These governors are\r\nelected annually by the votes of all the married natives of such\r\nand such a village. The governor of Manila confirms the election,\r\nand gives the title of governor to the one elected, and orders him to\r\ntake the residencia of the outgoing governor. [374] This governor,\r\nin addition to the vilangos and scrivener (before whom he makes his\r\nacts in writing, in the language of the natives of that province),\r\n[375] holds also the chiefs--lords of barangays, and those who are\r\nnot so--under his rule and government, and, for any special service,\r\nsuch as collections of tributes, and assignments of personal services,\r\nas his datos and mandones. [376] They do not allow the chiefs to\r\noppress the timaguas or slaves under their control.\r\n\r\nThe same customs observed by these natives in their paganism, are\r\nobserved by them since they have become Christians, in so far as\r\nthey are not contrary to natural law, especially as to their slavery,\r\nsuccessions, inheritances, adoptions, wills, and lawful trading. In\r\ntheir suits, they always allege and prove the custom, and are judged\r\nby it, according to royal decrees to that effect. In other causes\r\nwhich do not involve their customs, and in criminal cases, the matter\r\nis determined by law as among Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAll of these islands and their natives, so far as they were pacified,\r\nwere apportioned into encomiendas from the beginning. To the royal\r\ncrown were allotted those which were chief towns and ports, and the\r\ndwellers of the cities and towns; and also other special encomiendas\r\nand villages in all the provinces, for the necessities and expenses\r\nof the royal estate. All the rest was assigned to the conquerors and\r\nsettlers who have served and labored for the conquest and pacification,\r\nand in the war. This matter is in charge of the governor, who takes\r\ninto consideration the merits and services of the claimants. [377]\r\nIn like manner the villages that become vacant are assigned. There\r\nare many very excellent encomiendas throughout the islands, and they\r\noffer many profits, both by the amount of their tributes and by the\r\nnature and value of what is paid as tribute. [378] The encomienda\r\nlasts, according to the royal laws and decrees, and by the regular\r\norder and manner of succession to them, for two lives; but it may\r\nbe extended to a third life, by permission. After it becomes vacant,\r\nit is again assigned and granted anew.\r\n\r\nThe tributes paid to their encomenderos by the natives were assigned\r\nby the first governor, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, in the provinces of\r\nVicayas and Pintados, and in the islands of Luzon and its vicinity;\r\nthey were equal to the sum of eight reals annually for an entire\r\ntribute from each tributario. The natives were to pay it in their\r\nproducts--in gold, cloth, cotton, rice, bells, fowls, and whatever\r\nelse they possessed or harvested. The fixed price and value of each\r\narticle was assigned so that, when the tribute was paid in any one\r\nof them, or in all of them, it should not exceed the value of the\r\neight reals. So it has continued until now, and the governors have\r\nincreased the appraisements and values of the products at different\r\ntimes, as they have deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nThe encomenderos have made great profits in collecting in kind, for,\r\nafter they acquired possession of the products, they sold them at\r\nhigher prices. By this they increased their incomes and the proceeds\r\nof their encomiendas considerably; until a few years ago his Majesty,\r\nby petition of the religious and the pressure that they brought to\r\nbear on him in this matter, ordered for this region that the natives\r\nshould pay their tribute in whatever they wished--in kind or in\r\nmoney--without being compelled to do otherwise. Consequently, when\r\nthey should have paid their eight reals, they would have fulfilled\r\ntheir obligation. Accordingly this rule was initiated; but experience\r\ndemonstrates that, although it seemed a merciful measure, and one\r\nfavorable to the natives, it is doing them great injury. For, since\r\nthey naturally dislike to work, they do not sow, spin, dig gold,\r\nrear fowls, or raise other food supplies, as they did before, when\r\nthey had to pay the tribute in those articles. They easily obtain,\r\nwithout so much work, the peso of money which is the amount of their\r\ntribute. Consequently it follows that the natives have less capital\r\nand wealth, because they do not work; and the country, which was\r\nformerly very well provided and well-supplied with all products,\r\nis now suffering want and deprivation of them. The owners of the\r\nencomiendas, both those of his Majesty and those of private persons\r\nwho possess them, have sustained considerable loss and reduction in\r\nthe value of the encomiendas.\r\n\r\nWhen Gomez Perez Dasmariñas was appointed governor of the Filipinas,\r\nhe brought royal decrees ordering the formation of the camp in Manila,\r\nwith an enrollment of four hundred paid soldiers, with their officers,\r\ngalleys, and other military supplies, for the defense and security\r\nof the country. Before that time all the Spanish inhabitants had\r\nattended to that without any pay. Then an increase of two reals to\r\neach tributario over the eight reals was ordered. This was to be\r\ncollected by the encomenderos at the same time when they collected\r\nthe eight reals of the tribute, and was to be delivered and placed\r\nin the royal treasury. There this amount was to be entered on an\r\naccount separate from that of the other revenue of his Majesty, and\r\nwas to be applied in the following manner: one and one-half reals for\r\nthe expenses of the said camp and war stores; and the remaining half\r\nreal for the pay of the prebendaries of the Manila church, which his\r\nMajesty pays from his treasury, until such time as their tithes and\r\nincomes suffice for their sustenance. [379]\r\n\r\nThese tributes are collected from all the natives, Christians and\r\ninfidels, in their entirety--except that in those encomiendas without\r\ninstruction the encomendero does not take the fourth part of the eight\r\nreals (which equals two reals) for himself, since that encomienda has\r\nno instruction or expenses for it; but he takes them and deposits\r\nthem in Manila, in a fund called \"the fourths.\" [380] The money\r\nobtained from this source is applied to and spent in hospitals for\r\nthe natives, and in other works beneficial to them, at the option of\r\nthe governor. As fast as the encomiendas are supplied with instruction\r\nand religious, the collection of these fourths and their expenditure\r\nin these special works cease.\r\n\r\nSome provinces have taken the census of their natives; and according to\r\nthese the tributes and the assignment of the two reals are collected.\r\n\r\nIn most of the provinces no census has been taken, and the tributes\r\nare collected when due by the encomenderos and their collectors,\r\nthrough the chiefs of their encomiendas, by means of the lists and\r\nmemoranda of former years. From them the names of the deceased and of\r\nthose who have changed their residence are erased, and the names of\r\nthose who have grown up, and of those who have recently moved into the\r\nencomienda, are added. When any shortage is perceived in the accounts,\r\na new count is requested and made.\r\n\r\nThe natives are free to move from one island to another, and from\r\none province to another, and pay their tribute for that year in which\r\nthey move and change their residence in the place to which they move;\r\nand to move from a Christian village that has instruction to another\r\nvillage possessing it. But, on the other hand, they may not move from\r\na place having instruction to one without it, nor in the same village\r\nfrom one barangay to another, nor from one faction to another. In\r\nthis respect, the necessary precautions are made by the government,\r\nand the necessary provisions by the Audiencia, so that this system\r\nmay be kept, and so that all annoyances resulting from the moving of\r\nthe settled natives of one place to another place may be avoided.\r\n\r\nNeither are the natives allowed to go out of their villages for\r\ntrade, except by permission of the governor, or of his alcaldes-mayor\r\nand justices, or even of the religious, who most often have been\r\nembarrassed by this, because of the instruction. This is done so that\r\nthe natives may not wander about aimlessly when there is no need of\r\nit, away from their homes and settlements.\r\n\r\nThose natives who possess slaves pay their tributes for them if the\r\nslaves are saguiguilirs. If the slaves are namamahays living outside\r\ntheir owners' houses, they pay their own tributes, inasmuch as they\r\npossess their own houses and means of gain.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards used to have slaves from these natives, whom they had\r\nbought from them, and others whom they obtained in certain expeditions\r\nduring the conquest and pacification of the islands. This was stopped\r\nby a brief of his Holiness [381] and by royal decrees. Consequently,\r\nall of these slaves who were then in the possession of the Spanish,\r\nand who were natives of these islands, in whatever manner they had\r\nbeen acquired, were freed; and the Spaniards were forever prohibited\r\nfrom holding them as slaves, or from capturing them for any reason, or\r\nunder pretext of war, or in any other manner. The service rendered by\r\nthese natives is in return for pay and daily wages. The other slaves\r\nand captives that the Spaniards possess are Cafres and blacks brought\r\nby the Portuguese by way of India, and are held in slavery justifiably,\r\nin accordance with the provincial councils and the permissions of\r\nthe prelates and justices of those districts.\r\n\r\nThe natives of these islands have also their personal services, which\r\nthey are obliged to render--in some parts more than in others--to the\r\nSpaniards. These are done in different ways, and are commonly called\r\nthe polo. [382] For, where there are alcaldes-mayor and justices, they\r\nassign and distribute certain natives by the week for the service of\r\ntheir houses. They pay these servants a moderate wage, which generally\r\namounts to one-fourth real per day, and rice for their food. The same\r\nis done by the religious for the mission, and for their monasteries\r\nand churches, and for their works, and for public works. [383]\r\n\r\nThe Indians also furnish rice, and food of all kinds, at the prices\r\nat which they are valued and sold among the natives. These prices\r\nare always very moderate. The datos, vilangos, and fiscals make the\r\ndivision, collect, and take these supplies from the natives; and in\r\nthe same manner they supply their encomenderos when these go to make\r\nthe collections.\r\n\r\nThe greatest service rendered by these natives is on occasions of war,\r\nwhen they act as rowers and crews for the vireys and vessels that go\r\non the expeditions, and as pioneers for any service that arises in\r\nthe course of the war, although their pay and wages are given them.\r\n\r\nIn the same way natives are assigned and apportioned for the king's\r\nworks, such as the building of ships, the cutting of wood, the trade\r\nof making the rigging, [384] the work in the artillery foundry, and\r\nthe service in the royal [385] magazines; and they are paid their\r\nstipend and daily wage.\r\n\r\nIn other things pertaining to the service of the Spaniards and their\r\nexpeditions, works, and any other service, performed by the natives,\r\nthe service is voluntary, and paid by mutual agreement; [386] for,\r\nas hitherto, the Spaniards have worked no mines, nor have they given\r\nthemselves to the gains to be derived from field labors, there is no\r\noccasion for employing the natives in anything of that sort.\r\n\r\nMost of the Spaniards of the Filipinas Islands reside in the city\r\nof Manila, the capital of the kingdom, and where the chief trade\r\nand commerce is carried on. Some encomenderos live in provinces or\r\ndistricts adjacent to Manila, while other Spaniards live in the\r\ncities of Segovia, Caçeres, Santisimo Nombre de Jesus (in Sebu),\r\nand in the town of Arevalo, where they are settled, and where most\r\nof them have their encomiendas.\r\n\r\nSpaniards may not go to the Indian villages, [387] except for the\r\ncollection of the tributes when they are due; and then only the\r\nalcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and justices. It is not permitted these\r\nto remain continually in one settlement of their district, but they\r\nmust visit as much of it as possible. They must change their residence\r\nand place of abode every four months to another chief village and\r\nsettlement, where all the natives may obtain the benefit of their\r\npresence; and so that the natives may receive as slight annoyance\r\nas possible in supporting them and in the ordinary service that they\r\nrender them. [388]\r\n\r\nThe governor makes appointments to all offices. When the term of office\r\nexpires, the royal Aurdiencia orders the residencia of each official\r\nto be taken, and his case is decided in accordance therewith; and\r\nuntil the residencia is completed, the incumbent cannot be appointed\r\nto any other duty or office. The governor also appoints commandants\r\nof forts, companies, and other military officials, in all the cities,\r\ntowns, and hamlets of the islands. [389]\r\n\r\nCertain offices of regidors and notaries have been sold by royal decree\r\nfor one life. But the sale of these offices has been superseded,\r\nas it is now considered that the price paid for them is of little\r\nconsideration, while the disadvantage of perpetuating the purchasers\r\nin office by this method is greater.\r\n\r\nElections of alcaldes-in-ordinary for all the Spanish towns are held\r\non New Year's day by the cabildo and magistracy. The residencias\r\nof these alcaldes-in-ordinary and their cabildos are ordered by\r\nhis Majesty to be taken at the same time as that of the governor\r\nand captain-general of the islands is taken; and they give account\r\nof the administration of the revenues and the estates under their\r\ncare. However, the governor may take it before this, every year,\r\nor whenever he thinks it expedient and cause the balances of their\r\naccounts to be collected. With the governor's advice and permission\r\nthe expenses desired by the towns are made.\r\n\r\nThe city of Manila has sufficient public funds for certain years,\r\nthrough the fines imposed by its judges; in its own particular\r\npossessions, inside and outside the city; in the reweighing of the\r\nmerchandise and the rents of all the shops and sites of the Sangleys\r\nin the parián; and in the monopoly on playing cards. All this was\r\nconceded to the city by his Majesty, especially for the expenses of\r\nits fortification. [390] These revenues are spent for that purpose; for\r\nthe salaries of its officials, and those of the agents sent to España;\r\nand for the feasts of the city, chief of which are St. Potenciana's\r\nday, May nineteen, when the Spaniards entered and seized the city,\r\nand the day of St. Andrew, November 30, the date on which the pirate\r\nLimahon was conquered and driven from the city. On that day the city\r\nofficials take out the municipal standard, and to the sound of music go\r\nto vespers and mass at the church of San Andres, where the entire city,\r\nwith the magistracy and cabildo and the royal Audiencia, assemble\r\nwith all solemnity. The above revenues are also used in receiving\r\nthe governors at their first arrival in the country, in the kings'\r\nmarriage feasts, and the births of princes, and in the honors and\r\nfuneral celebrations for the kings and princes who die. In all the\r\nabove the greatest possible display is made.\r\n\r\nThe other cities and settlements do not possess as yet so many\r\nsources of wealth or revenue, or the occasions on which to spend\r\nthem--although, as far as possible, they take part in them, in all\r\ncelebrations of the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards living in the islands are divided into five classes of\r\npeople: namely, prelates, religious, and ecclesiastical ministers,\r\nboth secular and regular; encomenderos, settlers, and conquerors;\r\nsoldiers, officers, and officials of war (both on land and sea),\r\nand those for navigation; merchants, business men, and traders; and\r\nhis Majesty's agents for government, justice, and administration of\r\nhis royal revenue.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical prelates have already been stated, and are as\r\nfollows: The archbishop of Manila, who resides in the city, as\r\nmetropolitan, in charge of his cathedral church; he has a salary\r\nof four thousand pesos, [391] which is paid from the royal treasury\r\nannually. Likewise the salaries paid to the holders of the dignidades,\r\n[392] canonries, and other prebends, and those performing other\r\nservices, are paid in the same manner. They are all under royal\r\npatronage, and are provided in accordance with the king's orders. The\r\narchbishop's office and jurisdiction consists of and extends to all,\r\nboth the spiritual and temporal, that is ecclesiastic, and to its\r\nmanagement. [393]\r\n\r\nThe bishop of the city of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Sibu, that\r\nof Segovia in Cagayan, and that of Caceres in Camarines, have the\r\nsame rights of jurisdiction and enjoy the same privileges in their\r\ndioceses, since they are suffragans of the archbishop of Manila;\r\nappeal from their judgments is made to the latter, and he summons and\r\nconvokes them to his provincial councils whenever necessary. They\r\nreceive each an annual salary of five hundred thousand maravedis\r\nfor their support, which is paid from the royal treasury of Manila,\r\nbesides their offerings and pontifical dues. All together it is quite\r\nsufficient for their support, according to the convenience of things\r\nand the cheapness of the country. At present the bishops do not possess\r\nchurches with prebendaries nor is any money set aside for that. [394]\r\n\r\nThe regular prelates are the provincials of the four mendicant orders,\r\nnamely, St. Dominic, St. Augustine, St. Francis, the Society of\r\nJesus, and the discalced Augustinians. [395] Each prelate governs\r\nhis own order and visits the houses. The orders have nearly all the\r\nmissions to the natives under their charge, in whatever pertains to\r\nthe administration of the sacraments and conversion--by favor of,\r\nand in accordance with, their privileges and the apostolic bulls, in\r\nwhich until now they have maintained themselves--and in what pertains\r\nto judicial matters, as vicars of the bishops, and through appointment\r\nand authorization of the latter. The discalced Augustinians as yet\r\nhave no missions, as they have but recently entered the islands.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries are supported by certain special incomes that they\r\npossess and have acquired--especially those of the Augustinians\r\nand those of the Society--and by help and concessions granted by\r\nhis Majesty. The Dominicans and Franciscans do not possess or allow\r\nincomes or properties; [396] and for them, as for the other orders,\r\nthe principal source of revenue is in the alms, offerings, and aid\r\ngiven by the districts where they are established and where they have\r\ncharge. This help is given by both Spaniards and natives, very piously\r\nand generously. They are aided also by the stipend given them from\r\nthe encomiendas for the instruction that they give there. Consequently\r\nthe religious of the orders live well and with the comfort necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first encomenderos, conquerors, and settlers of the islands,\r\nand their issue, are honorably supported by the products of their\r\nencomiendas, and by certain means of gain and trading interests that\r\nthey possess, as do the rest of the people. There are a great number of\r\nthem, each one of whom lives and possesses his house in the city and\r\nsettlement of Spaniards in whose province he has his encomienda. This\r\nthey do in order not to abandon their encomiendas, and thus they are\r\nnearer the latter for their needs and for collections.\r\n\r\nNow but few of the first conquerors who gained the country and went\r\nthere for its conquest with the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi\r\nremain alive.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers and officers of war and of naval expeditions formerly\r\nconsisted of all the dwellers and inhabitants of the islands, who\r\nrendered military service without any pay or salary. They went on all\r\nthe expeditions and pacifications that arose, and guarded the forts\r\nand presidios, and cities and settlements. This was their principal\r\nexercise and occupation. They were rewarded by the governor, who\r\nprovided them with encomiendas, offices, and profits of the country\r\naccording to their merits and services. [397]\r\n\r\nAt that time the soldiers of the islands were the best in the\r\nIndias. They were very skilful and well-disciplined by both land\r\nand sea, and were esteemed and respected by all those nations. They\r\ngloried in their arms, and in acquitting themselves valiantly.\r\n\r\nAfterward, when Gomez Perez Das Mariñas entered upon the government of\r\nthe Filipinas, he founded the regular camp of four hundred soldiers:\r\nthe arquebusiers, with pay of six pesos per month; the musketeers,\r\nwith eight pesos; six captains, with annual pay of four hundred\r\nand twenty pesos apiece; their alféreces, sergeants, corporals,\r\nstandard-bearers, and drummers, with pay in proportion to their\r\nduties; one master-of-camp, with annual pay of one thousand four\r\nhundred pesos; one sargento-mayor with captain's pay; one adjutant of\r\nthe sargento-mayor and field-captain, with monthly pay of ten pesos;\r\ntwo castellans; commandants of the two fortresses of Manila, with\r\nfour hundred pesos apiece annually; their lieutenants; squads of\r\nsoldiers and artillerymen; one general of galleys, with annual pay\r\nof eight hundred pesos; each galley one captain, with annual pay of\r\nthree hundred pesos; their boatswains, boatswains' mates, coxswains,\r\nalguacils of the galleys, soldiers, artillerymen, master-carpenters,\r\nriggers, sailors, conscripts, [398] galley-crews of Spanish, Sangley,\r\nand native convicts, condemned for crimes; and, when there is lack\r\nof convicts, good rowers are obtained from the natives for pay,\r\nfor the period of the expedition and the occasion of the voyage. [399]\r\n\r\nIn the vessels and fleets of large vessels for the Nueva España line,\r\nthe ships that are sent carry a general, admiral, masters, boatswains,\r\ncommissaries, stewards, alguacils, sergeants of marine artillery\r\n[condestables], artillerymen, sailors, pilots and their assistants,\r\ncommon seamen, carpenters, calkers, and coopers, all in his Majesty's\r\npay, on the account of Nueva España, from whose royal treasury they\r\nare paid. All that is necessary for this navigation is supplied\r\nthere. Their provisions and appointments are made by the viceroy;\r\nand this has hitherto pertained to him, even though the ships may have\r\nbeen constructed in the Filipinas. They sail thence with their cargo\r\nof merchandise for Nueva España, and return thence to the Filipinas\r\nwith the reënforcements of soldiers and supplies, and whatever else\r\nis necessary for the camp, besides passengers and religious, and the\r\nmoney proceeding from the investments and merchandise. [400]\r\n\r\nAfter the establishment of a regular camp for guard and expeditions,\r\nthe other inhabitants, dwellers, and residents were enrolled without\r\npay under the banners of six captains of the Filipinas, for special\r\noccasions requiring the defense of the city. But they were relieved\r\nof all other duties pertaining to the troops, unless they should\r\noffer of their own accord to go upon any expedition, or volunteer\r\nfor any special occasion, in order to acquire merits and benefits, so\r\nthat they may be given encomiendas that become vacant, and offices,\r\nand the means of profit of the country. They are not compelled or\r\nobliged to do this, unless they are encomenderos. Consequently all\r\nhave given themselves to trading, as there is no other occupation,\r\nbut they are not unmindful of military service.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty prohibits all who are in his pay in the military forces\r\nof the islands from engaging in commerce; and orders the governor\r\nnot to allow this, or permit them to export goods to Nueva España. If\r\nthe governors would observe that order, it would not be amiss. [401]\r\n\r\nThe merchants and business men form the bulk of the residents of\r\nthe islands, because of the great amount of merchandise brought\r\nthere--outside of native products--from China, Japon, Maluco, Malaca,\r\nSian, Camboja, Borneo, and other districts. They invest in this\r\nmerchandise and export it annually in the vessels that sail to Nueva\r\nEspaña, and at times to Japon, where great profits are made from\r\nraw silk. Thence on the return to Manila are brought the proceeds,\r\nwhich hitherto have resulted in large and splendid profits.\r\n\r\nThrough the very great increase of this trade--which was harmful\r\nand prejudicial to the Spanish merchants who shipped goods to Peru\r\nand Nueva España, and to the royal duties collected on the shipments\r\nfrom España--and through the business men of Mexico and Peru having\r\nbecome greedy of trade and commerce with the Filipinas, by means of\r\ntheir agents and factors, so that the trade with España was ceasing\r\nin great measure, and the merchants were sending to the Filipinas for\r\ntheir investments great consignments of silver, which by that means\r\nflowed yearly from his Majesty's kingdoms, to fall into the possession\r\nof infidels: all persons of Nueva España and Peru were prohibited from\r\ntrading and engaging in commerce in the Filipinas, and from taking the\r\nChinese merchandise to those regions. [402] Permission was given to\r\nthe inhabitants and residents of the Filipinas that they alone might\r\ntrade in the said merchandise, and export it. They are to take these\r\ngoods themselves, or send them with persons who belong to the islands,\r\nso that they may sell them. From the proceeds of the said merchandise,\r\nthey may not carry to the Filipinas more than five hundred thousand\r\npesos each year. [403]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of somas and junks (which are large\r\nvessels) generally come from Great China to Manila, laden with\r\nmerchandise. Every year thirty or even forty ships are wont to come,\r\nand although they do not come together, in the form of a trading\r\nand war fleet, still they do come in groups with the monsoon and\r\nsettled weather, which is generally at the new moon in March. They\r\nbelong to the provinces of Canton, Chincheo, and Ucheo [Fo-Kien],\r\nand sail from those provinces. They make their voyage to the city of\r\nManila in fifteen or twenty days, sell their merchandise, and return\r\nin good season, before the vendavals set in--the end of May and a\r\nfew days of June--in order not to endanger their voyage.\r\n\r\nThese vessels come laden with merchandise, and bring wealthy merchants\r\nwho own the ships, and servants and factors of other merchants who\r\nremain in China. They leave China with the permission and license of\r\nthe Chinese viceroys and mandarins. The merchandise that they generally\r\nbring and sell to the Spaniards consists of raw silk in bundles, of\r\nthe fineness of two strands [dos cabeças], and other silk of poorer\r\nquality; fine untwisted silk, white and of all colors, wound in small\r\nskeins; quantities of velvets, some plain, and some embroidered in\r\nall sorts of figures, colors, and fashions--others with body of gold,\r\nand embroidered with gold; woven stuffs and brocades, of gold and\r\nsilver upon silk of various colors and patterns; quantities of gold\r\nand silver thread in skeins over thread and silk--but the glitter of\r\nall the gold and silver is false, and only on paper; damasks, satins,\r\ntaffetans, gorvaranes, picotes, [404] and other cloths of all colors,\r\nsome finer and better than others; a quantity of linen made from grass,\r\ncalled lençesuelo [handkerchief]; [405] and white cotton cloth of\r\ndifferent kinds and qualities, for all uses. They also bring musk,\r\nbenzoin, and ivory; many bed ornaments, hangings, coverlets, and\r\ntapestries of embroidered velvet; damask and gorvaran of different\r\nshades; tablecloths, cushions, and carpets; horse-trappings of the\r\nsame stuff, and embroidered with glass beads and seed-pearls; also\r\nsome pearls and rubies, sapphires and crystal-stones; metal basins,\r\ncopper kettles, and other copper and cast-iron pots; quantities\r\nof all sorts of nails, sheet-iron, tin and lead; saltpetre and\r\ngunpowder. They supply the Spaniards with wheat flour; preserves\r\nmade of orange, peach, scorzonera, [406] pear, nutmeg, and ginger,\r\nand other fruits of China; salt pork and other salt meats; live fowls\r\nof good breed, and very fine capons; quantities of green fruit, oranges\r\nof all kinds; excellent chestnuts, walnuts, pears, and chicueyes [407]\r\n(both green and dried, a delicious fruit); quantities of fine thread of\r\nall kinds, needles, and knick-knacks; little boxes and writing-cases;\r\nbeds, tables, chairs, and gilded benches, painted in many figures and\r\npatterns. They bring domestic buffaloes; geese that resemble swans;\r\nhorses, some mules and asses; even caged birds, some of which talk,\r\nwhile others sing, and they make them play innumerable tricks. The\r\nChinese furnish numberless other gewgaws and ornaments of little\r\nvalue and worth, which are esteemed among the Spaniards; besides a\r\nquantity of fine crockery of all kinds; canganes, [408] sines, and\r\nblack and blue robes; tacley, which are beads of all kinds; strings\r\nof cornelians, and other beads and precious stones of all colors;\r\npepper and other spices; and rarities--which, did I refer to them all,\r\nI would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship reaches the mouth of the bay of Manila, the\r\nwatchman stationed at the island of Miraveles goes out to it in a\r\nlight vessel. Having examined the ship, he puts a guard of two or three\r\nsoldiers on it, so that it may anchor upon the bar, near the city, and\r\nto see that no one shall disembark from the vessel, or anyone enter it\r\nfrom outside, until the vessel has been inspected. By the signal made\r\nwith fire by the watchman from the said island, and the advice that he\r\nsends in all haste to the city--of what ship it is, whence it has come,\r\nwhat merchandise and people it brings--before the vessel has finished\r\nanchoring, the governor and the city generally know all about it. [409]\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel has arrived and anchored, the royal officials go to\r\ninspect it and the register of the merchandise aboard it. At the\r\nsame time the valuation of the cargo is made according to law, of\r\nwhat it is worth in Manila; for the vessel immediately pays three per\r\ncent on everything to his Majesty. [410] After the register has been\r\ninspected and the valuation made, then the merchandise is immediately\r\nunloaded by another official into champans, and taken to the Parián,\r\nor to other houses and magazines, outside of the city. There the\r\ngoods are freely sold.\r\n\r\nNo Spaniard, Sangley, or other person is allowed to go to the ship\r\nto buy or trade merchandise, food, or anything else. Neither is it\r\nallowed, when the merchandise is ashore, to take it from them or\r\nbuy it with force and violence; but the trade must be free, and the\r\nSangleys can do what they like with their property.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary price of the silks (both raw and woven) and the\r\ncloths--which form the bulk of the cargo--is settled leisurely, and\r\nby persons who understand it, both on the part of the Spaniards and\r\nthat of the Sangleys. The purchase price is paid in silver and reals,\r\nfor the Sangleys do not want gold, or any other articles, and will not\r\ntake other things to China. All the trading must be completed by the\r\nend of the month of May, or thereabout, in order that the Sangleys\r\nmay return and the Spaniards have the goods ready to lade upon the\r\nvessels that go to Nueva España by the end of June. However, the\r\nlarger dealers and those who have most money usually do their trading\r\nafter that time, at lower rates, and keep the merchandise until the\r\nfollowing year. Certain Sangleys remain in Manila with a portion of\r\ntheir merchandise for the same purpose, when they have not had a good\r\nsale for it, in order to go on selling it more leisurely. The Sangleys\r\nare very skilful and intelligent traders, and of great coolness and\r\nmoderation, in order to carry on their business better. They are ready\r\nto trust and accommodate freely whoever they know treats them fairly,\r\nand does not fail in his payments to them when these are due. On\r\nthe other hand, as they are a people without religion or conscience,\r\nand so greedy, they commit innumerable frauds and deceits in their\r\nmerchandise. The purchaser must watch them very closely, and know\r\nthem, in order not to be cheated by them. The purchasers, however,\r\nacquit themselves by their poor payments and the debts that they incur;\r\nand both sides generally keep the judges and Audiencia quite busy.\r\n\r\nSome Japanese and Portuguese merchantmen also come every year from\r\nthe port of Nangasaque in Japon, at the end of October with the north\r\nwinds, and at the end of March. They enter and anchor at Manila\r\nin the same way. The bulk of their cargo is excellent wheat-flour\r\nfor the provisioning of Manila, and highly prized salt meats. They\r\nalso bring some fine woven silk goods of mixed colors; beautiful and\r\nfinely-decorated screens done in oil and gilt; all kinds of cutlery;\r\nmany suits of armor, spears, catans, and other weapons, all finely\r\nwrought; writing-cases, boxes and small cases of wood, japanned\r\nand curiously marked; other pretty gewgaws; excellent fresh pears;\r\nbarrels and casks of good salt tunny; cages of sweet-voiced larks,\r\ncalled fimbaros; and other trifles. In this trading, some purchases\r\nare also made, without royal duties being collected from those\r\nvessels. The bulk of the merchandise is used in the country, but\r\nsome goods are exported to Nueva España. The price is generally paid\r\nin reals, although they are not so greedy for them as the Chinese,\r\nfor there is silver in Japon. They generally bring a quantity of it\r\nas merchandise in plates, and it is sold at moderate rates.\r\n\r\nThese vessels return to Japon at the season of the vendavals, during\r\nthe months of June and July. They carry from Manila their purchases,\r\nwhich are composed of raw Chinese silk, gold, deerskin, and brazil-wood\r\nfor their dyes. They take honey, manufactured wax, palm and Castilian\r\nwine, civet-cats, large tibors in which to store their tea, glass,\r\ncloth, and other curiosities from España.\r\n\r\nSome Portuguese vessels sail to Manila annually during the monsoon\r\nof the vendavals, from Maluco, Malaca, and India. They take\r\nmerchandise consisting of spices--cloves, cinnamon, and pepper;\r\nslaves, both blacks and Cafres; cotton cloth of all sorts, fine\r\nmuslins [caniquies], linens, gauzes, rambuties, and other delicate\r\nand precious cloths; amber, and ivory; cloths edged with pita,\r\n[411] for use as bed-covers; hangings, and rich counterpanes from\r\nVengala [Bengal], Cochin, and other countries; many gilt articles\r\nand curiosities; jewels of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, topazes,\r\nbalas-rubies, and other precious stones, both set and loose; many\r\ntrinkets and ornaments from India; wine, raisins, and almonds;\r\ndelicious preserves, and other fruits brought from Portugal and\r\nprepared in Goa; carpets and tapestries from Persia and Turquia,\r\nmade of fine silks and wools; beds, writing-cases, parlor-chairs,\r\nand other finely-gilded furniture, made in Macao; needle-work in\r\ncolors and in white, of chain-lace and royal point lace, and other\r\nfancy-work of great beauty and perfection. Purchases of all the above\r\nare made in Manila, and paid in reals and gold. The vessels return\r\nin January with the brisas, which is their favorable monsoon. They\r\ncarry to Maluco provisions of rice and wine, crockery-ware, and\r\nother wares needed there; while to Malaca they take only the gold or\r\nmoney, besides a few special trinkets and curiosities from España,\r\nand emeralds. The royal duties are not collected from these vessels.\r\n\r\nA few smaller vessels also sail from Borneo, during the vendavals. They\r\nbelong to the natives of that island, and return during the first part\r\nof the brisas. They enter the river of Manila and sell their cargoes\r\nin their vessels. These consist of fine and well-made palm-mats, a few\r\nslaves for the natives, sago--a certain food of theirs prepared from\r\nthe pith of palms--and tibors; large and small jars, glazed black and\r\nvery fine, which are of great service and use; and excellent camphor,\r\nwhich is produced on that island. Although beautiful diamonds are found\r\non the opposite coast, they are not taken to Manila by those vessels,\r\nfor the Portuguese of Malaca trade for them on that coast. These\r\narticles from Borneo are bought more largely by the natives than by\r\nthe Spaniards. The articles taken back by the Borneans are provisions\r\nof wine and rice, cotton cloth, and other wares of the islands,\r\nwhich are wanting in Borneo.\r\n\r\nVery seldom a few vessels sail to Manila from Sian and Camboja. They\r\ncarry some benzoin, pepper, ivory, and cotton cloth; rubies and\r\nsapphires, badly cut and set; a few slaves; rhinoceros horns, and the\r\nhides, hoofs, and teeth of this animal; and other goods. In return they\r\ntake the wares found in Manila. Their coming and return is between the\r\nbrisas and the vendavals, during the months of April, May, and June.\r\n\r\nIn these classes of merchandise, and in the products of the\r\nislands--namely, gold, cotton cloth, mendriñaque, and cakes of white\r\nand yellow wax--do the Spaniards effect their purchases, investments,\r\nand exports for Nueva España. They make these as is most suitable\r\nfor each person, and lade them on the vessels that are to make the\r\nvoyage. They value and register these goods, for they pay into the\r\nroyal treasury of Manila, before the voyage, the two per cent royal\r\nduties on exports, besides the freight charges of the vessel, which\r\namount to forty Castilian ducados [412] per tonelada. This latter is\r\npaid at the port of Acapulco in Nueva España, into the royal treasury\r\nof the said port, in addition to the ten per cent duties for entrance\r\nand first sale in Nueva España.  [413]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the ships which are despatched with the said merchandise\r\nare at his Majesty's account, and other ships cannot be sent, there\r\nis generally too small a place in the cargo for all the purchases. For\r\nthat reason the governor divides the cargo-room among all the shippers,\r\naccording to their wealth and merits, after they have been examined\r\nby intelligent men, appointed for that purpose. Consequently every\r\nman knows from his share how much he can export, and only that amount\r\nis received in the vessel; and careful and exact account is taken of\r\nit. Trustworthy persons are appointed who are present at the lading;\r\nand space is left for the provisions and passengers that are to go\r\nin the vessels. When the ships are laden and ready to sail, they\r\nare delivered to the general and the officials who have them in\r\ncharge. Then they start on their voyage at the end of the month of\r\nJune, with the first vendavals.\r\n\r\nThis trade and commerce is so great and profitable, and easy to\r\ncontrol--for it only lasts three months in the year, from the\r\ntime of the arrival of the ships with their merchandise, until\r\nthose vessels that go to Nueva España take that merchandise--that\r\nthe Spaniards do not apply themselves to, or engage in, any other\r\nindustry. Consequently, there is no husbandry or field-labor worthy of\r\nconsideration. Neither do the Spaniards work the gold mines or placers,\r\nwhich are numerous. They do not engage in many other industries that\r\nthey could turn to with great profit, if the Chinese trade should\r\nfail them. That trade has been very hurtful and prejudicial in\r\nthis respect, as well as for the occupations and farm industries in\r\nwhich the natives used to engage. Now the latter are abandoning and\r\nforgetting those labors. Besides, there is the great harm and loss\r\nresulting from the immense amount of silver that passes annually by\r\nthis way [of the trade], into the possession of infidels, which can\r\nnever, by any way, return into the possession of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's agents for the government and justice, and the royal\r\nofficials for the management of his Majesty's revenue, are as follows:\r\nFirst, the governor and captain-general of all the islands, who\r\nis at the same time president of the royal Audiencia of Manila. He\r\nhas a salary of eight thousand pesos de minas per year for all his\r\noffices. [414] He possesses his own body-guard of twelve halberdiers,\r\nwhose captain receives three hundred pesos per year. The governor alone\r\nprovides and regulates all that pertains to war and government, with\r\nthe advice of the auditors of the Audiencia in difficult matters. He\r\ntries in the first instance the criminal cases of the regular soldiers,\r\nand any appeals from his decisions go to the Audiencia. [415] The\r\ngovernor appoints many alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, deputies, and\r\nother magistrates, throughout the islands and their provinces, for\r\ncarrying on the government and justice, and for military matters. These\r\nappointments are made before a government chief scrivener appointed\r\nby his Majesty, who helps the governor.\r\n\r\nThe governor likewise takes part with the royal Audiencia, as\r\nits president, in whatever pertains to its duties. The Audiencia\r\nconsists of four auditors and one fiscal--each of whom receives an\r\nannual salary of two thousand pesos de minas [416]--one reporter,\r\none court scrivener, one alguacil-mayor, with his assistants, one\r\ngovernor of the prison of the court, one chancellor, one registrar,\r\ntwo bailiffs, one chaplain and sacristan, one executioner, attorneys,\r\nand receivers. The Audiencia tries all causes, civil and criminal,\r\ntaken to it from all the provinces of its district. [417] These\r\ninclude the Filipinas Islands and the mainland of China, already\r\ndiscovered or to be discovered. The Audiencia has the same authority\r\nas the chancillerías of Valladolid and Granada in España. At the same\r\ntime, the Audiencia provides whatever is advisable for the proper\r\nand systematic management of the royal exchequer.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's revenues in the Filipinas Islands are in charge\r\nof and their tribunal consists of three royal officials. They are\r\nappointed by his Majesty, and consist of a factor, an accountant, and\r\na treasurer. They each receive an annual salary of five hundred and\r\nten thousand maravedis. They have their clerk of mines, and registrars\r\nof the royal revenues, and their executive and other officials, all\r\nof whom reside in Manila. From that city they manage and attend to\r\neverything pertaining to the royal revenues throughout the islands.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty has a number of encomiendas apportioned to his royal crown\r\nthroughout the provinces of the Filipinas Islands. The tributes of\r\nthose encomiendas are collected for his royal treasury by his royal\r\nofficials and the collectors engaged for that purpose by the royal\r\nofficials. From year to year these amount to thirty thousand pesos,\r\nafter deducting costs and expenses. They collect, from one year to\r\nanother, eight thousand pesos in tributes from the Sangleys--both\r\nChristians and infidels. [418]\r\n\r\nThey also collect the fifth of all gold dug in the islands. By\r\nspecial concession for a limited period, the tenth is collected\r\ninstead of the fifth. There is a declaration concerning it, to the\r\neffect that the natives shall pay no fifths or other duties on the\r\njewels and gold inherited by them from their ancestors before his\r\nMajesty owned the country. Sufficient measures have been taken for\r\nthe clear understanding of this concession and its investigation,\r\nfor that on which the tenth has once been paid, and the steps to\r\nbe taken in the matter. From one year to another they collect ten\r\nthousand pesos from these fifths, for much is concealed. [419]\r\n\r\nThe assignment of two reals from each tributario inures to the royal\r\ntreasury and is paid into it, for the pay of the soldiers and the\r\nstipend of the prebendaries. These are collected from the encomenderos,\r\nin proportion to, and on the account of, their tributes, and amount\r\nannually to thirty-four thousand pesos.\r\n\r\nThe fines and expenses of justice are committed to the care of the\r\ntreasurer of the royal revenues, and are kept in the treasury. They\r\namount annually to three thousand pesos.\r\n\r\nThe three per cent duties on the Chinese merchandise of the Sangley\r\nvessels average forty thousand pesos annually. [420]\r\n\r\nThe two per cent duties paid by the Spaniards for exporting merchandise\r\nto Nueva España amount annually to twenty thousand pesos. On the\r\nmerchandise and money sent from Nueva España to the Filipinas,\r\nresult eight thousand pesos more. Consequently, in these things and\r\nin other dues of less importance that belong to the royal treasury,\r\nhis Majesty receives about one hundred and fifty thousand pesos,\r\nor thereabout, annually in the Filipinas. [421]\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this amount does not suffice for the expenses that are\r\nincurred, the royal treasury of Nueva España sends annually to that of\r\nthe Filipinas, in addition to the above revenues, some assistance in\r\nmoney--a greater or less sum, as necessity requires. For his Majesty\r\nhas thus provided for it from the proceeds of the ten per cent duties\r\non the Chinese merchandise that are collected at the port of Acapulco\r\nin Nueva España. This assistance is given into the keeping of the\r\nroyal officials in Manila, and they take charge of it, with the rest\r\nof the revenues that they manage and collect.\r\n\r\nFrom all this gross sum of his Majesty's revenue, the salaries of\r\nthe governor and royal Audiencia are paid, as well as the stipends\r\nof prelates and ecclesiastical prebendaries, the salaries of the\r\nmagistrates, and of the royal officials and their assistants; the\r\npay of all the military officers and regular soldiers; his Majesty's\r\nshare of the stipends for instruction, and the building of churches\r\nand their ornaments; the concessions and gratifications that he has\r\nallowed to certain monasteries, and private persons; the building\r\nof large vessels for the navigation to Nueva España, and of galleys\r\nand other vessels for the defense of the islands; expenses for\r\ngunpowder and ammunition; the casting of artillery, and its care;\r\nthe expense arising for expeditions and individual undertakings\r\nin the islands, and in their defense; that of navigations to, and\r\nnegotiations with, the kingdoms in their vicinity, which are quite\r\ncommon and necessary. Consequently, since his Majesty's revenues in\r\nthese islands are so limited, and his expenses so great, the royal\r\ntreasury falls short, and suffers poverty and need. [422]\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from the ten per cent duties and the freight charges of\r\nthe ships, which are collected at Acapulco in Nueva España, on the\r\nmerchandise sent there from the Filipinas, although considerable, are\r\nalso not always sufficient for the expenses incurred in Nueva España\r\nwith the ships, soldiers, ammunition, and other supplies sent annually\r\nto the Filipinas. These expenses are generally greatly in excess\r\nof those duties, and the amount is made up from the royal treasury\r\nof Mexico. Consequently, the king our sovereign derives as yet no\r\nprofit from any revenues of the Filipinas, but rather an expenditure,\r\nby no means small, from his revenues in Nueva España. He sustains the\r\nFilipinas only for the christianization and conversion of the natives,\r\nand for the hopes of greater fruits in other kingdoms and provinces of\r\nAsia, which are expected through this gateway, at God's good pleasure.\r\n\r\nEvery year the Audiencia audits the accounts of the royal officials of\r\nhis Majesty's revenues, strikes the balances, and sends the accounts\r\nto the tribunal of accounts in Mexico. [423]\r\n\r\nIn the city of Manila, and in all those Spanish settlements of the\r\nislands, reside Sangleys, who have come from Great China, besides\r\nthe merchants. They have appointed settlements and are engaged in\r\nvarious trades, and go to the islands for their livelihood. Some\r\npossess their pariáns and shops. Some engage in fishing and farming\r\namong the natives, throughout the country; and go from one island to\r\nanother to trade, in large or small champans. [424]\r\n\r\nThe annual vessels from Great China bring these Sangleys in great\r\nnumbers, especially to the city of Manila, for the sake of the profits\r\nthat are gained from their fares. As there is a superabundance of\r\npopulation in China, and the wages and profits there are little,\r\nthey regard as of importance whatever they get in the Filipinas.\r\n\r\nVery great annoyances result from this; for, not only can there be\r\nlittle security to the country with so many infidels, but the Sangleys\r\nare a wicked and vicious race. Through intercourse and communication\r\nwith them, the natives improve little in Christianity and morals. And\r\nsince they come in such numbers and are so great eaters, they raise\r\nthe price of provisions, and consume them.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the city could not be maintained or preserved without\r\nthese Sangleys; for they are the mechanics in all trades, and are\r\nexcellent workmen and work for suitable prices. But a less number of\r\nthem would suffice for this, and would avoid the inconvenience of so\r\nmany people as are usually in Manila when the ships arrive--to say\r\nnothing of the many Chinese who go about among the islands, under\r\npretext of trading with the natives, and there commit innumerable\r\ncrimes and offenses. At the least, they explore all the country, the\r\nrivers, creeks, and ports, and know them better than the Spaniards\r\ndo; and they will be of great harm and injury in case of any revolt\r\nor hostile invasion of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn order to remedy all the above, it was ordered that the vessels\r\nshould not bring so many people of this kind, under penalties that\r\nare executed; that, when the vessels return to China, they take\r\nthese Sangleys back with them; that only a convenient number of\r\nmerchants remain in Manila, in the Parián, and the mechanics of\r\nall necessary trades; and that these must have written license,\r\nunder severe penalties. In the execution of this, an auditor of the\r\nAudiencia is engaged by special commission every year, together with\r\nsome assistants. On petition of the city cabildo, he usually allows\r\nas many Sangleys to remain as are necessary for the service of all\r\ntrades and occupations. The rest are embarked and compelled to return\r\nin the vessels going to China, and a great deal of force and violence\r\n[425] is necessary to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThose merchants and artisans who remained in Manila before the revolt\r\nof the year six hundred and three had settled the Parián and its\r\nshops. The Parián is a large enclosed alcaicería of many streets,\r\nat some distance from the city walls. It is near the river, and its\r\nlocation is called San Graviel. There they have their own governor,\r\nwho has his tribunal and prison, and his assistants; these administer\r\njustice to them, and watch them day and night, so that they may live\r\nin security, and not commit disorders.\r\n\r\nThose who cannot find room in this Parián live opposite, on the other\r\nside of the river, where Tondo is, in two settlements called Baybay\r\nand Minondoc. They are in charge of the alcalde-mayor of Tondo, and\r\nunder the ministry of the religious of St. Dominic, who labor for their\r\nconversion, and for that purpose have learned the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nThe Dominicans have two monasteries with the requisite assistants,\r\nand a good hospital for the treatment of Sangleys. In a district\r\nkept separate from the infidels, they have a settlement of baptized\r\nSangleys, with their wives, households, and families, numbering five\r\nhundred inhabitants; and the religious are continually baptizing\r\nothers and settling them in that village. But few of them turn out\r\nwell, for they are a vile and restless race, with many vices and bad\r\ncustoms. Their having become Christians is not through the desire\r\nor wish for salvation, but for the temporal conveniences that they\r\nhave there, and because some are unable to return to China because\r\nof debts incurred and crimes committed there.\r\n\r\nEach and all, both Christians and infidels, go unarmed and in their\r\nnational garb. This consists of long garments with wide sleeves, made\r\nof blue cangan (but white for mourning, while the chief men wear them\r\nof black and colored silks); wide drawers of the same material; half\r\nhose of felt; very broad shoes, according to their fashion, made of\r\nblue silk embroidered with braid--with several soles, well-sewed--and\r\nof other stuffs. Their hair is long and very black, and they take\r\ngood care of it. They do it up on the head in a high knot, [426]\r\nunder a very close-fitting hood or coif of horsehair, which reaches\r\nto the middle of the forehead. They wear above all a high round cap\r\nmade of the same horsehair, in different fashions, by which their\r\ndifferent occupations, and each man's rank, are distinguished. The\r\nChristians differ only in that they cut their hair short, and wear\r\nhats, as do the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThey are a light-complexioned people and tall of body. They have\r\nscant beards, are very stout-limbed, and of great strength. They\r\nare excellent workmen, and skilful in all arts and trades. They are\r\nphlegmatic, of little courage, treacherous and cruel when opportunity\r\noffers, and very covetous. They are heavy eaters of all kinds of meat,\r\nfish, and fruits; but they drink sparingly, and then of hot beverages.\r\n\r\nThey have a governor of their own race, a Christian, who has his\r\nofficials and assistants. He hears their cases in affairs of justice,\r\nin their domestic and business affairs. Appeals from him go to the\r\nalcalde-mayor of Tondo or of the Parián, and from all these to the\r\nAudiencia, which also gives especial attention to this nation and\r\nwhatever pertains to it.\r\n\r\nNo Sangley can live or own a house outside these settlements of\r\nthe Parián, and of Baybay and Minondoc. Native settlements are not\r\nallowed in Sangley settlements, or even near them. No Sangley can go\r\namong the islands, or as much as two leguas from the city, without\r\nspecial permission. Much less can he remain in the city at night,\r\nafter the gates are shut, under penalty of death.\r\n\r\nThere are generally some Japanese, both Christian and infidel, in\r\nManila. These are left by the vessels from Japon, although they are\r\nnot so numerous as the Chinese. They have their special settlement and\r\nlocation outside the city, between the Sangley Parián and the suburb of\r\nLaguio, near the monastery of La Candelaria. There they are directed\r\nby discalced religious of St. Francis, by means of interpreters\r\nwhom the fathers keep for that purpose. They are a spirited race,\r\nof good disposition, and brave. They wear their own costume, namely,\r\nkimonos of colored silks and cotton, reaching half way down the leg,\r\nand open in front; wide, short drawers; close-fitting half-boots of\r\nleather, [427] and shoes like sandals, with the soles of well-woven\r\nstraw. They go bare-headed, and shave the top of the head as far\r\nback as the crown. Their back hair is long, and fastened upon the\r\nskull in a graceful knot. They carry their catans, large and small,\r\nin the belt. They have scant beards, and are a race of noble bearing\r\nand behavior. They employ many ceremonies and courtesies, and attach\r\nmuch importance to honor and social standing. They are resolute in\r\nany necessity or danger.\r\n\r\nThose who become Christians prove very good, and are very devout\r\nand observant in their religion; for only the desire for salvation\r\nincites them to adopt our religion, so that there are many Christians\r\nin Japon. Accordingly they return freely, and without opposition,\r\nto their own country. At most there are about five hundred Japanese\r\nof this nation in Manila, for they do not go to other parts of the\r\nislands, and such is their disposition that they return to Japon, and\r\ndo not tarry in the islands; consequently very few of them usually\r\nremain in the islands. They are treated very cordially, as they are\r\na race that demand good treatment, and it is advisable to do so for\r\nthe friendly relations between the islands and Japon. [428]\r\n\r\nFew people come from the other nations--Sian, Camboja, Borneo, Patan,\r\nand other islands--outside our government; and they immediately return\r\nin their vessels. Consequently, there is nothing special to be said\r\nof them, except that care is exercised in receiving and despatching\r\nthem well, and seeing that they return quickly to their own countries.\r\n\r\nSince I have told, in the short time at my disposal, the\r\ncharacteristics of the Filipinas Islands, and their customs and\r\npractices, it will not be inappropriate to discuss the navigation to\r\nthem since it is made thither from Nueva España; the return voyage,\r\nwhich is not short, or without great dangers and hardships; and that\r\nmade in the eastern direction.\r\n\r\nWhen the islands were conquered in the year of one thousand five\r\nhundred and seventy-four [sic; sc. 1564], the Spanish fleet sailed\r\nunder command of the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, from Puerto\r\nde la Navidad [429] situated in the South Sea, on the coast of Nueva\r\nEspaña, in the province and district of Xalisco and Galicia, where\r\nresides the royal Audiencia of Guadalajara. A few later voyages\r\nwere made also from the same port, until the point for the sending\r\nof these vessels was removed, for better and greater convenience,\r\nto the port of Acapulco, located farther south on the same coast,\r\nin sixteen and one-half degrees of latitude; it is eighty leguas from\r\nMexico, and in its district. It is an excellent port, sheltered from\r\nall weather; and has a good entrance and good anchorages. Its vicinity\r\nis advantageous, being better provisioned and more populous than that\r\nof La Navidad. There a large Spanish colony has been established,\r\nwith its alcalde-mayor, and royal officials who have charge of his\r\nMajesty's treasury; and these attend to the despatch of the vessels.\r\n\r\nThe vessels that sail to the Filipinas, as they are despatched annually\r\non his Majesty's account, must necessarily leave in the certain season\r\nof the brisas, which begin in the month of November and last until the\r\nend of March. This navigation should not be made at any other season,\r\nfor from June the vendavals blow, and they are contrary to the voyage.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these ships sail and are despatched at the end of February,\r\nor at the latest by the twentieth of March. They sail west toward the\r\nislands of Las Velas, [430] otherwise called the Ladrones. The island\r\nof Guan, one of them, lies in thirteen degrees of latitude. Inasmuch\r\nas the vessels on leaving Acapulco are wont sometimes to encounter\r\ncalms, they sail south from sixteen and one-half degrees, in which\r\nthe port is situated, until they strike the brisas, which is generally\r\nat ten or eleven degrees. By this route they sail continually before\r\nthe wind, and without changing the sails, with fresh and fair brisas,\r\nand in other moderate weather, for one thousand eight hundred leguas,\r\nwithout sighting any mainland or island. Then leaving to the south\r\nthe Barbudos and other islands, and advancing gradually to a latitude\r\nof thirteen degrees, they sail until they sight the island of Guan;\r\nand above it, in fourteen degrees, that of La Çarpana [Seypan]. This\r\nvoyage to those Ladrones Islands lasts generally seventy days.\r\n\r\nThe natives of those islands, who go naked, and are a very robust\r\nand barbarous race, go out to sea to meet the ships as soon as they\r\ndiscover them, at a distance of four to six leguas, with many vessels;\r\nthese are one-masted, and are very slender and light. These vessels\r\nhave a counterpoise of bamboo to leeward, and their sails are made\r\nof palm-leaves and are lateen-sails. Two or three men go in each one\r\nwith oars and paddles. They carry loads of flying-fish, dorados,\r\n[431] cocoa-nuts, bananas, sweet potatoes, bamboos full of water,\r\nand certain mats; and when they reach the ships, they trade these for\r\niron from the hoops of casks, and bundles of nails, which they use\r\nin their industries, and in the building of their ships. Since some\r\nSpaniards and religious have lived among them, because of Spanish\r\nships being wrecked or obliged to take refuge there, they come more\r\nfreely to our ships and enter them.\r\n\r\nOur ships sail between the two islands of Guan and Çarpana toward the\r\nFilipinas and the cape of Espiritu Santo, a distance of three hundred\r\nleguas farther on, in the latitude of about thirteen degrees. This\r\ndistance is made in ten or twelve days with the brisas; but it may\r\nhappen, if the ships sail somewhat late, that they encounter vendavals,\r\nwhich endanger their navigation, and they enter the islands after\r\ngreat trouble and stormy weather.\r\n\r\nFrom the cape of Espiritu Santo, the ships enter the strait of Capul\r\nat the islands of Mazbate and Burias; thence they sail to Marinduque\r\nand the coast of Calilaya, the strait of Mindoro, the shoals of\r\nTuley, and the mouth of Manila Bay. Thence, they go to the port of\r\nCabit. This is a voyage of one hundred leguas from the entrance to\r\nthe islands and is made in one week. This is the end of the voyage,\r\nwhich is good and generally without storms, if made in the proper time.\r\n\r\nThese vessels now make the return voyage from the Filipinas to Nueva\r\nEspaña with great difficulty and danger, for the course is a long one\r\nand there are many storms and various temperatures. The ships depart,\r\non this account, very well supplied with provisions, and suitably\r\nequipped. Each one sails alone, hoisting as much sail as possible,\r\nand one does not wait for the other, nor do they sight one another\r\nduring the voyage.\r\n\r\nThey leave the bay and port of Cabit at the first setting-in of\r\nthe vendavals, between the same islands and by the same straits,\r\nby the twentieth of June and later. As they set out amid showers,\r\nand are among islands, they sail with difficulty until they leave\r\nthe channel at Capul. Once in the open sea, they catch the vendaval,\r\nand voyage east, making more progress when they reach the latitude\r\nof fourteen or fifteen degrees.\r\n\r\nThen the brisa starts. This wind is the ordinary one in the South Sea,\r\nespecially in low latitudes. Since it is a head wind, the course is\r\nchanged, and the bow is pointed betwen the north and east, as much\r\nas the wind will allow. With this they reach a higher latitude, and\r\nthe ship is kept in this course until the vendaval returns. Then,\r\nby means of it, the ship again takes an eastern course in that\r\nlatitude where it happens to be, and keeps that direction as long\r\nas that wind lasts. When the vendaval dies, the ship takes the best\r\ncourse that the winds allow, by the winds then blowing between north\r\nand east. If the wind is so contrary that it is north or northwest,\r\nso that the ship cannot take that course, the other course is taken\r\nso that they may continue to maintain their voyage without losing\r\ntime. At four hundred leguas from the islands they sight certain\r\nvolcanoes and ridges of the islands of Ladrones, which run north as\r\nfar as twenty-four degrees. [432] Among these they generally encounter\r\nsevere storms and whirl-winds. At thirty-four degrees is the cape of\r\nSestos, [433] at the northern head of Japon, six hundred leguas from\r\nthe Filipinas. They sail among other islands, which are rarely seen,\r\nin thirty-eight degrees, encountering the same dangers and storms,\r\nand in a cold climate, in the neighborhood of the islands Rica de\r\nOro [\"rich in gold\"] and Rica de Plata [\"rich in silver\"], which are\r\nbut seldom seen. [434] After passing them the sea and open expanse\r\nof water is immense, and the ship can run free in any weather. This\r\ngulf is traversed for many leguas with such winds as are encountered,\r\nuntil a latitude of forty-two degrees is reached, toward the coast of\r\nNueva España. They seek the winds that generally prevail at so high a\r\nlatitude, which are usually northwest. After a long voyage the coast\r\nof Nueva España is sighted, and from Cape Mendoçino (which lies in\r\nforty-two and one-half degrees) the coast extends nine hundred leguas\r\nto the port of Acapulco, which lies in sixteen and one-half degrees.\r\n\r\nWhen the ships near the coast, which they generally sight betwen forty\r\nand thirty-six degrees, the cold is very severe, and the people suffer\r\nand die. Three hundred leguas before reaching land, signs of it are\r\nseen, by certain aguas malas, [435] as large as the hand, round and\r\nviolet colored, with a crest in the middle like a lateen sail, which\r\nare called caravelas [\"caravels\"]. This sign lasts until the ship is\r\none hundred leguas from land; and then are discovered certain fish,\r\nwith half the body in the form of a dog; [436] these frolic with\r\none another near the ship. After these perrillos [\"little dogs\"] are\r\nseen the porras [\"knobsticks\"], which are certain very long, hollow\r\nshoots of a yellow herb with a ball at the top, and which float on the\r\nwater. At thirty leguas from the coast are seen many great bunches of\r\ngrass which are carried down to the sea by the great rivers of the\r\ncountry. These grasses are called balsas [\"rafts or floats\"]. Also\r\nmany perrillos are seen, and, in turn, all the various signs. Then\r\nthe coast is discovered, and it is very high and clear land. Without\r\nlosing sight of land, the ship coasts along it with the northwest,\r\nnorth-northwest, and north winds, which generally prevail on that\r\ncoast, blowing by day toward the land, and by night toward the sea\r\nagain. With the decrease of the latitude and the entrance into a\r\nwarm climate the island of Cenizas [ashes] is seen, and afterward\r\nthat of Cedros [cedars]. Thence one sails until the cape of San Lucas\r\nis sighted, which is the entrance of [the gulf of] California. From\r\nthat one traverses the eighty leguas intervening to the islands of\r\nLas Marias and the cape of Corrientes [\"currents\"], which is on the\r\nother side of California in Val de Vanderas [\"valley of banners\"],\r\nand the provinces of Chametla. Thence one passes the coast of Colima,\r\nSacatul, Los Motines [\"the mutinies\"], and Ciguatanejo, and enters the\r\nport of Acapulco--without having made a way-station or touched land\r\nfrom the channel of Capul in the Filipinas throughout the voyage. The\r\nvoyage usually lasts five months or thereabout, but often six and\r\neven more. [437]\r\n\r\nBy way of India, one may sail from the Filipinas to España, by making\r\nthe voyage to Malaca, and thence to Cochin and Goa, a distance of\r\none thousand two hundred leguas. This voyage must be made with the\r\nbrisas. From Goa one sails by way of India to the cape of Buena\r\nEsperança [Good Hope], and to the Terceras [i.e., Azores] Islands,\r\nand thence to Portugal and the port of Lisboa. This is a very long\r\nand dangerous voyage, as is experienced by the Portuguese who make\r\nit every year. From India they usually send letters and despatches to\r\nEspaña by way of the Bermejo [\"Red\"] Sea, by means of Indians. These\r\nsend them through Arabia to Alexandria, and thence by sea to Venecia\r\n[Venice] and thence to España.\r\n\r\nA galleon bound for Portugal sails and is despatched from the fort of\r\nMalaca, in certain years, by the open sea, without touching at India\r\nor on its coasts. It reaches Lisboa much more quickly than do the Goa\r\nvessels. It generally sails on the fifth of January, and does not leave\r\nlater than that; nor does it usually anticipate that date. However,\r\nnot any of these voyages are practiced by the Castilians--who are\r\nprohibited from making them--except the one made by way of Nueva\r\nEspaña, both going and coming, as above described. And although the\r\neffort has been made, no better or shorter course has been found by\r\nway of the South Sea. [438]\r\n\r\nLaus Deo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Cea is a small town situated in the old kingdom of Léon, on a\r\nriver of the same name. It was a seat of a chateau and a duchy. The\r\nname of the first duke of Lerma was Francisco Gomez de Sandoval y\r\nRojas. Hume's Spain (Cambridge, 1898), mentions one of his sons as\r\nduke of Cea, who is probably the Cristoval Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas\r\nof Morga's dedication.\r\n\r\n[2] The facts of Doctor Antonio de Morga's life are meager. He must\r\nhave been born in Sevilla, as his birth register is said to exist in\r\nthe cathedral of that city. He sailed from Acapulco for the Philippines\r\nin 1595 in charge of the vessels sent with reënforcements that year. He\r\nremained there eight years, during which time he was continually in\r\noffice. In 1598, upon the reëstablishment of the Manila Audiencia he\r\nwas appointed senior auditor. In 1600 he took charge of the operations\r\nagainst the Dutch and commanded in the naval battle with them. He left\r\nthe islands July 10, 1603, in charge of the ships sailing that year\r\nto Mexico. After that period he served in the Mexico Audiencia; and\r\nas late as 1616 was president of the Quito Audiencia, as appears from\r\na manuscript in the British Museum. His book circulated, at least,\r\nin part, in manuscript before being published. Torrubía mentions a\r\nmanuscript called Descubrimiento, conquista, pacificación y población\r\nde ias Islas Philipinas, which was dated 1607, and dedicated to\r\n\"his Catholic Majesty, King Don Phelipe III, our sovereign.\" Morga\r\ncombined the three functions of historian, politician, and soldier,\r\nand his character is many sided and complex. He is spoken of in high\r\nterms as an historian, and Rizal, as well as Blumentritt, exalts him\r\nabove all other historians of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[3] Throughout this work, all notes taken entire or condensed from\r\nJosé Rizal's edition of Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas por el Doctor\r\nAntonio de Morga (Paris, 1890), will be signed Rizal, unless Rizal\r\nis given as authority for the note or a portion of it in the body of\r\nthe note. Similarly those notes taken or condensed from Lord Henry\r\nE. J. Stanley's translation of Morga, The Philippine Islands.... by\r\nAntonio de Morga (Hakluyt Soc. ed., London, 1868), will be signed\r\nStanley, unless Stanley is elsewhere given as authority as above.\r\n\r\nDr. José Rizal, the Filipino patriot, was born in 1861 at Calamba in\r\nLuzón, of pure Tagál stock, although some say that it was mixed with\r\nChinese blood. Through the advice of Father Leontio, a Tagál priest,\r\nhe was sent to Manila to the Jesuit institution Ateneo Municipal--where\r\nhe was the pupil of Rev. Pablo Pastells, now of Barcelona. His family\r\nname was Mercado, but at the advice of his brother, who had become\r\ninvolved in the liberal movement, he took that of Rizal. After taking\r\nhis degree at Manila, he studied in Spain, France, and Germany. He\r\nfounded the Liga Filipina, whose principal tenet was \"Expulsion of\r\nthe friars and the confiscation of their property,\" and which was\r\nthe basis of the revolutionary society of the Sons of the Nation. On\r\nRizal's return to Manila, after several years of travel, in 1892,\r\nhe was arrested and exiled to Dapitan. In 1895, he was allowed to\r\nvolunteer for hospital service in Cuba, but was arrested in Barcelona,\r\nbecause of the breaking out of the Filipino insurrection, and sent\r\nback to Manila, where he was shot on December 30, 1896, by native\r\nsoldiers. Besides being a skilled physician, Dr. Rizal was a poet,\r\nnovelist, and sculptor, and had exhibited in the salon. His first novel\r\nNoli me tangere appeared in Berlin in 1887, and was, as Dr. T. H. Pardo\r\nde Tavera remarks, the first book to treat of Filipino manners and\r\ncustoms in a true and friendly spirit. It was put under the ban by\r\nthe Church. Its sequel El Filibusterismo appeared in 1891.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Edward John Stanley, third Baron of Alderley, and second\r\nBaron Eddisbury of Sinnington, a member of the peerage of the United\r\nKingdom, and a baronet, died on December 10, 1903, at the age of\r\nseventy-six. He was married in 1862 to Fabia, daughter of Señor Don\r\nSantiago Federico San Roman of Sevilla, but had no issue. He spent\r\nmany years in the East, having been first attaché at Constantinople\r\nand Secretary of Legation at Athens. He embraced the Mahometan\r\nreligion and was buried by its rites privately by Ridjag Effendi,\r\nImaum of the Turkish embassy.\r\n\r\n[4] Charles chose as his motto Plus ultra, being led thereto by the\r\nrecent world discoveries and the extension of Spanish dominions. This\r\nmotto is seen on his coins, medals, and other works.\r\n\r\n[5] Perhaps Morga alludes to Argensola, who published his Historia\r\nde la conquista de las Molucas this same year of 1609.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[6] This was the second establishment of the Audiencia, in 1598.\r\n\r\n[7] The term \"proprietary governor\" refers to the regularly appointed\r\n(hence governor in his own right) royal representative who governed the\r\nislands; all others were governors ad interim, and were appointed in\r\ndifferent manners at different periods. The choice of governors showed\r\na gradual political evolution. In the earliest period, the successor\r\nin case of death or removal was fixed by the king or the Audiencia of\r\nMexico (e.g., in the case of Legazpi). Some governors (e.g., Gomez\r\nPerez Dasmariñas) were allowed to name their own successor. After\r\nthe establishment of the Audiencia, the choice fell upon the senior\r\nauditor. The latest development was the appointment of a segundo\r\ncabo, or second head (about the equivalent of lieutenant-governor),\r\nwho took the office ad interim in case of the governor's death or\r\nremoval, or a vacancy arising from any other cause.\r\n\r\n[8] Morga may refer to accounts of the battle with Oliver van\r\nNoordt, or the manuscripts of Juan de Plasencia, Martin de Rada,\r\nand others.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[9] Magalhães and Serrano died on the same day. Argensola commenting on\r\nthis fact says: \"At this time his friend Serrano was going to India;\r\nand although in different parts, the two navigators died on the same\r\nday, almost under like circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n[10] This is too strong a statement, and Morga's knowledge is inexact,\r\nas Magalhães had sailed the eastern seas while in the service of the\r\nPortuguese monarch.\r\n\r\n[11] Argensola (Conquistas de las Islas Malucas, Madrid, 1609)\r\nmentions the expedition sent out by the bishop of Plasencia, Don\r\nGutierre de Vargas.\r\n\r\n[12] An error for 1542.\r\n\r\n[13] Urdaneta received Felipe II's order to accompany the expedition\r\nwhile in Mexico.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nSee VOL. II of this series for Urdaneta's connection with this\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n[14] See abstract of these instructions, VOL. II, pp. 89-100.\r\n\r\n[15] Called Villa de San Miguel at first, according to San\r\nAgustín.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[16] Ruy Lopez de Villalobos, not Legazpi, first gave the name\r\nFilipinas to the archipelago.\r\n\r\n[17] Rizal identifies Rajamora with Soliman, and says that he was\r\ncalled Rajamora or Rahang murã in opposition to Rajamatanda or Rahang\r\nmatanda, signifying, as Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino partially\r\npoints out in an article entitled \"Los Regulos de Manila,\" pp. 87-111\r\nof Artículos varios (Manila, 1887), the young raja and the old raja. In\r\nthe above article, the latter seeks to identify Rajamora or Soliman\r\nwith the Raxobago of San Agustín, and declares that Rajamatanda and\r\nLacandola are identical. The confusion existing in later writers\r\nregarding these names is lacking in Morga, and Rizal's conjecture\r\nappears correct.\r\n\r\n[18] Arigues comes from the Tagál word haligi, which are stout wooden\r\nposts, used to support the frames of buildings. The word is in quite\r\ncommon use in the Philippines among the Spanish speaking people. It\r\nis sometimes used to denote simply a column.--Rizal (in part).\r\n\r\n[19] This was the date of Legazpi's arrival at Manila and not of the\r\nassault, which occurred in 1570.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nGoiti took possession of Manila for the king, June 6, 1570. See\r\nvarious documents in VOL. III of this series.\r\n\r\n[20] The inhabitants of Sebu aided the Spaniards on this expedition,\r\nand consequently were exempted from tribute for a considerable\r\nperiod.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[21] Rizal conjectures that this is a typographical error and should\r\nread de Bisayas ò de los Pintados, i.e., Bisayas or Los Pintados.\r\n\r\n[22] The Tagáls called it Maynila.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nFor the meaning of this name, see VOL. III, p. 148, note 41.\r\n\r\n[23] Rather it was his grandson Salcedo. This hero, called the Hernán\r\nCórtes of the Filipinas, was truly the intelligent arm of Legazpi. By\r\nhis prudence, his fine qualities, his talent, and personal worth,\r\nthe sympathies of the Filipinos were captured, and they submitted\r\nto their enemies. He inclined them to peace and friendship with the\r\nSpaniards. He likewise saved Manila from Limahon. He died at the age\r\nof twenty-seven, and is the only one to our knowledge who named the\r\nIndians as his heirs to a large portion of his possessions, namely\r\nhis encomienda of Bigan. (San Agustín).--Rizal.\r\n\r\nSee also VOL. III, p. 73, note 21.\r\n\r\n[24] \"He assigned the tribute that the natives were to pay to their\r\nencomenderos,\" says San Agustín. \"This was one piece of cotton cloth,\r\nin the provinces where cloth was woven, of the value of four reals;\r\ntwo fanégas of rice; and one fowl. This was to be given once each\r\nyear. Those who did not possess cloth were to give its value in kind\r\nof another product of their own harvest in that town; and where there\r\nwas no rice harvested, they were to give two reals, and one-half real\r\nfor the fowl, estimated in money.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[25] Legazpi dies August 20, 1572.\r\n\r\n[26] \"One thousand five hundred friendly Indians from the islands\r\nof Zebu, Bohol, Leyte, and Panay, besides the many other Indians\r\nof service, for use as pioneers and boat-crews, accompanied the\r\nSpaniards...\" Lacandola and his sons and relatives, besides two hundred\r\nBissayans and many other Indians who were enrolled in Pangasinan,\r\naided them. (San Agustín).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[27] According to San Agustín, more than one thousand five hundred\r\nIndian bowmen from the provinces of Pangasinan, Cagayan, and Pintados\r\naccompanied this expedition. Its apparent motive was to place on the\r\nthrone Sirela, or Malaela, as Colin calls him, who had been dethroned\r\nby his brother.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nSee the relation of this expedition in VOL. IV, pp. 148-303.\r\n\r\n[28] This expedition did not succeed because of the development\r\nof the disease beriberi among the Spanish forces, from which more\r\nthan four-fifths of the soldiers died. More than one thousand five\r\nhundred of the most warlike natives, mostly from Cagayan and Pampanga,\r\naccompanied the expedition.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[29] By making use of the strife among the natives themselves, because\r\nof the rivalry of two brothers, as is recounted by San Agustín.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[30] His name was Zaizufa.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLa Concepción, vol. ii, p. 33, gives the founding of the city of Nueva\r\nSegovia as the resultant effect of this Japanese pirate. He says:\r\n\"He [i.e., Joan Pablos de Carrion] found a brave and intrepid Japanese\r\npirate in possession of the port, who was intending to conquer it and\r\nsubdue the country. He attacked the pirate boldly, conquered him,\r\nand frustrated his lofty designs. For greater security he founded\r\nthe city of Nueva Segovia, and fortified it with a presidio.\"\r\n\r\n[31] Captain Ribera was the first envoy from the Philippines to confer\r\nwith the king on the needs of the country.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nSee VOL. V of this series, pp. 207-209, for his complaints against\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\n[32] The fire caught from the candles placed about the catafalque of\r\nGovernor Gonzalo Ronquillo.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[33] This Pedro Sarmiento was probably the one who accompanied Fathers\r\nRada and Marin, and Miguel Loarca to China in 1575; see this series,\r\nVOL. IV, p. 46, and VOL. VI, p. 116. The celebrated mathematician and\r\nnavigator, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa doubtless belonged to a different\r\nbranch of the same family. The latter was born in Alcahl de Henares,\r\nin 1532, and died toward the end of the century. Entering the Spanish\r\narmy he went to America, perhaps in 1555. As early as 1557 he sailed\r\nin the south seas, and being led to the belief of undiscovered islands\r\nthere, several times proposed expeditions for their discovery to the\r\nviceroy of Peru. He was captain of Mendaña's ship in the expedition\r\nthat discovered the Solomon Islands. Shortly after, at the instance of\r\nthe viceroy, Francisco de Toledo, he visited Cuzco, and wrote a full\r\ndescription of that country. He was the first to study the ancient\r\nhistory and institutions of the Incas in detail. When Drake made his\r\nmemorable expedition into the South Sea, Sarmiento was sent in his\r\npursuit, and he wrote a detailed account of the Strait of Magellan and\r\nhis voyage through it. He later founded a Spanish colony in the strait,\r\nbut it was a failure, and was known afterward as Famine Port. He was\r\na prisoner, both in England and France, being ransomed by Felipe II\r\nfrom the latter country. In navigation he was ahead of his times,\r\nas his writings attest. He was persecuted for many years by the Holy\r\nInquisition on various charges. See Lord Amherst's Discovery of the\r\nSolomon Islands (Hakluyt Soc. ed., London, 1901), vol. i, pp. 83-94;\r\nand Clements R. Markham's Narratives of the voyages of Pedro Sarmiento\r\nde Gamboa (Hakluyt Soc. ed., 1895). Argensola gives (Conquistas de\r\nlas islas Malucas), some account of Sarmiento's expedition to the\r\nstrait in pursuit of Drake. He seems (pp. 167-168) when speaking of\r\nthe incident in our text to confuse these two men. An excellent atlas\r\ncontaining fourteen illuminated and colored maps is also attributed to\r\nSarmiento the navigator, number five being a map of India, including\r\nthe Moluccas and the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[34] See letter by Juan de Moron, VOL. VI, of this series, pp. 275-278.\r\n\r\n[35] It was divulged by a Filipino woman, the wife of a soldier\r\n(Sinibaldo de Mas).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[36] Thomas Cavendish or Candish. He is named by various authors as\r\nEscandesch, Cande, Eschadesch, Embleg, and Vimble.--Rizal. See also\r\nappendix A.\r\n\r\n[37] This memorable expedition of Sir Francis Drake left Plymouth\r\nNovember 15, 1577, but an accident caused their return to the same\r\nport, whence they again sailed on the thirteenth of December. After\r\nvarious fortunes the Strait of Magellan was reached on August 17,\r\n1578. They coasted along the western part of South America, where a\r\nvaluable prize was taken. At the island of Canno \"wee espyed a shippe,\r\nand set sayle after her, and tooke her, and found in her two Pilots\r\nand a Spanish Gouernour, going for the Ilands of the Philippinás:\r\nWee searched the shippe, and tooke some of her Merchandizes, and\r\nso let her goe.\" Thence they voyaged to the Moluccas, which were\r\nreached November 14. Next day they anchored at Yerrenate, where they\r\nwere welcomed. The voyage was continued through the islands, around\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, and thence to England, where they arrived\r\nNovember 3, 1580.

His best years were passed in the missions of\r\nGuatemala. He was one of the first Dominicans to respond to the call\r\nfor missionaries for the Dominican province in the Philippines, leaving\r\nfor that purpose the Salamanca convent, whither he had retired. His\r\nfirst mission was on the river of Bataan. A severe illness compelled\r\nhim to go to the Manila convent, where he was later elected prior,\r\nand then provincial of the entire Dominican field of the islands,\r\nbeing the second to hold that office. He later engaged in the two\r\ndisastrous expeditions as mentioned in our text, and died December 31,\r\n1598. See Reseña biográfica.\r\n\r\n[53] Lantchang or Lanxang is the name of an ancient city in the north\r\nof Cambodia. (Pallegoix's Dictionary).--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[54] Rizal says: \"There exists at this point a certain confusion in the\r\norder, easy, however, to note and correct. We believe that the author\r\nmust have said 'Vencidas algunas dificultades, para la falida, por\r\nauer ydo a efte tiempo, de Camboja a Lanchan, en los Laos vn mádarin\r\nllamado Ocuña de Chu, con diez paroes, etc.;'\" whereas the book reads\r\nthe same as the above to \"Camboja,\" and then proceeds \"a los Laos,\r\nvn mádarin llamado Ocuña de Chu, Alanchan con diez paroes.\" We have\r\naccordingly translated in accordance with this correction. Stanley\r\ntranslates the passage as follows: \"Some difficulties as to setting\r\nout from Alanchan having been overcome, by the arrival at this time in\r\nLaos from Cambodia of a mandarin named Ocuñia de Chu, with ten prahus,\r\netc.\" In the above we follow the orthography of the original.\r\n\r\n[55] The river Me-Kong.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[56] Laksamana, a general or admiral in Malay.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[57] Chow Phya is a title in Siam and Cambodia.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[58] That is, his son or other heir was to inherit the title.\r\n\r\n[59] Rizal conjectures that this word is a transformation of the\r\nTagál word, lampitaw, a small boat still used in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[60] We follow Stanley's translation. He derives the word çacatal\r\n[zacatal] from zacate, or sacate, signifying \"reed,\" \"hay,\" or other\r\nsimilar growths, zacatal thus being a \"place of reeds\" or a \"thicket.\"\r\n\r\n[61] From kalasag, a shield.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[62] Argensola says that this native, named Ubal, had made a feast\r\ntwo days before, at which he had promised to kill the Spanish\r\ncommander.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[63] Perhaps the arquebuses of the soldiers who had been killed in\r\nthe combat with Figueroa, for although culverins and other styles\r\nof artillery were used in these islands, arquebuses were doubtless\r\nunknown.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[64] These considerations might apply to the present [1890] campaigns\r\nin Mindanao.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[65] Argensola says that Cachil is probably derived from the Arabic\r\nKatil, which signifies \"valiant soldier.\" \"In the Malucas they honor\r\ntheir nobles with this title as with Mosiur in Francia, which means\r\na trifle more than Don in España.\" See also VOL. X, p. 61, note 6.\r\n\r\n[66] The Solomon Islands (Islas de Salomon) were first discovered in\r\n1568 by Alvaro de Mendaña de Neyra while on an expedition to discover\r\nthe supposed southern continent between Asia and America. Various\r\nreasons are alleged for the name of this group: one that Mendaña\r\ncalled them thus because of their natural richness; another that\r\nKing Solomon obtained wood and other materials there for his temple;\r\nand the third and most probable that they were called after one of\r\nthe men of the fleet. As narrated in our text, the expedition of 1595\r\nfailed to rediscover the islands. They remained completely lost, and\r\nwere even expunged from the maps until their rediscovery by Carteret\r\nin 1767. The discoverers and explorers Bougainville, Surville,\r\nShortland, Manning, d'Entrecasteaux, Butler, and Williamson, made\r\ndiscoveries and explorations in the same century. In 1845, they were\r\nvisited by d'Urville. H.B. Guppy made extensive geological studies\r\nthere in 1882. The French Marist fathers went there first in 1845,\r\nbut were forced, in 1848, to abandon that field until 1861. They were\r\nthe least known of all the Pacific and South Sea islands. They extend\r\na distance of over 600 miles, and lie approximately between 4º 30'-12º\r\nsouth latitude and 154º 40'-162º 30' east longitude. They lie southeast\r\nof New Britain and northwest of New Hebrides. The larger islands are:\r\nBougainville, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, Guadalconar, Malaita, and San\r\nCristobal, and are generally mountainous, and volcanic in origin,\r\ncontaining indeed several active volcanoes. The smaller islands are\r\ngenerally volcanic and show traces of coral limestone. The climate is\r\nunhealthful, and one of the rainiest in the world. They are extremely\r\nfertile and contain excellent water. The inhabitants are of the Malay\r\nrace and were formerly cannibals. They form parts of the British and\r\nGerman possessions. See Lord Amherst: Discovery of the Solomon Islands\r\n(London, Hakluyt Soc. ed., 1901); H. B. Guppy: The Solomon Islands\r\n(London, 1887); Justo Zaragoza: Historia del descubrimiento australes\r\n(Madrid, 1876).\r\n\r\n[67] These places are all to be found on the old maps.

It reaches a height\r\nof about sixty feet. Its bark exudes a gummy sap, that is used for\r\nsnaring birds. For want of areca, the bark is also used by the Indians\r\nas a substitute. The wood is yellow, and is used for making canoes,\r\nand in the construction of houses. See Delgado's Historia General,\r\nand Blanco's Flora de Filipinas.\r\n\r\n[72] Probably the Pukapuka group or Union Islands.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[73] Perhaps Sophia Island, which is about this distance from\r\nLima.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[74] Nitendi.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[75] The small islets may have been the Taumako Islands; the shoals,\r\nMatema, and the \"island of no great size,\" Vanikoro.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[76] Called kilitis in the Philippines, but we are not aware that\r\nindigo is made of it.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nDelgado (Historia, Manila, 1892) describes the wild amaranths which he\r\ncalls quiletes (an American word, according to Blanco) doubtless the\r\nplant indicated in the text. The native generic name is haroma. There\r\nare numerous varieties, all edible.\r\n\r\n[77] This word is untranslated by Stanley. Rizal conjectures that\r\nit may come from the Tagál word sagã or jequiriti. But it may be a\r\nmisprint for the Spanish sagu or sagui, \"sago.\"\r\n\r\n[78] Pingré's translation of the Descubrimiento de las Islas de Salomon\r\nsays, p. 41: \"On the 17th October there was a total eclipse of the\r\nmoon: this luminary, on rising above the horizon, was already totally\r\neclipsed. Mendaña, by his will, which he signed with difficulty, named\r\nas lady governor of the fleet his wife Doña Isabella de Barreto.\" And\r\nin a note, he [i.e., Pingré] says that he calculated this eclipse by\r\nthe tables of Halley: the immersion must have happened at Paris at\r\n19 hours 6 minutes, and the moon had already been risen since 5 or 6\r\nminutes; so that the isle of Sta. Cruz would be at least 13h. 2m. west\r\nof Paris, which would make it 184 degrees 30 minutes longitude, or\r\nat most 190 degrees, allowing for the Spaniards not having perceived\r\nthe eclipse before sunset.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[79] Probably Ponape.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[80] The Descubrimiento de las Islas de Salomon says: \"The frigate\r\nwas found cast away on the coast with all the crew dead. The galliot\r\ntouched at Mindanao, in 10 degrees, where the crew landed on the\r\nislet of Camaniguin; and while wandering on the shore, and dying of\r\nhunger, met with some Indians, who conducted them to a hospital of\r\nthe Jesuits. The corregidor of the place sent five men of this ship\r\nprisoners to Manila, upon the complaint of their captain, whom they\r\nhad wished to hang. He wrote to Don Antonio de Morga the following\r\nletter: 'A Spanish galliot has arrived here, commanded by a captain,\r\nwho is as strange a man as the things which he relates. He pretends\r\nto have belonged to the expedition of General Don Alvaro de Mendaña,\r\nwho left Peru for the Solomon isles, and that the fleet consisted\r\nof four ships. You will perhaps have the means of knowing what the\r\nfact is.' The soldiers who were prisoners declared that the galliot\r\nhad separated from the general only because the captain had chosen\r\nto follow another route.\"--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[81] Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera in his Historia del descubrimiento de\r\nlas regiones australes (Madrid, 1876), identifies this bay with the\r\npresent Harbor of Laguán.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[82] Lord Stanley translates the above passage, which reads in the\r\noriginal \"que por quede della razon (si acaso Dios dispusiese de\r\nmi persona, o aya otra qualquiera ocasion; que yo, o la que lleuo\r\nfaltemos), aya luz della,\" etc., as \"that an account may remain\r\n(if perchance God should dispose of my life, or anything else\r\nshould arise, or I or she that I take with me should be missing),\r\nand that it may give light,\" etc. Rizal points out that the words\r\n\"o la que lleuo faltemos\" do not refer to Doña Isabel de Barreto,\r\nbut to a similar relation of the voyage that Quiros carried with\r\nhim. We have accordingly adopted the latter's rendering, which is by\r\nfar more probable.\r\n\r\n[83] On the island of Shikoku.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[84] From the Japanese funé, boat. This may be etymologically\r\nequivalent to the English word funny, a kind of small boat.\r\n\r\n[85] Lord Stanley connects this word, which he translates \"monks,\"\r\nwith the Nembuds Koo. These, according to Engelbert Kaëmpfer, historian\r\nand physician at the Dutch embassy in Japan, and who lived from 1651 to\r\n1716, are devout fraternities who chant the Namanda, the abbreviation\r\nof \"Nama Amida Budsu\" (\"Great Amida help us\"). The Dai-Nembudzsui\r\nare persons especially devoted to Amida's worship. Rizal however\r\nrefutes this, and derives Nambaji from the Japanese word Nambanjin,\r\nsignifying \"dweller of the barbaric south,\" as the missionaries came\r\nfrom the south.\r\n\r\n[86] See note 85, ante, p. 119.\r\n\r\n[87] The Spanish word is dojicos, which is etymologically the same\r\nas the French dogiques. This latter term is defined in The Jesuit\r\nRelations (Cleveland, 1896-1901), xxvii, p. 311, note 1, as a name\r\ngiven, in foreign missions, to those natives who instruct their\r\ncountrymen. They officiated in the absence of the priests.\r\n\r\n[88] Fushimi, Osaka, and Sakai.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[89] See VOL. X, p. 171, note 19.\r\n\r\n[90] Santa Ines publishes a translation of the same sentence that\r\nvaries somewhat in phraseology from the above, but which has the\r\nsame sense. It is dated however: \"the first year of Quercho, on\r\nthe twentieth day of the eleventh moon.\" J.J. Rein (Japan, London,\r\n1884) publishes a version different from either, which is as follows:\r\n\"Taikô--sama. I have condemned these people to death, because they\r\nhave come from the Philippine Islands, have given themselves out\r\nas ambassadors, which they are not, and because they have dwelt\r\nin my country without my permission, and proclaimed the law of the\r\nChristians against my command. My will is that they be crucified at\r\nNagasaki.\" For the persecutions in this and succeeding administrations,\r\nsee Rein, ut supra.\r\n\r\n[91] Santa Ines gives the names and order of the crucifixion of\r\nreligious and converts, twenty-six in all. They were crucified in a row\r\nstretching east and west as follows: ten Japanese converts, the six\r\nFranciscans, three Jesuits, and seven Japanese converts, with about\r\nfour paces between each two. The Japanese served the Franciscans in\r\nvarious religious and secular capacities. The six Franciscans were:\r\nFrancisco Blanco, of Monte Rey, Galicia; Francisco de San Miguel,\r\nlay-brother, of Parrilla, in the Valladolid bishopric; Gonzalo\r\nGarcia, lay-brother, of Bazain, East India, son of a Portuguese\r\nfather and a native woman; Felipe de Jesús, or de las Casas, of\r\nMexico; Martín de la Ascension, theological lecturer, of Beasaín,\r\nin the province of Guipuzcoa; and Pedro Bautista, of San Esteban, in\r\nthe Avila bishopric. The Jesuits were, at least two of them, Japanese,\r\nand were not above the rank of brother or teacher. Five Franciscans of\r\nthe eleven in Japan escaped crucifixion, namely, Agustín Rodríguez,\r\nBartolomé Ruiz, Marcelo de Rivadeneira, Jerónimo de Jesús, and Juan\r\nPobre. The first three were forced to leave Japan in a Portuguese\r\nvessel sailing to India.\r\n\r\n[92] The Lequios Islands are identified by Rizal as the Riukiu or\r\nLu-Tschu Islands. J. J. Rein (Japan, London, 1884) says that they form\r\nthe second division of the modern Japanese empire, and lie between\r\nthe thirtieth and twenty-fourth parallels, or between Japan proper\r\nand Formosa. They are called also the Loochoo Islands.\r\n\r\n[93] See Stanley, appendix v, pp. 398-402, and Rizal, note 4, p. 82,\r\nfor extracts and abstracts of a document written by Father Alexander\r\nValignano, visitor of the Society of Jesus in Japan, dated October 9,\r\n1598. This document states that three Jesuits were crucified by mistake\r\nwith the others. The document is polemical in tone, and explains on\r\nnatural grounds what the Franciscans considered and published as\r\nmiraculous. The above letter to Morga is published by Santa Ines,\r\nii, p. 364.\r\n\r\n[94] Santa Ines publishes a letter from this religious to another\r\nreligious of the same order. From this letter it appears that he\r\nlater went to Macan, whence he returned to Manila.\r\n\r\n[95] Called Alderete in Argensola, doubtless an error of the\r\ncopyist.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[96] The same king wrote a letter of almost the same purport to Father\r\nAlonso Ximenez, which is reproduced by Aduarte.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[97] Diego Aduarte, whose book Historia de la Provincia del Santo\r\nRosario (Manila, 1640), will appear later in this series.\r\n\r\n[98] Morga's own account of this, ante, says distinctly that there\r\nwere two vessels and that Bias Ruiz had entered the river ahead of\r\nDiego Belloso. Hernando de los Rios Coronel, however, explains this\r\nin his Relacion of 1621, by stating that one of the two vessels had\r\nbeen wrecked on the Cambodian coast.\r\n\r\n[99] The original is en la puente, which translated is \"on the\r\nbridge.\" We have regarded it as a misprint for en el puerto, \"in\r\nthe port.\"\r\n\r\n[100] This kingdom has disappeared. The ancient Ciampa, Tsiampa,\r\nor Zampa, was, according to certain Jesuit historians, the most\r\npowerful kingdom of Indochina. Its dominions extended from the banks\r\nof the Menam to the gulf of Ton-King. In some maps of the sixteenth\r\ncentury we have seen it reduced to the region now called Mois, and in\r\nothers in the north of the present Cochinchina, while in later maps\r\nit disappears entirely. Probably the present Sieng-pang is the only\r\ncity remaining of all its past antiquity.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[101] That is, his mother and grandmother.\r\n\r\n[102] From which to conquer the country and the king gradually,\r\nfor the latter was too credulous and confiding.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[103] Rizal misprints Malaca.\r\n\r\n[104] Stanley thinks that this should read \"since the war was\r\nnot considered a just one;\" but Rizal thinks this Blas Ruiz's own\r\ndeclaration, in order that he might claim his share of the booty taken,\r\nwhich he could not do if the war were unjust and the booty considered\r\nas a robbery.\r\n\r\n[105] Aduarte says: \"The matter was opposed by many difficulties\r\nand the great resistance of influential persons in the community,\r\nbut as it was to be done without expense to the royal treasury,\r\nall were overcome.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLa Concepción says, vol. iii, p. 234, that the royal officials did\r\nnot exercise the requisite care in the fitting of Luis Dasmariñas's\r\nvessels, as the expedition was not to their taste.\r\n\r\n[106] A Chinese vessel, lighter and swifter than the junk, using oars\r\nand sails.\r\n\r\n[107] Aduarte says that the fleet left the bay on September 17.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLa Concepción gives the same date, and adds that Dasmariñas took in\r\nhis vessel, the flagship, Father Ximinez, while Aduarte sailed in\r\nthe almiranta. The complement of men, sailors and soldiers was only\r\none hundred and fifty. Aduarte left the expedition by command of the\r\nDominican superior after the almiranta had put in to refit at Nueva\r\nSegovia, \"as he [i.e., the superior] did not appear very favorable to\r\nsuch extraordinary undertakings.\" He returned with aid to Dasmariñas,\r\nsailing from Manila September 6, almost a year after the original\r\nexpedition had sailed.\r\n\r\n[108] The island of Corregidor, also called Mirabilis.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[109] The almiranta was wrecked because of striking some shoals,\r\nwhile pursuing a Chinese craft with piratical intent. The Spanish ship\r\nopened in two places and the crew were thrown into the sea. Some were\r\nrescued and arrested by the Chinese authorities.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLa Concepción says that the majority of the Spaniards determined to\r\npursue and capture the Chinese vessel contrary to the advice of the\r\npilot and a few others, and were consequently led into the shoals.\r\n\r\n[110] This man became a religious later. We present his famous relation\r\nof 1621 in a later volume of this series. Hernando de los Rios was\r\naccompanied by Aduarte on his mission.\r\n\r\n[111] It has been impossible to verify this citation. Of the four\r\ngenerally known histories of the Indias written at the time of Los\r\nRios Coronel's letter, that of Las Casas only contains chapters of the\r\nmagnitude cited, and those chapters do not treat of the demarcation\r\nquestion. Gonzalez Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdés: Historia general\r\ny natural de las Indias (Madrid, Imprenta de la Real Academia de\r\nla Historia, 1851), edited by Amador de los Rios, discusses the\r\ndemarcation in book ii, ch. viii, pp. 32, 33, and book xxi, ch. ii,\r\npp. 117, 118; Bartolomé de las Casas: Historia de las Indias (Madrid,\r\n1875), edited by Marquis de la Fuensanta del Valle (vols. 62-66 of\r\nDocumentos inéditos para la historia de España), in book i, ch. lxxix,\r\npp. 485, 486; Antonio de Herrera: Historia general de los Indios\r\noccidentalis (Madrid, 1601), in vol. i, ch. iiii, pp. 50-53, and ch. x,\r\npp. 62-64; Joseph de Acosta: Historia de las Indias (first published in\r\nSpanish in Sevilla in 1590) does not discuss the matter. Neither is the\r\nreference to Giovanni Pietro Maffei's Historiarum Indicarum (Coloniae\r\nAgrippinae, 1590), where the demarcation is slightly mentioned.\r\n\r\n[112] Costa in the original, misprinted cosa in Rizal.\r\n\r\n[113] From the context, one would suppose that Los Rios Coronel wrote\r\nJesuita instead of Theatino.\r\n\r\n[114] Undoubtedly the famous Father Mateo Ricci, called Li-Ma-Teou and\r\nSi-Thaí by the Chinese. He was born in Macerata in 1552, and died in\r\nPekin in 1610. He was one of the greatest Chinese scholars of Europe,\r\nand wrote a number of works in Chinese, which were highly esteemed\r\nand appreciated by the Chinese themselves. He extended Christianity\r\nin the celestial empire more than anyone else, by his tolerance and\r\nkeen diplomacy, by composing with great skill what he could not combat\r\nopenly. This excited the wrath of the Dominicans, and gave rise to\r\nmany controversies....Father Ricci was the associate of the famous\r\nFather Alessandro Valignani.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[115] The latitude of Toledo is 39º 52'; Nankin [Lanquien] 32º;\r\nand Pekin [Paquien] 39º 58'.\r\n\r\n[116] The pico is a measure of weight. Gregorio Sancianco y Goson\r\n(El Progreso de Filipinas, Madrid, 1881) gives its table thus: 1\r\npico = 10 chinantes = 100 cates = 1 tael, 6 décimas = 137 libras, 5\r\ndécimas = 62 kilógramos, 262 gramos, 1 tael = 22 adarmes = 39 gramos,\r\n60 céntimos. The pico is not a fixed weight. In Manila its equivalent\r\nhas been fixed at 137 libras, 6 décimas. In the ports of China and\r\nSingapore the English have adopted the following equivalents: 1 pico\r\n= 133 1/3 English pounds; 1 pico in Manila is equal to 140 English\r\npounds; and 1 English pico equals 131.4 Castilian pounds.\r\n\r\n[117] Certain shells found in the Philippines, and used as money in\r\nSiam, where they are called sigay.\r\n\r\n[118] Father Juan Maldonado de San Pedro Mártir was born in Alcalá\r\nde Guadaira in the province of Sevilla. After a course in the\r\nhumanities and philosophy, he went to Salamanca University to study\r\ncanonical law. He made his profession at the Dominican convent in\r\nValladolid, where he lived in great austerity. He was one of the\r\nfirst to respond to the call of Father Juán Crisóstomo for workers\r\nin the Philippines. He was associated with Father Benavides in the\r\nChinese mission, but was unable to learn the language because of\r\nother duties. He was later sent to Pangasinan, where, in 1588, he\r\nwas appointed vicar of Gabón (now Calasiao). He was definitor in the\r\nManila chapter in 1592, by which he was appointed vicar of Abucay,\r\nin the Bataan district. Shortly after he was again appointed to the\r\nChinese work, and learned the language thoroughly. In 1596, while on\r\nthe unfortunate voyage to Camboja, Father Alonso Jimenez appointed him\r\nvicar-general, but he resigned from this, as well as from the office\r\nof commissary-general of the Holy Office, which he was the first to\r\nhold in the islands. In 1598 he was appointed lecturer on theology,\r\nand in November of the same year went to Camboja. His death occurred\r\nwithin sight of Cochinchina, December 22, 1598, and he was buried in\r\nPulocatouan. He was confessor to Luis Dasmariñas. (Reseña Biográfica,\r\nManila, 1891.)\r\n\r\n[119] Rizal misprints guardia de sus personas que podian, as guardia\r\nde sus personas que pedian.\r\n\r\n[120] This happened afterward and was a constant menace to the\r\nSpaniards, as many letters, reports, and books attest.\r\n\r\n[121] This was the first piratical expedition made against the\r\nSpaniards by the inhabitants of the southern islands.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nBarrantes (Guerras Piraticas) wrongly dates the abandonment of La\r\nCaldera and the incursion of the Moros 1590. Continuing he says:\r\n\"The following year they repeated the expedition so that the Indians\r\nretired to the densest parts of the forests, where it cost considerable\r\ntrouble to induce them to become quiet. For a woman, who proclaimed\r\nherself a sibyl or prophetess, preached to them that they should not\r\nobey the Spaniards any longer, for the latter had allied themselves\r\nwith the Moros to exterminate all the Pintados.\"\r\n\r\n[122] From the Malay tingi, a mountain.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[123] The island of Guimarás, southeast of Panay, and separated from\r\nit by the strait of Iloilo.\r\n\r\n[124] Neither Stanley nor Rizal throws any light on this word. The\r\nSpanish dictionaries likewise fail to explain it, as does also\r\na limited examination of Malay and Tagál dictionaries. Three\r\nconjectures are open: 1. A derivative of tifatas, a species of\r\nmollusk--hence a conch; 2. A Malay or Tagál word for either a wind or\r\nother instrument--the Malay words for \"to blow,\" \"to sound a musical\r\ninstrument,\" being tiyup and tiyupkân; 3. A misprint for the Spanish\r\npifas--a possible shorthand form of pifanos--signifying fifes.\r\n\r\n[125] J. J. Rein (Japan, London, 1884) say that the son of Taicosama or\r\nHideyoshi was called Hideyosi, and was born in 1592. He was recognized\r\nby Taicosama as his son, but Taicosama was generally believed not to\r\nhave been his father. The Yeyasudono of Morga was Tokugawa Iyeyasu,\r\nlord of the Kuwantô, who was called Gieiaso by the Jesuits. He was\r\nalready united by marriage to Taicosama. The men appointed with\r\nIyeyasu to act as governors were Asano Nagamasa, Ishida, Mitsunari,\r\nMasuda Nagamori, Nagatsuka Masaïye, and Masuda Geni. Iyeyasu, the\r\nDaifusama of our text, tried to exterminate Christianity throughout the\r\nempire. He established the feudal system that ruled Japan for three\r\ncenturies, dividing society into five classes, he himself being the\r\nmost powerful vassal of the mikado. He framed a set of laws, known\r\nby his name, that were in force for three centuries. Their basis was\r\ncertain doctrines of Confucius that recognized the family as the basis\r\nof the state. Iyeyasu was a true statesman, an attractive personage,\r\nand a peace-loving man. He was revered after death under the name\r\nof Gongensama. See also Trans. Asiatic Soc. (Yokohama), vol. iii,\r\npart ii, p. 118, \"The Legacy of Iyeyasu.\"\r\n\r\n[126] A manuscript in the British Museum, Dutch Memorable Embassies,\r\nsays that he died September 16, 1598, at the age of sixty-four, after\r\nreigning fifteen years. The regent is there called Ongoschio.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[127] Recueil des voyages (Amsterdam, 1725) ii, pp. 94-95 divides\r\nJapanese society into five classes: those having power and authority\r\nover others, called tones, though their power may be dissimilar;\r\npriests or bonzes; petty nobility and bourgeoisie; mechanics and\r\nsailors; and laborers.\r\n\r\n[128] This battle was fought at Sekigahara, a little village on the\r\nNakasendo, in October, 1600. Some firearms and cannon were used but\r\nthe old-fashioned spears and swords predominated in this battle, which\r\nwas fought fiercely all day. (Murray: Story of Japan, New York, 1894).\r\n\r\n[129] John Calleway, of London, a musician, as stated in van Noordt's\r\naccount.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[130] See appendix B, end of this volume, for résumé of Dutch\r\nexpeditions to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n[131] Cuckara, the ladle formerly used to charge cannon which used\r\nno cartridge, but the loose powder from the barrel.\r\n\r\n[132] The count of Essex, who in command of an English squadron\r\ncaptured the city of Cadiz in 1596. He sacked the city and killed\r\nmany of the inhabitants, leaving the city in ruins. Drake in 1587\r\nhad burned several vessels in the same harbor.\r\n\r\n[133] Called \"San Antonio\" above.\r\n\r\n[134] Portuguese, above.\r\n\r\n[135] The present port of Mariveles, as is seen from Colin's\r\nmap.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[136] Juan Francisco Valdés was preacher in the convent of Santo Niño\r\nde Cebú in 1599, and was a missionary in Caruyan from 1600 until\r\n1606. He died in 1617. Juan Gutiérrez was assistant in the council\r\n[discreto] of the general chapter of his order of 1591. He returned\r\nto Manila after three years and was definitor and minister of Tondo\r\nin 1596, and of Parañaque 1602-1603. After that he returned to Rome\r\na second time as definitor-general, whence he went to Mexico, where\r\nhe exercised the duties of procurator in 1608. See Pérez's Catalogo.\r\n\r\n[137] Perhaps \"in the direction of the island Del Fraile\" is meant\r\nhere, since no port of that name is known.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe expression occurs, however, in at least one other contemporaneous\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n[138] Now Punta de Fuego [i.e., Fire Promontory].--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[139] The Dutch account of this combat says that their flagship carried\r\nfifty-three men before the fight, of whom only five were killed and\r\ntwenty-six wounded.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[140] This is perhaps the brother of Fernando de los Rios Coronel,\r\nmentioned in his letter to Morga, ante, p. 180.\r\n\r\n[141] This is the present Nasugbú, which is located in the present\r\nprovince of Batangas, a short distance below Punta de Fuego or Fire\r\nPromontory, on the west coast of Luzón.\r\n\r\n[142] The governor appears to have ordered this execution of his own\r\nauthority, without trial or the intervention of the Audiencia. Since\r\nthe independence of Holland was not recognized by Spain until 1609,\r\nit is likely that these men were executed as rebels. If the ground was\r\nthat they were pirates, the Dutchmen's own account of their burning\r\nvillages, etc., where there were no Spaniards, is more damaging to\r\nthemselves than the statements of Morga, and enough to make them out\r\nto have been hostes humani generis.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[143] Van Noordt was not wrecked, as will be seen later in\r\nthis work. He returned to Holland after many misfortunes and\r\nadventures.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe Sunda is the strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java.\r\n\r\n[144] Hernando de los Rios Coronel in his Memorial y Relacion\r\nattributes both the loss of these two vessels and also that of the\r\n\"San Felipe\" to Don Francisco Tello's indolence. \"For this same reason\r\nother vessels were lost afterward--one called 'Santa Margarita,' which\r\nwas wrecked in the Ladrones, another, called 'San Gerónimo,' wrecked\r\nin the Catanduanes, near the channel of those islands, and a third\r\nwhich sailed from Cibú, called 'Jesus Maria.'\" But the last-named,\r\nwhich sailed during Pedro de Acuña's administration, was not wrecked,\r\nas claimed by the above author.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[145] Port of Baras (?).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[146] Kachil Kota. Kachil is the title of the nobles. Kota or Kutà\r\nsignifies fortress.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[147] Leonardo y Argensola (Conquesta de las Molucas, Madrid, 1609,\r\npp. 262, 263), reproduces this letter translated into Spanish.\r\n\r\n[148] These considerations were very narrow, and contrary to the\r\ninternational obligations of mutual assistance incurred by the Spanish\r\nby their trading with Japan; such treatment of Japan furnished that\r\ncountry with an additional motive for secluding itself and declining\r\nrelations, the benefits of which were so one-sided: however, the\r\nSpaniards themselves may have felt this only nine years later, for,\r\naccording to the Dutch Memorable Embassies, part i, p. 163, a large\r\nSpanish ship, commanded by Don Rodrigo de Riduera, came from Mexico\r\nto Wormgouw, near Yeddo, in August of 1611; these Spaniards were\r\nrequesting permission from the Japanese emperor to sound the Japanese\r\nports, because the Manila ships were frequently lost on the voyage\r\nto New Spain, for want of knowledge of those ports. \"Moreover, these\r\nsame Spaniards requested permission to build ships in Japan, because,\r\nboth in New Spain and in the Philippines, there was a scarcity of\r\ntimber fit for ships, and also of good workmen.\" In the Philippines\r\nthere was no scarcity of timber, so that the statement to that effect\r\nwas either an error of the Dutch author, or a pretext on the part of\r\nthe Spaniards.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[149] The Dominican Francisco Morales was born at Madrid, October\r\n14, 1567. He professed at the Valladolid convent, where he became\r\nlecturer on philosophy. In the same convent he fulfilled various\r\nduties until 1602, in which year it was determined to send him to\r\nJapan as vicar-general. With other missionaries he was driven from\r\nthe kingdom of Satzuma in 1609. Father Morales worked, however, in\r\nthe capital until the persecution of 1614, when he remained hidden\r\nin the country. He was arrested March 15, 1619. A week after he\r\nwas conducted, with other priests, to the island of Juquinoxima,\r\ndistant three leagues from Nagasaki. In August they were removed to\r\nthe prison of Ormura. On September 21, 1622, they were taken again\r\nto Nagasaki, where they were executed next day. He was beautified by\r\norder of the pope. He wrote La relación del glorioso martirio de los\r\nBB. Alonso Navarrete y Hernando Ayala de San José, a quarto of thirty\r\npages. (Reseña Biográfica, Manila, 1891.)\r\n\r\n[150] The Augustinian Diego de Guevara was born in the town of\r\nBaeza, in the province of Jaén, of a noble family. He took the\r\nhabit in Salamanca. He arrived at Manila in 1593 with twenty-four\r\nother religious of his order. In May, 1595, he was chosen sub-prior\r\nand procurator of Manila, and in June definitor and discreto [i.e.,\r\nassistant in the council] to the general chapter. He was wrecked at\r\nJapan while on his way to attend the chapter at Rome, however, and\r\nreturned to Manila with Father Juan Tamayo, his companion. After the\r\nChinese insurrection in Manila in 1603, he was sent to Spain, which\r\nhe reached by way of Rome. He remained for three years in San Felipe\r\nel Real, but was again sent (1610) to the islands, as visitor of the\r\nAugustinian province. From 1616-1621 he was bishop of Nueva Cáceres,\r\ndying in the latter year. He was the author of various Actas, which\r\nhave been used extensively by the province. (Catálogo de los Agustinos,\r\nManila, 1901.)\r\n\r\n[151] Santa Inés mentions this religious as one of those sent back\r\nto Manila by way of a Portuguese vessel about to sail to Portuguese\r\nIndia, at the time of the persecution.\r\n\r\n[152] Probably the Sibukaw.--Rizal. This tree--also spelled\r\nsibucao--grows to a height of twelve or fifteen feet. Its flowers\r\ngrow in clusters, their calyx having five sepals. The pod is woody\r\nand ensiform and contains three or four seeds, separated by spongy\r\npartition-walls. The wood is so hard that nails are made of it, while\r\nit is used as a medicine. It is a great article of commerce as a dye,\r\nbecause of the beautiful red color that it yields.\r\n\r\n[153] The Philippines then exported silk to Japan, whence today comes\r\nthe best silk.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[154] These must be the precious ancient china jars that are even\r\nyet found in the Philippines. They are dark gray in color, and are\r\nesteemed most highly by the Chinese and Japanese.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[155] From this point the Rizal edition lacks to the word and in\r\nthe second sentence following. The original reads: \"que hizieron su\r\ncamino por tierra. Entre tanto, se padecian en la nao muchas molestias,\r\nde los Iapones que auia en el puerto.\"\r\n\r\n[156] The word in the original is cabria, which signifies literally\r\nthe sheers or machine for raising a temporary mast. It is evidently\r\nused here for the mast itself.\r\n\r\n[157] Perhaps to perform the hara-kiri, which was an ancient custom\r\namong the Japanese, and consisted in the criminal's making an incision\r\nin his abdomen, and then afterward sinking the knife in his bosom,\r\nor above the clavicle, in order to run it through the heart. Then\r\nthe victim's head was cut off with a stroke of the sword.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[158] Andrea Furtado de Mendoza began his military career at the\r\nage of sixteen, when he accompanied King Sebastian on his ill-fated\r\nexpedition to Morocco. A year or two later he went to India and\r\nbecame famous by his relief of Barcelor. He had charge of many arduous\r\nposts and achieved many military and naval successes. He opposed the\r\nDutch attempts of Matelief at Malacca. In 1609, he was elected as\r\nthirty-seventh Portuguese governor of India, and filled the office\r\nwith great credit to himself and country. (Voyage of Pyrard de Laval,\r\nHakluyt Society ed., London, 1888, part i, vol. ii, p. 267, note 3.)\r\n\r\n[159] The accounts of voyages made for the Dutch East India Company\r\n(Recueil des voyages, Amsterdam, 1725) mention a town Jaffanapatan\r\nin Ceylon, evidently the Jabanapatan of our text.\r\n\r\n[160] Hernando de los Rios attributed to these wars of the Moluccas the\r\nreason why the Philippines were at first more costly than profitable to\r\nthe king, in spite of the immense sacrifices of the inhabitants in the\r\nalmost gratuitous construction of galleons, in their equipment, etc.;\r\nand in spite of the tribute, duty, and other imposts and taxes. These\r\nMolucca expeditions, so costly to the Philippines, depopulated the\r\nislands and depleted the treasury, without profiting the country at\r\nall, for they lost forever and shortly what had been won there so\r\narduously. It is also true that the preservation of the Philippines\r\nfor Spain must be attributed to the Moluccas, and one of the powerful\r\narguments presented to Felipe II as to the advisability of sustaining\r\nthose islands was for the possession of the rich spice islands.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[161] Argensola says that the following things were also sent for\r\nthis expedition: \"300 blankets from Ilocos, 700 varas of wool from\r\nCastilla, 100 sail-needles, and 30 jars of oil; while the whole cost\r\nof the fleet amounted to 22,260 pesos per month.\" The expedition,\r\nwhich was profitless, lasted six months.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[162] See VOLS. XII and XII for documents concerning the coming of\r\nthese mandarins, and the subsequent Chinese insurrection.\r\n\r\n[163] Ignacio or Iñigo de Santa Maria, of the Dominican convent of\r\nSalamanca, on arriving at the Philippines, was sent to Cagayan. He\r\nwas later elected prior of the Manila convent, and then definitor. In\r\n1603 he went to Camboja as superior of that mission. Returning thence\r\nfor more workers that same year, he died at sea. (Reseña Biográfica,\r\nManila, 1891.)\r\n\r\n[164] Diego de Soria was born in Yébenes, in the province and\r\ndiocese of Toledo, and took the Dominican habit in Ocaña. Showing\r\nsigns of a great preacher he was sent to the College of Santo Tomás\r\nin Alcalá de Henares. Thence he went to Manila in 1587 and was one\r\nof the founders of the Dominican convent in Manila, of which he was\r\nvicar-president until June 10, 1588, when he was chosen its prior in\r\nthe first provincial chapter of the Philippine province. In 1591 he\r\nwas sent to Pangasinan, where he remained until 1595, whence he was\r\nsent to Cagayan at the instance of Luis Perez Dasmariñas. In 1596,\r\nafter many successes in Cagayan, he was recalled to Manila as prior of\r\nthe convent for the second time. Shortly after he was sent to Spain\r\nand Rome as procurator. He refused the nomination to the bishopric\r\nof Nueva Cáceres, but was compelled to accept that of Nueva Segovia,\r\nand reached the islands somewhat later. In 1608 he was in Vigan,\r\nhis residence. He died in 1613 and was buried in the parish church of\r\nVigan. In 1627 his remains were removed to the Dominican convent at\r\nLallo-c, in accordance with his wishes. (Reseña Biográfica, Manila,\r\n1891.)\r\n\r\n[165] Buzeta and Bravo say that Baltasar Covarrubias was appointed\r\nto the bishopric in 1604, at which time he entered upon his duties;\r\nbut that he died in 1607 without having been consecrated.\r\n\r\n[166] Copied and condensed from Purchas: His Pilgrimes (London, 1625),\r\nbook ii, chap. iiii, pp. 55-71, \"the third circumnavigation of the\r\nglobe.\" For other accounts of Candish, see Purchas: ut supra, iv,\r\nbook vi, chap. vi, pp. 1192-1201, and chap. vii, pp. 1210-1242; Bry:\r\nCollectiones peregrinationum (Francofurti, 1625), ser. i, vol. iii,\r\npars viii, pp. 35-59; Pieter van der Aa: Zee en landreysen (Leyden,\r\n1706) xx deel, pp. 1-64; and Hakluyt's Voyages (Goldsmid ed.,\r\nEdinburgh, 1890), xvi, pp. 1-84.\r\n\r\n[167]  The area of England and Wales is 58,186 sq. mi., that of\r\nScotland, with its 787 islands, 30,417 (mainland 26,000) sq. mi.,\r\nand that of Luzón, about 41,000 sq. mi.\r\n\r\n[168] See also VOL. XI of this series.\r\n\r\n[169]  Oliver van Noordt was the first Dutch circumnavigator. For\r\nan account of the fight with the Spanish from the side of the Dutch,\r\nsee Stanley's translation of Morga, pp. 173-187.\r\n\r\n[170]  \"L'Amsterdam ... avoit été amené à Manille avec 51 morts à son\r\nbord ... que le yacht le Faucon en avoit 34 ... que le Faucon avoit\r\nété aussí emmené avec 22 morts.\"\r\n\r\n[171] Spanish accounts, some of which will be published later in this\r\nseries, relate Spielberg's bombardment of Iloilo, and his defeat,\r\nafter disembarking by Diego Quinones in 1616; while he was later\r\ncompletely defeated by Juan Ronquillo at Playa Honda, in 1617.\r\n\r\n[172] Following in a translation of the title-page of the other\r\nedition of Morga's work, which shows that a second edition of the\r\nSucesos was published in the same year as was the first. A reduced\r\nfacsimile of this title-page--from the facsimile reproduction in\r\nthe Zaragoza edition (Madrid, 1887)--forms the frontispiece to the\r\npresent volume. It reads thus: \"Events in the Philipinas Islands:\r\naddressed to Don Christoval Gomez de Sandoval y Rojas, duke de Cea,\r\nby Doctor Antonio de Morga, alcalde of criminal causes in the royal\r\nAudiencia of Nueva España, and consultor for the Holy Office of the\r\nInquisition. At Mexico in the Indias, in the year 1609.\" In the lower\r\nleft-hand corner of the engraved title appears the engraver's name:\r\n\"Samuel Estradanus, of Antwerp, made this.\"\r\n\r\n[173] The month is omitted in the text.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[174] Fray Diego Bermeo, a native of Toledo, became a Franciscan\r\nfriar; and in 1580 went to Mexico, and three years later to the\r\nPhilippines. After spending many years as a missionary in Luzón and\r\nMindoro, he was elected provincial of his order in the islands (in\r\n1599, and again in 1608). Going to Japan as commissary provincial--in\r\n1603, according to Morga, but 1604 as given by Huerta (Estado,\r\np. 446)--he was obliged by severe illness to return to Manila; he\r\ndied there on December 12, 1609.\r\n\r\n[175] Luis Sotelo, belonging to an illustrious family of Sevilla,\r\nmade his profession as a Franciscan in 1594. Joining the Philippine\r\nmission, he reached the islands in 1600; and he spent the next two\r\nyears in ministering to the Japanese near Manila, and in the study of\r\ntheir language. In 1600 he went to Japan, where he zealously engaged\r\nin missionary labors. Ten years later, he was sentenced to death for\r\npreaching the Christian religion; but was freed from this danger by\r\nMazamune, king of Boxu, who sent the Franciscan as his ambassador to\r\nRome and Madrid. Returning from this mission, Sotelo arrived in the\r\nPhilippines in 1618, and four years later resumed his missionary\r\nlabors in Japan. In 1622 he was again imprisoned for preaching,\r\nand was confined at Omura for two years, during which time he wrote\r\nseveral works, in both the Spanish and Japanese languages. Sotelo was\r\nfinally burned at the stake in Omura, August 25, 1624. See Huerta's\r\nEstado, pp. 392-394.\r\n\r\n[176] The present towns of San Nicolás, San Fernando, etc., lying\r\nbetween Binondo and the sea.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[177] This remark of Morga can be applied to many other insurrections\r\nthat occurred later--not only of Chinese, but also of natives--and\r\nprobably even to many others which, in the course of time, will be\r\ncontrived.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[178] These devices, of which certain persons always avail themselves\r\nto cause a country to rebel, are the most efficacious to bring such\r\nmovements to a head. \"If thou wishest thy neighbor's dog to become mad,\r\npublish that it is mad,\" says an old refrain.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[179] This is the famous Eng-Kang of the histories of\r\nFilipinas.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[180] The Rizal edition of Morga omits the last part of this\r\nsentence, the original of which is \"entre vnos esteros y cienagas,\r\nlugar escondido.\"\r\n\r\n[181] \"The Chinese killed father Fray Bernardo de Santo Catalina,\r\nagent of the holy office, of the order of St. Dominic ... They attacked\r\nQuiapo, and after killing about twenty people, set fire to it. Among\r\nthese they burned alive a woman of rank, and a boy.\"--Rizal. This\r\ncitation is made from Leonardo de Argensola's Conquistas de las Molucas\r\n(Madrid, 1609), a synopsis of which will follow Morga's work.\r\n\r\n[182] We are unaware of the exact location of this settlement of\r\nLaguio. It is probably the present village of Kiapo, which agrees\r\nwith the text and is mentioned by Argensola. Nevertheless, from the\r\ndescription of this settlement given by Morga (post, chapter viii)\r\nand Chirino, it can be inferred that Laguio was located on the present\r\nsite of the suburb of La Concepción. In fact, there is even a street\r\ncalled Laguio between Malate and La Ermita.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[183] \"Fine helmets were found broken in with clubs... About thirty\r\nalso escaped (among whom was Father Farfan), who were enabled to do so\r\nbecause of being in the rear, and lightly armed\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[184] Argensola says that the Chinese killed many peaceful merchants in\r\nthe parián, while others hanged themselves of their own accord. Among\r\nthese Argensola mentions General Hontay and the rich Chican--according\r\nto the relation of Fray Juan Pobre, because the latter had refused\r\nto place the famous Eng-Kang at the head of the movement.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[185] \"And they tried to persuade the natives to unite with them;\r\nbut the latter refused, and on the contrary killed as many of the\r\nSangleys as they caught\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[186] Argensola says that \"four thousand Pampangos, armed in the\r\ncustom of their country, with bows and arrows, half-pikes, shields,\r\nand long broad daggers,\" were sent by the alcalde of Pampanga to the\r\nrelief of Manila, which now needed soldiers.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[187] In this struggle many cruelties were committed and many quiet\r\nand friendly Chinese killed. Don Pedro de Acuña, who could not\r\nprevent or stifle this terrible insurrection in its beginnings, also\r\ncontributed to the horrible butcheries that ensued. \"Accordingly\r\nmany Spaniards and natives went to hunt the disbanded Sangleys,\r\nat Don Pedro's order.\" Hernando de Avalos, alcalde of La Pampanga,\r\nseized more than 400 pacific Sangleys, \"and leading them to an estuary,\r\nmanacled two and two, delivered them to certain Japanese, who killed\r\nthem. Father Fray Diego de Guevara of the order of St. Augustine, prior\r\nof Manila, who made this relation, preached to the Sangleys first,\r\nbut only five abandoned their idolatry.\" ... Would he not have done\r\nbetter to preach to Alcalde Avalos, and to remind him that he was a\r\nman? The Spanish historians say that the Japanese and Filipinos showed\r\nthemselves cruel in the killing of the Chinese. It is quite probable,\r\nconsidering the rancor and hate with which they were regarded. But\r\ntheir commanders contributed to it also by their example. It is said\r\nthat more than 23,000 Chinese were killed. \"Some assert that the number\r\nof Sangleys killed was greater, but in order that the illegality\r\ncommitted in allowing so many to enter the country contrary to the\r\nroyal prohibitions might not be known, the officials covered up or\r\ndiminished the number of those who perished\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[188] The coming of the Spaniards to the Filipinas, and their\r\ngovernment, together with the immigration of the Chinese, killed the\r\nindustry and agriculture of the country. The terrible competition\r\nof the Chinese with any individual of another race is well known,\r\nfor which reason the United States and Australia refuse to admit\r\nthem. The indolence, then, of the inhabitants of the Filipinas, is\r\nderived from the lack of foresight of the government. Argensola says\r\nthe same thing, and could not have copied Morga, since their works\r\nwere published in the same year, in countries very distant from one\r\nanother, and the two contain wide differences.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese question has always been of great importance in the\r\nPhilippines. The dislike of the Filipino for the Chinese seemed\r\ninstinctive and was deep-rooted. The subject of the Chinese immigration\r\nto the islands has served for special legislation on many occasions\r\nin Spain, but they have nevertheless persisted in their trading and\r\noccupations therein. See Stanley's edition of Morga, appendix II,\r\npp. 363-368; and Los Chinos en Filipinos (Manila, 1886).\r\n\r\n[189] This should be six hundred and four.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[190] Nueva España.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[191] This archbishop seems to have been a principal cause of the\r\ndisturbance and massacre of the Chinese, by taking a leading part in\r\nexciting suspicion against them.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[192] The Arab travelers of the ninth century mention that eunuchs\r\nwere employed in China, especially for the collection of the revenue,\r\nand that they were called thoucam.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[193] \"In earlier times a barrier, which ran from Osaka to the\r\nborder of Yamato and Omi, separated the thirty-three western from the\r\nthirty-three eastern provinces. The former were collectively entitled\r\nKuwansei (pronounce Kánsé), i.e., westward of the Gate; the latter\r\nKuwantô (pronounce Kántô), i.e., eastward of the Gate. Later, however,\r\nwhen under the Tokugawa régime the passes leading to the plain in which\r\nYedo, the new capital of Shôgune, grew up were carefully guarded;\r\nby the Gate (Kuwan) was understood the great guard on the Hakone\r\nPass, and Kuwantô or Kuwantô-Hashiu, the eight provinces east of it:\r\nSagami, Musashi, Kôtsuke, Shimotsuke, Hitachi, Shimosa, Katsusa,\r\nand Awa.\" Thus defined by Rein, in his Japan, p. II, Cf. Griffis,\r\nMikado's Empire, p. 68, note.\r\n\r\n[194] A flat-bottomed boat, capable of carrying heavy loads.\r\n\r\n[195] Pedro Alvares de Abreu.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[196] According to Argensola, who gives a succinct relation of this\r\nexpedition, the number engaged in it were as follows: Spaniards\r\nand their officers, 1,423; Pampangos and Tagáls (without their\r\nchiefs), 344; idem, for maritime and military service, 620; rowers,\r\n649; Indian chiefs, 5; total 3,041. But he adds that all those\r\nof the fleet, exclusive of the general's household and followers,\r\nnumbered 3,095. Probably the 54 lacking in the above number were the\r\nPortuguese under command of Abreu and Camelo, although Argensola\r\ndoes not mention Portuguese soldiers.... The names of the Indian\r\nchiefs attending the expedition at their own cost were: Don Guillermo\r\n(Palaot), master-of-camp; and Captains Don Francisco Palaot, Don Juan\r\nLit, Don Luis Lont, and Don Agustin Lont. These must have behaved\r\nexceedingly well, for after the assault on Ternate, Argensola says:\r\n\"Not a person of consideration among the Spaniards or the Indians\r\nremained unwounded.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[197] Said Dini Baraka ja.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[198] Combés (Mindanao, Retana's ed., cols. 73, 74) describes the\r\nbagacay as a small, slender reed, hardened in fire and sharp-pointed;\r\nit is hurled by a Moro at an enemy with unerring skill, and sometimes\r\nfive are discharged in one volley. He narrates surprising instances of\r\nthe efficacy of this weapon, and says that \"there is none more cruel,\r\nat close range.\"\r\n\r\n[199] Stanley translates this \"flat-boats.\" Retana and Pastells\r\n(Combés's Mindanao, col. 787) derive this word from Chinese chun,\r\n\"a boat,\" and regard the joanga (juanga) as a small junk.\r\n\r\n[200] \"The soldiers, having entered the city, gave themselves\r\nuniversally to violence and pillage. Don Pedro had issued a\r\nproclamation conceding that all of the enemy captured within those\r\nfour days, should be slaves\" (Argensola). During the sack, which\r\nDon Pedro was unable to restrain, neither children nor young girls\r\nwere spared. One girl was killed because two soldiers disputed for\r\nher.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[201] \"The prince's name was Sulamp Gariolano. This step was contrary\r\nto the advice of Queen Celicaya\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[202] Sangajy, a Malay title (Marsden).--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[203] The Jesuit Father Luis Fernández, Gallinato, and Esquivel\r\nmade negotiations with the king for this exile, and Father Colin\r\nattributes its good outcome to the cleverness of the former. What was\r\nthen believed to be prudent resulted afterward as an impolitic measure,\r\nand bore very fatal consequences; for it aroused the hostility of all\r\nthe Molucas, even that of their allies, and made the Spanish name\r\nas odious as was the Portuguese. The priest Hernando de los Rios,\r\nBokemeyer, and other historians, moreover, accuse Don Pedro de Acuña\r\nof bad faith in this; but, strictly judged, we believe that they do\r\nso without foundation. Don Pedro in his passport assured the lives of\r\nthe king and prince, but not their liberty. Doubtless a trifle more\r\ngenerosity would have made the conqueror greater, and the odium of\r\nthe Spanish name less, while it would have assured Spanish domination\r\nof that archipelago. The unfortunate king never returned to his own\r\ncountry. Hernando de los Rios says that during Don Pedro de Acuña's\r\nlife he was well treated, but that during the administration of Don\r\nJuan de Silva \"I have seen him in a poor lodging where all the rain\r\nfell on him, and they were starving him to death.\" He is described by\r\nArgensola as of \"robust proportions, and his limbs are well formed. His\r\nneck and much of his breast are bare. His flesh is of a cloudy color,\r\nrather black than gray. The features of his face are like those of an\r\nEuropean. His eyes are large and full, and he seems to dart sparks\r\nfrom them. His large eyelashes, his thick bristling beard, and his\r\nmustaches add to his fierceness. He always wears his campilan, dagger,\r\nand kris, both with hilts in the form of gilded serpents' heads.\" This\r\ndescription was taken from a picture sent to Spain.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[204] Other disturbances occurred also, because of Don Pedro's enemies\r\nhaving spread the news that the expedition had been destroyed, and\r\nmost of those making it killed. \"This report, having come to the ears\r\nof the Indians, was so harmful that they began to mutiny, especially\r\nin the provinces of Camarines and Pintados. The friars who instructed\r\nthem could already do, nothing with them, for they asked why, since\r\nthe inhabitants of the Malucos were victorious, should they be subject\r\nto the Spaniards, who did not defend them from the Moros. They said\r\nthat the Moros would plunder them daily with the help of Ternate,\r\nand that it would be worse henceforth\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLa Concepción states (Hist. de Philipinas, iv, p. 103) that these\r\nJapanese were settled in Dilao; and that the immediate cause of their\r\nmutiny was the killing of a Japanese by a Spaniard, in a quarrel.\r\n\r\n[205] The authors of this poisoning were then known in Manila,\r\nand according to Argensola were those envious of the governor. \"But\r\nalthough they were known as such, so that the suspicion of the crowd\r\nmakes them the authors of the poisoning we shall repress their names\r\n... for all are now dead\" (Argensola).--Rizal.\r\n\r\nCf. La Concepción (Hist. de Philipinas, iv, pp. 105, 106); he ascribes\r\nthe report of Acuña's poisoning to the physicians, who sought thus\r\nto shield their own ignorance of his disease.\r\n\r\n[206] These were the results of having taken the king and his chiefs,\r\nwho had entrusted themselves to Don Pedro de Acuña, prisoners to\r\nManila, the king of Tidore, the ally of España, had already found\r\nmeans to break the alliance. The governors appointed by the captive\r\nking refused to have anything to do with the Spaniards. Fear was\r\nrampant in all parts, and the spirit of vengeance was aroused. \"When\r\nhis vassals saw the ill-treatment that the Spaniards inflicted on\r\ntheir king, they hated us so much that they acquired an equal liking\r\nfor our enemies.

Stanley says:\r\n\"The inhabitants of the Philippines previous to the Spanish settlement\r\nwere not like the inhabitants of the great Indian Peninsula, people\r\nwith a civilization as that of their conquerors. Excepting that they\r\npossessed the art of writing, and an alphabet of their own, they do\r\nnot appear to have differed in any way from the Dayaks of Borneo as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Boyle in his recent book of adventures amongst that\r\npeople. Indeed there is almost a coincidence of verbal expressions in\r\nthe descriptions he and De Morga give of the social customs, habits,\r\nand superstitions of the two peoples they are describing; though many\r\nof these coincidences are such as are incidental to life in similar\r\ncircumstances, there are enough to lead one to suppose a community of\r\norigin of the inhabitants of Borneo and Luzon.\" Pardo de Tavera says\r\nafter quoting the first part of the above: \"Lord Stanley's opinion is\r\ndispassionate and not at all at variance with historical truth.\" The\r\nsame author says also that Blumentritt's prologue and Rizal's notes\r\nin the latter's edition of Morga have so aroused the indignation of\r\nthe Spaniards that several have even attacked Morga.]\r\n\r\n[211] More exactly from 25º 40' north latitude to 12º south latitude,\r\nif we are to include Formosa in the group, which is inhabited likewise\r\nby the same race.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[212] We confess our ignorance with respect to the origin of this\r\nbelief of Morga, which, as one can observe, was not his belief in\r\nthe beginning of the first chapter. Already from the time of Diodorus\r\nSiculus (first century B. C.), Europe received information of these\r\nislands by one Iamboule, a Greek, who went to them (to Sumatra at\r\nleast), and who wrote afterward the relation of his voyage. He gave\r\ntherein detailed information of the number of the islands, of their\r\ninhabitants, of their writing, navigation, etc. Ptolemy mentions\r\nthree islands in his geography, which are called Sindæ in the Latin\r\ntext. They are inhabited by the Aginnatai. Mercator interprets those\r\nislands as Celebes, Gilolo, and Amboina. Ptolemy also mentions the\r\nisland Agathou Daimonos (Borneo), five Baroussai (Mindanao, Leite,\r\nSebu, etc.), three Sabadeibai (the Java group--Iabadiou) and ten\r\nMasniolai where a large loadstone was found. Colin surmises that\r\nthese are the Manilas.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nColin (Labor Evangelica, Madrid, 1663) discusses the discovery and\r\nnaming of the Philippines. He quotes Ptolemy's passage that speaks\r\nof islands called the Maniolas, whence many suppose came the name\r\nManilas, sometimes given to the islands. But as pointed out in a\r\nletter dated March 14, 1904, by James A. LeRoy, Spanish writers have\r\nwasted more time on the question than it merits. Mr. LeRoy probably\r\nconjectures rightly that many old Chinese and Japanese documents will\r\nbe found to contain matter relating to the Philippines prior to the\r\nSpanish conquest.\r\n\r\n[213] It is very difficult now to determine exactly which is this\r\nisland of Tendaya, called Isla Filipina for some years. According to\r\nFather Urdaneta's relations, this island was far to the east of the\r\ngroup, past the meridian of Maluco. Mercator locates it in Panay,\r\nand Colin in Leyte, between Abuyog and Cabalían--contrary to the\r\nopinion of others, who locate it in Ibabao, or south of Samar. But\r\naccording to other documents of that period, there is no island by\r\nthat name, but a chief called Tendaya, lord of a village situated in\r\nthat district; and, as the Spaniards did not understand the Indians\r\nwell at that time, many contradictions thus arose in the relations of\r\nthat period. We see that, in Legazpi's expedition, while the Spaniards\r\ntalked of islands, the Indians talked of a man, etc. After looking\r\nfor Tandaya for ten days they had to continue without finding it\r\n\"and we passed on without seeing Tandaya or Abuyo.\" It appears,\r\nnevertheless, that the Spaniards continued to give this name to the\r\nsouthwestern part of Samar, calling the southeastern part Ibabao or\r\nZibabao and the northern part of the same island Samar.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[214] Sugbú, in the dialect of the country.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[215] Morga considers the rainy season as winter, and the rest of\r\nthe year as summer. However this is not very exact, for at Manila,\r\nin December, January, and February, the thermometer is lower than\r\nin the months of August and September. Consequently, in its seasons\r\nit is like those of España and those of all the rest of the northern\r\nhemisphere.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[216] The ancient traditions made Sumatra the original home of the\r\nFilipino Indians. These traditions, as well as the mythology and\r\ngenealogies mentioned by the ancient historians, were entirely lost,\r\nthanks to the zeal of the religious in rooting out every national pagan\r\nor idolatrous record. With respect to the ethnology of the Filipinas,\r\nsee Professor Blumentritt's very interesting work, Versuch einer\r\nEtnographie der Philippinen (Gotha, Justus Perthes, 1882).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[217] This passage contradicts the opinion referred to in Boyle's\r\nAdventures among the Dyaks of Borneo, respecting the ignorance of the\r\nDyaks in the use of the bow, which seems to imply that other South\r\nSea islanders are supposed to share this ignorance. These aboriginal\r\nsavages of Manila resemble the Pakatans of Borneo in their mode of\r\nlife.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[218] We do not know the origin of this word, which does not seem to\r\nbe derived from China. If we may make a conjecture, we will say that\r\nperhaps a poor phonetic transcription has made chinina from the word\r\ntininã (from tinã) which in Tagál signifies teñido [\"dyed stuff\"],\r\nthe name of this article of clothing, generally of but one color\r\nthroughout. The chiefs wore these garments of a red color, which made,\r\naccording to Colin, \"of fine gauze from India.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[219] Bahag \"a richly dyed cloth, generally edged with gold\" among\r\nthe chiefs.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[220] \"They wrapped it in different ways, now in the Moro style, like\r\na turban without the top part, now twisted and turned in the manner\r\nof the crown of a hat. Those who esteemed themselves valiant let the\r\nends of the cloth, elaborately embroidered, fall down the back to the\r\nbuttocks. In the color of the cloth, they showed their chieftaincy, and\r\nthe device of their undertakings and prowess. No one was allowed to use\r\nthe red potong until he had killed at least one man. And in order to\r\nwear them edged with certain edgings, which were regarded as a crown,\r\nthey must have killed seven men\" (Colin). Even now any Indian is seen\r\nto wear the balindang in the manner of the putong. Putong signifies\r\nin Tagál, \"to crown\" or \"to wrap anything around the head.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[221] This is the reading of the original (cera hilada). It seems more\r\nprobable that this should read \"spun silk,\" and that Morga's amanuensis\r\nmisunderstood seda (\"silk\") as cera (\"wax\"), or else it is a misprint.\r\n\r\n[222] \"They also have strings of bits of ivory\" (Colin).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[223] \"The last complement of the gala dress was, in the manner of our\r\nsashes, a richly dyed shawl crossed at the shoulder and fastened under\r\nthe arm\" (even today the men wear the lambong or mourning garment\r\nin this manner) \"which was very usual with them. The Bisayans, in\r\nplace of this, wore robes or loose garments, well made and collarless,\r\nreaching to the instep, and embroidered in colors. All their costume,\r\nin fact, was in the Moorish manner, and was truly elegant and rich;\r\nand even today they consider it so\" (Colin).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[224] This manner of headdress, and the long robe of the Visayans,\r\nhave an analogy with the Japanese coiffure and kimono.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[225] Barõ.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[226] A tree (Entada purseta) which grows in most of the provinces\r\nof the Philippines. It contains a sort of filament, from which is\r\nextracted a soapy foam, which is much used for washing clothes. This\r\nfoam is also used to precipitate the gold in the sand of rivers. Rizal\r\nsays the most common use is that described above.\r\n\r\n[227] This custon still exists.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[228] This custom exists also among the married women of Japan,\r\nas a sign of their chastity. It is now falling into disuse.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[229] The Filipinos were careful not to bathe at the hour of\r\nthe siesta, after eating, during the first two days of a cold,\r\nwhen they have the herpes, and some women during the period of\r\nmenstruation.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[230] This work, although not laborious, is generally performed\r\nnow by the men, while the women do only the actual cleaning of the\r\nrice.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[231] This custom is still to be seen in some parts.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[232] A name given it by the Spaniards. Its Tagál name is\r\nkanin.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[233] The fish mentioned by Morga is not tainted, but is the\r\nbagoong.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[234] A term applied to certain plants (Atmaranthus, Celosia, etc.) of\r\nwhich the leaves are boiled and eaten.\r\n\r\n[235] From the Tagál tubã, meaning sap or juice.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[236] The Filipinos have reformed in this respect, due perhaps to the\r\nwine-monopoly. Colin says that those intoxicated by this wine were\r\nseldom disagreeable or dangerous, but rather more witty and sprightly;\r\nnor did they show any ill effects from drinking it.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[237] This weapon has been lost, and even its name is gone. A proof\r\nof the decline into which the present Filipinos have fallen is the\r\ncomparison of the weapons that they manufacture now, with those\r\ndescribed to us by the historians. The hilts of the talibones now\r\nare not of gold or ivory, nor are their scabbards of horn, nor are\r\nthey admirably wrought.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nBalarao, dagger, is a Vissayan word.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[238] The only other people who now practice head-hunting are the\r\nMentenegrins.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[239] A Tagál word meaning oar.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[240] A common device among barbarous or semi-civilized peoples,\r\nand even among boatmen in general. These songs often contain many\r\ninteresting and important bits of history, as well as of legendary\r\nlore.\r\n\r\n[241] Karang, signifying awnings.--Rizal and Stanley.\r\n\r\n[242] The Filipinos, like the inhabitants of the Marianas--who are no\r\nless skilful and dexterous in navigation--far from progressing, have\r\nretrograded; since, although boats are now built in the islands,\r\nwe might assert that they are all after European models. The\r\nboats that held one hundred rowers to a side and thirty soldiers\r\nhave disappeared. The country that once, with primitive methods,\r\nbuilt ships of about 2,000 toneladas, today [1890] has to go to\r\nforeign ports, as Hong-Kong, to give the gold wrenched from the poor,\r\nin exchange for unserviceable cruisers. The rivers are blocked up,\r\nand navigation in the interior of the islands is perishing, thanks to\r\nthe obstacles created by a timid and mistrusting system of government;\r\nand there scarcely remains in the memory anything but the name of all\r\nthat naval architecture. It has vanished, without modern improvements\r\nhaving come to replace it in such proportion as, during the past\r\ncenturies, has occurred in adjacent countries....--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[243] It seems that some species of trees disappeared or became\r\nvery scarce because of the excessive ship-building that took place\r\nlater. One of them is the betis.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nBlanco states (Flora, ed. 1845, p. 281) that the betis (Azaola betis)\r\nwas common in Pampanga and other regions.\r\n\r\nDelgado describes the various species of trees in the Philippines\r\nin the first six treatises of the first part of the fourth book of\r\nHistoria general de Filipinas (Manila, 1892). He mentions by name more\r\nthan seventy trees grown on the level plains and near the shores;\r\nmore than forty fruit-trees; more than twenty-five species grown in\r\nthe mountains; sixteen that actually grow in the water; and many kinds\r\nof palms. See also Gazetteer of the Philippine Islands (Washington,\r\n1902), pp. 85-95, and Buzeta and Bravo's Diccionario (Madrid, 1850),\r\ni, pp. 29-36.\r\n\r\n[244] Sanctor is called santol (Sandoricum indicum--Cavanilles), in\r\nDelgado (ut supra, note 71). The tree resembles a walnut-tree. Its\r\nleaves are rounded and as large as the palm of the hand, and are\r\ndark green in color. Excellent preserves are made from the fruit,\r\nwhich was also eaten raw by the Indians. The leaves of the tree have\r\nmedicinal properties and were used as poultices. Mabolo (Diospyros\r\ndiscolor--Willd.) signifies in Tagál a thing or fruit enclosed in\r\na soft covering. The tree is not very high. The leaves are large,\r\nand incline to a red color when old. The fruit is red and as large\r\nas a medium-sized quince, and has several large stones. The inside of\r\nthe fruit is white, and is sweet and firm, and fragrant, but not very\r\ndigestible. The wood resembles ebony, is very lustrous, and is esteemed\r\nfor its solidity and hardness. The nanca [nangka, nangca; translated\r\nby Stanley, jack-fruit] (Artocarpus integrifolia--Willd.), was taken\r\nto the Philippines from India, where it was called yaca. The tree\r\nis large and wide-spreading, and has long narrow leaves. It bears\r\nfruit not only on the branches, but on the trunk and roots. The\r\nfruit is gathered when ripe, at which time it exhales an aromatic\r\nodor. On opening it a yellowish or whitish meat is found, which\r\nis not edible. But in this are found certain yellow stones, with a\r\nlittle kernel inside resembling a large bean; this is sweet, like\r\nthe date, but has a much stronger odor. It is indigestible, and when\r\neaten should be well masticated. The shells are used in cooking and\r\nresemble chestnuts. The wood is yellow, solid, and especially useful\r\nin making certain musical instruments. Buzeta and Bravo (Diccionario,\r\ni, p. 35) say that there are more than fifty-seven species of bananas\r\nin the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[245] Pilê (Canarium commune--Linn.). Delgado (ut supra) says that this\r\nwas one of the most notable and useful fruits of the islands. It was\r\ngenerally confined to mountainous regions and grew wild. The natives\r\nused the fruit and extracted a white pitch from the tree. The fruit\r\nhas a strong, hard shell. The fruit itself resembles an almond, both\r\nin shape and taste, although it is larger. The tree is very high,\r\nstraight, and wide-spreading. Its leaves are larger than those of\r\nthe almond-tree.\r\n\r\n[246] Delgado (ut supra) describes the tree (Cedrela\r\ntoona--Roxb.) called calanta in Tagál, and lanipga in Visayan. The tree\r\nis fragrant and has wood of a reddish color. It was used for making\r\nthe hulls of vessels, because of its strength and lightness. The same\r\nauthor describes also the asana (Pterocarpus indicus--Willd.) or as it\r\nis called in the Visayas, naga or narra--as an aromatic tree, of which\r\nthere are two varieties, male and female. The wood of the male tree is\r\npinkish, while that of the female tree is inclined to white. They both\r\ngrow to a great size and are used for work requiring large timber. The\r\nwood has good durable qualities and is very impervious to water, for\r\nwhich reason it was largely used as supports for the houses. Water\r\nin which pieces of the wood were placed, or the water that stood in\r\nvessels made of this wood, had a medicinal value in dropsy and other\r\ndiseases. In the provinces of Albay and Camarines the natives made\r\ncuriously-shaped drinking vessels from this wood.\r\n\r\n[247] So many cattle were raised that Father Gaspar de San Agustin,\r\nwhen speaking of Dumangas, says: \"In this convent we have a large ranch\r\nfor the larger cattle, of so many cows that they have at times numbered\r\nmore than thirty, thousand ... and likewise this ranch contains many\r\nfine horses.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[248] To the flesh of this fowl, called in Tagál ulikbâ, are attributed\r\nmedicinal virtues.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[249] These animals now [1890] exist in the islands, but are held in\r\nsmall esteem.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[250] See chapter on the mammals of the islands, in Report of\r\nU. S. Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 307-312. At its end is the\r\nstatement that but one species of monkey is known, and one other is\r\nreported, to exist in the Philippines; and that \"the various other\r\nspecies of monkey which have been assigned to the Philippines by\r\ndifferent authors are myths pure and simple.\"\r\n\r\n[251] Camalote, for gamalote, a plant like maize, with a leaf a yard\r\nlong and an inch wide. This plant grows to a height of two yards\r\nand a half, and when green serves for food for horses (Caballero's\r\nDictionary, Madrid, 1856).--Stanley.\r\n\r\nAt that time the name for zacate (hay).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[252] In Japanese fimbari, larks (Medhurst's Japanese\r\nVocabulary).--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[253] Pogos, from the Tagál pugô.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nDelgado (ut supra) describes the pogos as certain small gray birds,\r\nvery similar to the sparrows in Spain. They are very greedy, and if\r\nundisturbed would totally destroy the rice-fields. Their scientific\r\nname is Excalfactoria chinensis (Linn.).\r\n\r\n[254] Stanley conjectures that this word is a misprint for maynelas,\r\na diminutive of maina, a talking bird. Delgado (ut supra) describes\r\na bird called maya (Munia jagori--Cab.; Ploceus baya--Blyth.; and\r\nPloceus hypoxantha--Tand.), which resembles the pogo, being smaller\r\nand of a cinnamon color, which pipes and has an agreeable song.\r\n\r\n[255] Stanley translates this as \"wild ducks.\" Delgado (ut supra)\r\ndescribes a bird called lapay (Dendrocygna vagans--Eyton.), as similar\r\nto the duck in body, but with larger feet, which always lives in the\r\nwater, and whose flesh is edible.\r\n\r\n[256] For descriptions of the birds in the Philippines, see Delgado\r\n(ut supra) book v, part i, 1st treatise, pp. 813-853; Report of\r\nU.S. Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 312-316; and Gazetteer of\r\nthe Philippine Islands (Washington, 1902), pp. 170, 171. There are\r\nmore than five hundred and ninety species of birds in the islands, of\r\nwhich three hundred and twenty-five are peculiar to the archipelago,\r\nand largely land birds. There are thirty-five varieties of doves and\r\npigeons, all edible.\r\n\r\n[257] There are now domestic rabbits, and plenty of peacocks.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[258] Doubtless the python, which is often domesticated in the\r\nPhilippines. See VOL. XII, p. 259, note 73.\r\n\r\n[259] La Gironiére (Twenty Years in the Philippines--trans. from\r\nFrench, London, 1853) describes an interesting fight with a huge\r\ncrocodile near his settlement of Jala-Jala. The natives begged for\r\nthe flesh in order to dry it and use it as a specific against asthma,\r\nas they believed that any asthmatic person who lived on the flesh for\r\na certain time would be infallibly cured. Another native wished the\r\nfat as an antidote for rheumatic pain. The head of this huge reptile\r\nwas presented to an American, who in turn presented it to the Boston\r\nMuseum. Unfortunately La Gironiére's picturesque descriptions must\r\noften be taken with a grain of salt. For some information regarding\r\nthe reptiles of the islands see Report of U.S. Philippine Commission,,\r\n1900, iii, pp. 317-319.\r\n\r\n[260] Unless we are mistaken, there is a fish in the Filipinas called\r\nPámpano.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[261] For catalogue and scientific description of the mollusks\r\nof the Philippines, see the work of Joaquín González Hidalgo--now\r\n(1904) in course of publication by the Real Academia de Ciencias\r\nof Madrid--Estudios preliminares sobre la fauna malacológica de las\r\nIslas Filipinas.\r\n\r\n[262] The Río Grande.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[263] No fish is known answering to this description.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[264] The island of Talim.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[265] Retana thinks (Zúñiga, ii, p. 545*) that this device was\r\nintroduced among the Filipinos by the Borneans.\r\n\r\n[266] A species of fishing-net. Stanley's conjecture is wrong.\r\n\r\n[267] Esparavel is a round fishing-net, which is jerked along by\r\nthe fisher through rivers and shallow places. Barredera is a net of\r\nwhich the meshes are closer and tighter than those of common nets,\r\nso that the smallest fish may not escape it.\r\n\r\n[268] Cf. methods of fishing of North American Indians, Jesuit\r\nRelations, vi, pp. 309-311, liv, pp. 131, 306-307.\r\n\r\n[269] A species of fish in the Mediterranean, about three pulgadas\r\n[inches] long. Its color is silver, lightly specked with black.\r\n\r\n[270] The fish now called lawlaw is the dry, salted sardine. The\r\nauthor evidently alludes to the tawilis of Batangas, or to the dilis,\r\nwhich is still smaller, and is used as a staple by the natives.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nFor information regarding the fishes of the Philippines, see Delgado\r\n(ut supra), book v, part iv, pp. 909-943; Gazetteer of the Philippine\r\nIslands (ut supra), pp. 171-172; and (with description of methods of\r\nfishing) Report of U. S. Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 319-324.\r\n\r\n[271] Pahõ. A species of very small mango from one and one-half\r\nto five centimeters in its longer diameter. It has a soft pit, and\r\nexhales a strong pitchy odor.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[272] A Spanish word signifying a cryptogamous plant; perhaps referring\r\nto some species of mushroom.\r\n\r\n[273] In Tagál this is kasubhã. It comes from the Sanskrit kasumbha,\r\nor Malay kasumba (Pardo de Tavera's El Sanscrito en la lengua\r\ntagalog).--Rizal.\r\n\r\nThis plant is the safflower or bastard saffron (Certhamus tinctorius);\r\nits flowers are used in making a red dye.\r\n\r\n[274] Not a tree, but a climber. The plants are cultivated by\r\ntraining them about some canes planted in the middle of certain\r\nlittle channels which serve to convey irrigation to the plant twice\r\neach day. A plantation of betel--or ikmó, as the Tagáls call it--much\r\nresembles a German hop-garden.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[275] This fruit is not that of the betel or buyo, but of the bonga\r\n(Tagál buñga), or areca palm.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[276] Not quicklime, but well slaked lime.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nRizal misprints un poco de cal viva for vn poluc de cal viua.\r\n\r\n[277] The original word is marcada. Rizal is probably correct in\r\nregarding it as a misprint for mascada, chewed.\r\n\r\n[278] It is not clear who call these caskets by that name. I\r\nimagine it to be the Spanish name, properly spelt buxeta. The king\r\nof Calicut's betel box is called buxen in the Barcelona MS. of the\r\nMalabar coasts.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[279] See VOL. IV, p. 222, note 31; also Delgado (ut supra),\r\npp. 667-669. Delgado says that bonga signifies fruit.\r\n\r\n[280] Tagál, tukõ.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[281] This word in the original is visitandolas; Rizal makes it\r\nirritandolas (shaking or irritating them), but there are not sufficient\r\ngrounds for the change.\r\n\r\n[282] The Indians, upon seeing that wealth excited the rapacity of\r\nthe encomenderos and soldiers, abandoned the working of the mines,\r\nand the religious historians assert that they counseled them to a\r\nsimilar action in order to free them from annoyances. Nevertheless,\r\naccording to Colin (who was \"informed by well-disposed natives\")\r\nmore than 100,000 pesos of gold annually, conservatively stated,\r\nwas taken from the mines during his time, after eighty years of\r\nabandonment. According to \"a manuscript of a grave person who had\r\nlived long in these islands\" the first tribute of the two provinces\r\nof Ilocos and Pangasinan alone amounted to 109,500 pesos. A single\r\nencomendero, in 1587, sent 3,000 taheles of gold in the \"Santa Ana,\"\r\nwhich was captured by Cavendish.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[283] This was prohibited later.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[284] See VOL. XIV, pp. 301-304.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hernando de los Rios the province of Pangasinan was said\r\nto contain a quantity of gold, and that Guido de Labazaris sent some\r\nsoldiers to search for it; but they returned in a sickly state and\r\nsuppressed all knowledge of the mines in order not to be sent back\r\nthere. The Dominican monks also suppressed all knowledge of the mines\r\non account of the tyranny of which gold had been the cause in the\r\nWest Indies.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[285] Pearl-fishing is still carried on along the coasts of Mindanao\r\nand Palawan, and in the Sulu archipelago. In the latter region pearls\r\nare very abundant and often valuable; the fisheries there are under\r\nthe control of the sultan of Sulu, who rents them, appropriating for\r\nhimself the largest pearls.\r\n\r\n[286] Probably the cowry (Cypræa moneta). Crawfurd states\r\n(Dict. Ind. Islands, p. 117) that in the Asiatic archipelago this\r\nshell is found only on the shores of the Sulu group, and that it\r\n\"seems never to have been used for money among the Indian Islanders\r\nas it has immemorially been by the Hindus.\"\r\n\r\n[287] Jagor, Travels in the Philippines (Eng. trans., London, 1875),\r\ndevotes a portion of his chapter xv to these jars. He mentions the\r\ngreat prices paid by the Japanese for these vessels. On p. 164, occurs\r\na translation of the above paragraph, but it has been mistranslated\r\nin two places. Stanley cites the similar jars found among the Dyaks\r\nof Borneo--the best called gusih--which were valued at from $1,500 to\r\n$3,000, while the second grade were sold for $400. That they are very\r\nancient is proved by one found among other remains of probably the\r\ncopper age. From the fact that they have been found in Cambodia, Siam,\r\nCochinchina, and the Philippines, Rizal conjectures that the peoples\r\nof these countries may have had a common center of civilization at\r\none time.\r\n\r\n[288] \"Not many years ago,\" says Colin (1663), \"a large piece [of\r\nambergris] was found in the island of Joló, that weighed more than\r\neight arrobas, of the best kind, namely, the gray.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[289] This industry must now be forgotten, for it is never heard\r\nof.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[290] Perhaps Morga alludes to the sinamay, which was woven from abaká,\r\nor filament of the plant Musa textilis. The abaká is taken from the\r\ntrunk and not the leaf.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[291] This name seems to be Malay, Babu-utan, wild swine.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[292] The men of these islands were excellent carpenters and\r\nship-builders. \"They make many very light vessels, which they take\r\nthrough the vicinity for sale in a very curious manner. They build\r\na large vessel, undecked, without iron nail or any fastening. Then,\r\naccording to the measure of its hull, they make another vessel that\r\nfits into it. Within that they put a second and a third. Thus a large\r\nbiroco contains ten or twelve vessels, called biroco, virey, barangay,\r\nand binitan.\" These natives were \"tattooed, and were excellent rowers\r\nand sailors; and although they are upset often, they never drown.\" The\r\nwomen are very masculine. \"They do not drink from the rivers, although\r\nthe water is very clear, because it gives them nausea.... The women's\r\ncostumes are chaste and pretty, for they wear petticoats in the\r\nBisayan manner, of fine medriñaque, and lamboncillos, which resemble\r\nclose-fitting sayuelos [i.e., woolen shifts worn by certain classes\r\nof religious]. They wear long robes of the same fine medriñaque. They\r\ngather the hair, which is neatly combed, into a knot, on top of the\r\nhead, and place a rose in it. On their forehead they wear a band of\r\nvery fine wrought gold, two fingers wide. It is very neatly worked and\r\non the side encircling the head it is covered with colored taffeta. In\r\neach ear they wear three gold earrings, one in the place where Spanish\r\nwomen wear them, and two higher up. On their feet they wear certain\r\ncoverings of thin brass, which sound when they walk.\" (The citations\r\nherein are from Colin.) These islands have also retrograded.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[293] Cavite derives its name from the Tagál word cavit, a creek,\r\nor bend, or hook, for such is its form.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[294] This province had decreased so greatly in population and\r\nagriculture, a half century later, that Gaspar de San Agustin said:\r\n\"Now it no longer has the population of the past, because of the\r\ninsurrection of that province, when Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara\r\nwas governor of these islands, and because of the incessant cutting\r\nof the timber for the building of his Majesty's ships, which prevents\r\nthem from cultivating their extremely fertile plain.\" Later, when\r\nspeaking of Guagua or Wawà, he says: \"This town was formerly very\r\nwealthy because of its many chiefs, and because of the abundant\r\nharvests gathered in its spacious plains, which are now submerged by\r\nthe water of the sea.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[295] Now the port of Sorsogón.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[296] Now the port of Mariveles (?).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[297] Subik (?).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[298] Mindoro is at present [1890] so depopulated that the minister of\r\nthe Colonies, in order to remedy this result of Spanish colonization,\r\nwishes to send there the worst desperadoes of the peninsula, to see\r\nif great criminals will make good colonists and farmers. All things\r\nconsidered, given the condition of those who go, it is indubitable\r\nthat the race that succeeds must know how to defend itself and live,\r\nso that the island may not be depopulated again.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[299] Samar. This proves contrary to the opinion of Colin, who places\r\nTendaya in Leite.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[300] Southeastern part of Samar.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[301] Colin says, however, that they did tattoo the chins and\r\nabout the eyes [barbas y cejas]. The same author states also that\r\nthe tattooing was done little by little and not all at once. \"The\r\nchildren were not tattooed, but the women tattooed one hand and\r\npart of the other. In this island of Manila the Ilocos also tattooed\r\nthemselves, although not so much as did the Visayans.\" The Negritos,\r\nIgorrotes, and other independent tribes of the Filipinas still tattoo\r\nthemselves. The Christians have forgotten the practice. The Filipinas\r\nused only the black color, thus differing from the Japanese, who\r\nemploy different colors, as red and blue, and carry the art to a\r\nrare perfection. In other islands of the Pacific, the women tattoo\r\nthemselves almost as much as the men. Dr. Wilhelm Joest's Tätowiren\r\nNarbenzeichnen und Körperbemahlen (Berlin, 1887) treats the matter\r\nvery succinctly.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[302] This is a confused statement, after what just precedes it and\r\naccording to the evidence of Father Chirino (see VOL. XII, chapter\r\nvii). Morga must mean that they wore no cloak or covering when they\r\nwent outside the house, as did the Tagáls (both men and women),\r\nwho used a kind of cape.--Rizal. [This is the sense in which Stanley\r\nunderstood and translated this passage.]\r\n\r\n[303] Gûbat, grove, field, in Tagál. Mangubat [so printed in the text\r\nof Rizal's edition] signifies in Tagál \"to go hunting, or to the wood,\"\r\nor even \"to fight.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[304] \"At the arrival of the Spaniards at this island (Panay)\" says\r\nSan Agustín, \"it was said to have more than 50,000 families. But\r\nthey decreased greatly ... and at present it has about 14,000\r\ntributarios--6,000 apportioned to the crown, and 8,000 to individual\r\nencomenderos.\" They had many gold-mines, and obtained gold by\r\nwashing the sand in the Panay River; \"but instigated by the outrages\r\nreceived from the alcaldes-mayor,\" says the same historian, \"they\r\nhave ceased to dig it, preferring to live in poverty than to endure\r\nsuch troubles.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[305] This entire paragraph is omitted in the Rizal edition. In the\r\noriginal it is as follows:\r\n\r\nLa Lengua de todos, los Pintados y Bicayas, es vna mesma, por do se\r\nentienden, hablando y escriuiendo, en letras y caratores que tienen\r\nparticulares, que semejan á los Arabigos, y su comun escribir entre\r\nlos naturales, es en hojas de arboles, y en cañas, sobre la corteza;\r\nque en todas las islas ay muchas, de disforme grueso los cañutos,\r\ny el pie es vn arbol muy grueso y maciço.\r\n\r\n[306] This difference is no greater than that between the Spanish,\r\nPortuguese, and Italian.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[307] See Chirino (Relacion de las islas Filipinas) VOL. XII, chapters\r\nxv-xvii. His remarks, those of Morga, and those of other historians\r\nargue a considerable amount of culture among the Filipino peoples prior\r\nto the Spanish conquest. A variety of opinions have been expressed\r\nas to the direction of the writing. Chirino, San Antonio, Zúñiga,\r\nand Le Gentil, say that it was vertical, beginning at the top. Colin,\r\nEzguerra, and Marche assert that it was vertical but in the opposite\r\ndirection. Colin says that the horizontal form was adopted after\r\nthe arrival of the Spaniards. Mas declares that it was horizontal\r\nand from left to right, basing his arguments upon certain documents\r\nin the Augustinian archives in Manila. The eminent Filipino scholar,\r\nDr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera has treated the subject in a work entitled\r\n\"Contribucion para el estudio de los antiguos alfabetos filipinos\"\r\n(Losana, 1884). See Rizal's notes on p. 291 of his edition of Morga.\r\n\r\n[308] This portion of this sentence is omitted in Stanley.\r\n\r\n[309] Báhay is \"house\" in Tagál; pamamáhay is that which is in the\r\ninterior and the house. Bahandin may be a misprint for bahayín,\r\nan obsolete derivative.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[310] Cf. this and following sections with Loarca's relation, VOL. V,\r\nof this series; and with Plasencia's account, VOL. VII, pp. 173-196.\r\n\r\n[311] Timawá.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[312] The condition of these slaves was not always a melancholy\r\none. Argensola says that they ate at the same table with their masters,\r\nand married into their families. The histories fail to record the\r\nassassination for motives of vengeance of any master or chief by\r\nthe natives, as they do of encomenderos. After the conquest the evil\r\ndeepened. The Spaniards made slaves without these pretexts, and without\r\nthose enslaved being Indians of their jurisdiction--going moreover,\r\nto take them away from their own villages and islands. Fernando de los\r\nRios Coronel, in his memorial to the king (Madrid, 1621) pp. 24-25,\r\nspeaks in scathing terms of the cruelties inflicted on the natives\r\nin the construction of ships during the governorship of Juan de\r\nSilva. A letter from Felipe II to Bishop Domingo de Salazar shows\r\nthe awful tyranny exercised by the encomenderos upon the natives,\r\nwhose condition was worse than that of slaves.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[313] For remarks on the customs formerly observed by the natives of\r\nPampanga in their suits, see appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n[314] This fundamental agreement of laws, and this general uniformity,\r\nprove that the mutual relations of the islands were widespread, and the\r\nbonds of friendship more frequent than were wars and quarrels. There\r\nmay have existed a confederation, since we know from the first\r\nSpaniards that the chief of Manila was commander-in-chief of the\r\nsultan of Borneo. In addition, documents of the twelfth century that\r\nexist testify the same thing.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[315] This word must be sagigilid in its Tagál form. The root gílid\r\nsignifies in Tagál, \"margin,\" \"strand,\" or \"shore.\" The reduplication\r\nof the first syllable, if tonic, signifies active future action. If\r\nnot tonic and the suffix an be added, it denotes the place where the\r\naction of the verb is frequently executed. The preposition sa indicates\r\nplace, time, reference. The atonic reduplication may also signify\r\nplurality, in which case the singular noun would be sagílid, i.e.,\r\n\"at the margin,\" or \"the last\"--that is, the slave. Timawá signifies\r\nnow in Tagál, \"in peace, in quietness, tranquil, free,\" etc. Maginoo,\r\nfrom the root ginoo, \"dignity,\" is now the title of the chiefs; and\r\nthe chief's reunion is styled kaginoóhan. Colin says, nevertheless,\r\nthat the Chiefs used the title gat or lakan, and the women dayang. The\r\ntitle of mama applied now to men, corresponds to \"uncle,\" \"Señor,\"\r\n\"Monsieur,\" \"Mr.,\" etc.; and the title al of women to the feminine\r\ntitles corresponding to these.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[316] Namamahay (from bahay, \"house\"), \"he who lives in his own\r\nhouse.\" This class of slaves, if they may be so called, exists even\r\nyet. They are called kasamá (because of being now the laborers of\r\na capitalist or farmer), bataan (\"servant,\" or \"domestic\"), kampon,\r\ntao, etc.\r\n\r\n[317] This class of slavery still exists [1890] in many districts,\r\nespecially in the province of Batangas; but it must be admitted that\r\ntheir condition is quite different from that of the slave in Greece or\r\nRome, or that of the negro, and even of those made slaves formerly by\r\nthe Spaniards. Thanks to their social condition and to their number in\r\nthat time, the Spanish domination met very little resistance, while\r\nthe Filipino chiefs easily lost their independence and liberty. The\r\npeople, accustomed to the yoke, did not defend the chiefs from\r\nthe invader, nor attempt to struggle for liberties that they never\r\nenjoyed. For the people, it was only a change of masters. The nobles,\r\naccustomed to tyrannize by force, had to accept the foreign tyranny,\r\nwhen it showed itself stronger than their own. Not encountering love\r\nor elevated feelings in the enslaved mass, they found themselves\r\nwithout force or power.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[318] Inasawa, or more correctly asawa (consort).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[319] This dowry, if one may call it so, represented to the parents\r\nan indemnity for the care and vigilance that they had exercised in\r\ntheir daughter's education. The Filipina woman, never being a burden\r\nto any one (either to her parents or to her husband), but quite the\r\ncontrary, represents a value, whose loss to the possessor must be\r\nsubstituted.... The Tagál wife is free, and treated with consideration;\r\nshe trades and contracts, almost always with the approbation of her\r\nhusband, who consults her in all his acts. She takes care of the money,\r\nand educates the children, half of whom belong to her...--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[320] Bigay-káya, \"to give what one can,\" \"a voluntary offering,\r\na present of good will\" ... This bigay-káya devolved entire to\r\nthe married couple, according to Colin, if the son-in-law was\r\nobedient to his parents-in-law; if not, it was divided among all the\r\nheirs. \"Besides the dowry, the chiefs used to give certain gifts to\r\nthe parents and relatives, and even to the slaves, which were great\r\nor less according to the rank of the one married.\" (Colin).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[321] This good custom still exists, ... although it is gradually\r\npassing away.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[322] Such is the law throughout most parts of Asia; in Siam the\r\nwoman becomes free without having children. It is only in America that\r\nfathers could and did sell their own children into slavery.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[323] This condition of affairs and the collection of usury is true\r\nstill [1890]. Morga's words prove true not only of the Indian, but also\r\nof the mestizos, the Spaniards, and even of various religious. So far\r\nhas it gone that the government itself not only permits it, but also\r\nexacts the capital and even the person to pay the debts of others,\r\nas happens with the cabeza de barangay [head of a barangay].--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[324] The tam-tam and the pum-piang are still used.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[325] The early Filipinos had a great horror of theft, and even the\r\nmost anti-Filipino historian could not accuse them of being a thievish\r\nrace. Today, however, they have lost their horror of that crime. One\r\nof the old Filipino methods of investigating theft was as follows:\r\n\"If the crime was proved, but not the criminal, if more than one was\r\nsuspected ... each suspect was first obliged to place a bundle of\r\ncloth, leaves, or whatever he wished on a pile, in which the thing\r\nstolen might be hidden. Upon the completion of this investigation\r\nif the stolen property was found in the pile, the suit ceased.\" The\r\nFilipinos also practiced customs very similar to the \"judgments of\r\nGod\" of the middle ages, such as putting suspected persons, by pairs,\r\nunder the water and adjudging guilty him who first emerged.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[326] The Filipino today prefers a beating to scoldings or\r\ninsults.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[327] From bago, new, and tao, man: he who has become a man.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[328] In speaking of a similar custom in Australia, Eyre (Central\r\nAustralia, i, p. 213), says: \"This extraordinary and inexplicable\r\ncustom must have a great tendency to prevent the rapid increase of\r\nthe population.\"--Stanley. [Stanley does not translate this paragraph\r\nof the text.]\r\n\r\n[329] It appears that the natives called anito a tutelary genius,\r\neither of the family, or extraneous to it. Now, with their new\r\nreligious ideas, the Tagáls apply the term anito to any superstition,\r\nfalse worship, idol, etc.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[330] Others besides Morga mention oratories in caves, where the idols\r\nwere kept, and where aromatics were burned in small brasiers. Chirino\r\nfound small temples in Taitay adjoining the principal houses. [See\r\nVOL. XII. of this series, chapter xxi.] It appears that temples were\r\nnever dedicated to bathala maykapal, nor was sacrifice ever offered\r\nhim. The temples dedicated to the anito were called ulañgo.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[331] San Agustín says that hell was called solad, and paradise,\r\nkalualhatian (a name still in existence), and in poetical language,\r\nulugan. The blest abodes of the inhabitants of Panay were in the\r\nmountain of Madias.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[332] Cf. the \"wake\" of the Celtic and Gaelic peasants. Cf. also the\r\nNorth-American Indian burial ceremonies, and reverence paid to the\r\ndead, in Jesuit Relations, i, p. 215; ii, pp. 21, 149; viii, p. 21;\r\nx, pp. 169, 247, 283-285, 293; xiii, 259; xxi, 199; xxiii, 31; lxv,\r\n141; etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Filipino burials, there were mourners who composed panegyrics\r\nin honor of the dead, like those made today. \"To the sound of this\r\nsad music the corpse was washed, and perfumed with storax, gum-resin,\r\nor other perfumes made from tree gums, which are found in all these\r\nwoods. Then the corpse was shrouded, being wrapped in more or less\r\ncloth according to the rank of the deceased. The bodies of the more\r\nwealthy were anointed and embalmed in the manner of the Hebrews,\r\nwith aromatic liquors, which preserved them from decay.... The\r\nburial-place of the poor was in pits dug in the ground under their\r\nown houses. After the bodies of the rich and powerful were kept and\r\nbewailed for three days, they were placed in a chest or coffin of\r\nincorruptible wood, adorned with rich jewels, and with small sheets\r\nof gold in the mouth and over the eyes. The coffin was all in one\r\npiece, and the lid was so adjusted that no air could enter. Because\r\nof these precautions the bodies have been found after many years,\r\nstill uncorrupted. These coffins were deposited in one of three\r\nplaces, according to the inclination and arrangement of the deceased,\r\neither on top of the house among the treasures ... or underneath it,\r\nbut raised from the ground; or in the ground itself, in an open hole\r\nsurrounded with a small railing ... nearby they were wont to place\r\nanother box filled with the best clothes of the deceased; and at\r\nmeal-time they set various articles of food there in dishes. Beside\r\nthe men were laid their weapons, and beside the women their looms or\r\nother implements of work\" (Colin).--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[333] Kasis. This is another instance of the misapplication of this\r\nArabic term, which means exclusively a Christian priest.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[334] This custom has not fallen into disuse among the Filipinos,\r\neven among the Catholics.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Charles Norton Barney, of the medical department of the\r\nU. S. Army, has an article in Journal of the Association of Military\r\nSurgeons for September, 1903, on \"Circumcision and Flagellation\r\namong the Filipinos.\" In regard to circumcision he states that\r\nit \"is a very ancient custom among the Philippine indios, and so\r\ngeneralized that at least seventy or eighty per cent of males in the\r\nTagál country have undergone the operation.\" Those uncircumcised at\r\nthe age of puberty are taunted by their fellows, and such are called\r\n\"suput,\" a word formerly meaning \"constricted\" or \"tight,\" but now\r\nbeing extended to mean \"one who cannot easily gain entrance in sexual\r\nintercourse.\" The \"operation has no religious significance,\" nor is\r\nit done for cleanliness, \"but from custom and disinclination to be\r\nridiculed,\" probably [as Morga proves] having been learned from the\r\nMoros. The friars were unable to check the custom. Among the Tagáls\r\nthe operation is called \"tuli,\" and the method of circumcising is\r\ndescribed at length. The author derives his information from a mestizo\r\nand a full-blooded native. The custom is mentioned by Foreman.\r\n\r\n[335] Appellation given to their ecclesiastical sages by Mahometans.\r\n\r\n[336] See the king's decree granting this coat-of-arms, in VOL. IX,\r\npp. 211-215, with two representations of the coat-of-arms.\r\n\r\n[337] Convents occupy almost one-third part of the walled city.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[338] The walls did not even have any moats then; these were dug after\r\nthe English invasion of 1762. The walls were also rearranged at that\r\ntime, and perfected with the lapse of time and the needs that arose\r\nin the city.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[339] Rizal misprints al cabo del lienço as al campo del lienzo.\r\n\r\n[340] Now [1890] the gates of the city are open all night, and in\r\ncertain periods, passage along the streets and through the walls is\r\nallowed at all hours.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[341] This powder-mill has several times changed its site. It was\r\nafterward near Maalat on the seashore, and then was moved to Nagtahá,\r\non the bank of the Pasig.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[342] Probably on the same site where the great Tagál cannon-foundry\r\nhad formerly stood, which was burned and destroyed by the Spaniards\r\nat their first arrival in Manila. San Agustin declares the Tagál\r\nfoundry to have been as large as that at Málaga.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[343] The Rizal edition omits the words, muy grande y autorizada,\r\ncapilla aparte, camara del sello real.\r\n\r\n[344] The treasury building. The governor's palace was destroyed\r\nin 1863.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[345] The Audiencia and cabildo buildings were also destroyed, but\r\nthe latter has been rebuilt.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[346] The Rizal edition misprints sacristan as sacristías.\r\n\r\n[347] This is the largest convent in Manila.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[348] Among the Jesuits, that part of a college where the pensioners\r\nor boarders live and receive their instruction.\r\n\r\n[349] This college of San José was founded in 1601, although the royal\r\ndecree for it had been conceded in 1585. The number of collegiates to\r\nenter was thirteen, among whom was a nephew of Francisco Tello and\r\na son of Dr. Morga. From its inception Latin was taught there. In\r\na suit with the College of Santo Tomás, the Jesuits obtained a\r\nfavorable decision; and it was recognized as the older institution,\r\nand given the preference in public acts. The historians say that at\r\nits inauguration the students wore bonnets covered with diamonds and\r\npearls. At present [1890] this college, after having moved from house\r\nto house, has become a school of pharmacy attached to Santo Tomás,\r\nand directed by the Dominican rector.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[350] After many varying fortunes, this institution has wholly\r\ndisappeared.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[351] The Confraternity of Mercy [Hermandad de la Misericordia]\r\nwas founded in 1594, by an ecclesiastic named Juan Fernández de\r\nLeón.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[352] San Juan de Dios [St. John of God].--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[353] Better, Maalat. The Spaniards pronounced this later\r\nMalate. There lived the chief Tagáls after they were deprived of\r\ntheir houses in Manila, among whom were the families of Raja Matanda\r\nand Raja Soliman. San Augustín says that even in his day many of the\r\nancient nobility dwelt there, and that they where very urbane and\r\ncultured. \"The Men hold various positions in Manila, and certain\r\noccupations in some of the local public functions. The women make\r\nexcellent lace, in which they are so skilfull that the Dutch women\r\ncannot surpass them.\" This is still true of the women.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[354] Now the town of Paco.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[355] Recopilación de leyes, lib. ii, tit. xv, ley xi, defines the\r\ndistrict of the Audiencia and states certain perogatives of the\r\ngovernor and auditors as follows: \"In the city of Manila, in the\r\nisland of Luzon, capital of the Felipinas, shall reside our royal\r\nAudiencia and Chancillería, with a president who shall be governor and\r\ncaptain-general, four auditors, who shall also be alcaldes of criminal\r\ncases, one fiscal, one alguacil-mayor, one lieutenant of the grand\r\nchancillor, and the other ministers and officials necessary. It shall\r\nhave as its district the said island of Luzon, and all the rest of the\r\nFilipinas, the archipelago of China and its mainland as yet discovered\r\nand to be discovered.

In things and matters of importance that arise in\r\nthe government, the said president governor shall discuss them with\r\nthe auditors of the said Audiencia, so that they, after consulting,\r\nmay give him their opinion.

We retain the above terms as expressing the persons who\r\nheld these prebends.\r\n\r\n[357] Literaly, the original translates \"in the islands of Sebu,\r\nCagayan, and Camerines.\"\r\n\r\n[358] This is so changed now [1890] and the employees so increased in\r\nnumber, that the annual expenses amount to more than 2,000,000 pesos,\r\nwhile the intendant's salary is 12,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[359] This city has disapeared from the map and from the earth. An\r\ninconsiderable town named Lal-ló occupies its site. It is still\r\n[1890], however, named as the appointment of the bishopric of Bigan,\r\nthe actual residence of the bishop.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[360] An attempt was made to supply the lack of prebends in the\r\ncathedral cities of the Philippines by the following law: \"Inasmuch\r\nas the bishops of the churches of Nueva Cáceres, Nueva Segovia,\r\nand of the Name of Jesus of the Filipinas Islands should have men\r\nto assist them in the pontifical acts, and the bishops should have\r\nall the propriety possible in their churches, and divine worship\r\nmore reverence; and inasmuch as there are no tithes with which a\r\nfew prebendaries can be sustained in the churches: therefore our\r\ngovernor of those islands shall appoint to each of the said churches\r\ntwo ecclesiastics of good life and example, who shall aid and assist\r\nthe bishop in the pontifical acts, and in all else relating to divine\r\nworship. He shall assign them a certain modest sum for their support\r\nfrom our royal treasury, so that with that they may for the present\r\nserve the churches, until there be more opportunity for endowing them\r\nwith prebendaries and providing other necessary things.\" Felipe III,\r\nSan Lorenzo, October 5, 1606. Recopilación de leyes, lib. i, tit. vi,\r\nley xviii.\r\n\r\n[361] The Rizal edition omits a considerable portion of this\r\nparagraph. The omission is as follows: para guarda del puerto, y\r\ndefensa de la ciudad, con bastante guarnicion de soldados de paga, a\r\norden del alcalde mayor, capitan a guerra de la prouincia que reside\r\nen la ciudad. Sera la poblazon, de dozientos vezinos Españoles,\r\ncon casas de madera, tiene Cabildo, de dos alcaldes ordinarios,\r\nocho rejidores, alguazil mayor y sus oficiales.\r\n\r\n[362] Now [1890] of slight importance. Of its former grandeur there\r\nremain only 1,000 inhabitants, with a parochial house, a justice's\r\nhouse, a prison, and a primary school.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[363] Vigan or Bigan.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[364] Legazpi also had two secular priests, Juan de Vivero and Juan\r\nde Villanueva, who had part in the first conversions.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[365] The Jesuits preceded the Dominicans seven years as missionaries\r\nto the Filipinas. The first Jesuits came over with Domingo de Salazar,\r\nthe first bishop, and his Dominican associate.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[366] Visita: here meaning a district which has no resident missionary,\r\nbut is visited by religious from some mission station, on which the\r\nvisita is therefore dependent.\r\n\r\n[367] Cf. with the musical ability of the Filipinos that displayed\r\nby the North American Indians, as described in The Jesuit Relations,\r\nvols. vi, p. 183; xviii, p. 161; xxiii, p. 213; xxvii, p. 117; xxxi,\r\np. 219; xxxviii, pp. 259, 263; etc.\r\n\r\n[368] Chirino (chapter vii) mentions the apportionment, by the\r\nking, of distinct districts to the different orders. The Augustinian\r\nauthorities in Mexico granted permission to those of their order going\r\nto the Philippines to establish themselves wherever they wished in\r\nthe islands (see VOL. II, pp. 161-168), and the latter exercised the\r\nomnimodo [i.e., entire] ecclesiastical authority, as conceded by the\r\npopes, until the arrival of the Franciscans in 1577. Papal concessions\r\nprobably marked out the districts as apportioned by the king.\r\n\r\n[369] Morga refers, with his characteristic prudence, to the great\r\nquestion of diocesan visits, which commenced with Fray Domingo\r\nde Salazar, and which could not be ended until 1775, in the time\r\nof Anda--thanks to the energy of the latter and the courage of\r\nArchbishop Don Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Rufina, when after\r\ngreat disturbances they succeeded in subjecting the regular curas to\r\nthe inspection of the bishops. Morga, however, shows that he did not\r\napprove the claims of the religious to independence, but does not\r\ndare to state so distinctly.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[370] The Augustinians received also one-fourth part of the tribute\r\nfrom the villages while they were building churches; and 200 pesos\r\nfuertes [i.e., ten-real pieces] and 200 cavans [the cavan equals 25\r\ngantas, or 137 Spanish libras] of cleaned rice for four religious\r\nwho heard confessions during Lent. Fifty cavans of cleaned rice per\r\nperson seems to us too much. It results that each friar consumes 12\r\n1/2 libras of rice or 27 chupas [the chupa is 1/8 ganta or 3 litros]\r\ndaily, thirteen times as much as any Indian.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[371] Recopilación de leyes, lib. vi, tit. vii, ley xvi, contains the\r\nfollowing in regard to the native chiefs: \"It is not right that the\r\nIndian chiefs of Filipinas be in a worse condition after conversion;\r\nrather should they have such treatment that would gain their affection\r\nand keep them loyal, so that with the spiritual blessings that God\r\nhas communicated to them by calling them to His true knowledge,\r\nthe temporal blessings may be joined, and they may live contentedly\r\nand comfortably. Therefore, we order the governors of those islands\r\nto show them good treatment and entrust them, in our name, with the\r\ngovernment of the Indians, of whom they were formerly the lords. In\r\nall else the governors shall see that the chiefs are benefited justly,\r\nand the Indians shall pay them something as a recognition, as they did\r\nduring the period of their paganism, provided it be without prejudice\r\nto the tributes that are to be paid us, or prejudicial to that which\r\npertains to their encomenderos.\" Felipe II, Madrid, June 11, 1594.\r\n\r\n[372] The gobernadorcillo [\"little or petty governor\"].\r\n\r\n[373] Bilangõ signifies today in Tagál \"the act of imprisoning,\"\r\nand bilanguan \"the prison.\"--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[374] For good expositions of local government in modern times, see\r\nBowring, Visit to the Philippine Isles (London, 1859), pp. 87-93;\r\nand Montero y Vidal, Archipiélago Filipino (Madrid, 1886), pp. 162-168.\r\n\r\n[375] These are now [1890] made in Spanish.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[376] Names of petty officers: the former the name of an\r\nofficer in oriental countries; the second signifying one who\r\ncommands. Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera (Costumbres de los Tagalos,\r\nMadrid, 1892, p. 10, note 1) says the word dato is now unused by the\r\nTagáls. Datu or datuls primitively signified \"grandfather,\" or \"head\r\nof the family,\" which was equivalent to the head of the barangay. This\r\nname is used in Mindanao and Joló to designate certain chiefs.\r\n\r\n[377] A later law in Recopilación de leyes (lib. vi, tit. viii, ley\r\nxi) regulates the encomienda--giving power as follows: \"The governor\r\nand captain-general of Filipinas shall apportion the encomiendas,\r\nin accordance with the regulations to worthy persons, without having\r\nother respect than to the service of God our Lord, and our service,\r\nthe welfare of the public cause, and the remuneration of the most\r\ndeserving. Within sixty days, reckoned from the time that he shall\r\nhave heard of the vacancy, he shall be obliged to apportion them. If\r\nhe does not do so, the right to apportion them shall devolve upon\r\nand pertain to our royal Audiencia of those islands, and we order\r\nthe Audiencia to apportion them, paying heed to the laws, within six\r\ndays, and to avail itself of the edicts and diligences issued by the\r\ngovernor without other new ones. In case the governor shall not have\r\nissued edicts and diligences, the Audiencia shall issue them and make\r\nthe provision within twenty days.\" Felipe III, Madrid, June 4, 1620.\r\n\r\n[378] The rapidity with which many of these encomenderos amassed\r\ngreat wealth in a few years is known, and that they left colossal\r\nfortunes at their death. Some were not satisfied with the tributes\r\nand with what they demanded, but made false measures, and balances\r\nthat weighed twice as much as was indicated. They often exacted the\r\ntributes in certain products only, and appraised the same at what\r\nvalue they wished.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[379] A law in Recopilación de leyes (lib. vi, tit. v, ley lxv)\r\ncites the above provision and confirms it anew: \"In order to provide\r\ninstruction for certain villages of the Filipinas Islands, which did\r\nnot enjoy it, or if they had it, it was not sufficient, it was resolved\r\nto increase the tribute, which was formerly eight reals, or its value,\r\nper peso, to the proportion of ten Castilian reals apiece. It was\r\nordered that the increased amount be placed in our royal treasury,\r\nand one-half real of it be applied to paying the obligations which had\r\nto be met in regard to the tithes, while the one and one-half reals\r\nwould remain to pay those soldiers there and for other purposes;\r\nin consideration of the fact that the funds necessary to send out\r\nreligious, who are employed in the preaching of the holy gospel,\r\nare supplied from our royal treasury, and that the encomenderos were\r\nobliged to pay for the ordinary instruction from the eight reals,\r\nand the part of the building of churches that fell to their share,\r\nwhile the Indians had the choice of paying all the tribute in money\r\nor in products, or in both. Thus was it enacted and voted. We order\r\nno innovation to be made in this regard, in consideration of the\r\nwelfare and conservation of those provinces and their natives, and\r\nso that the choice of paying in money shall not occasion any lack of\r\nproducts and cause sterility.\" Felipe II, San Lorenzo, August 1589;\r\nFelipe III, Zamora, February 16, 1602.\r\n\r\n[380] The following law regulates supervision of the accounts of this\r\nfund: \"Inasmuch as, when any encomienda of the Filipinas Islands\r\nhappens to be without instruction, the fourth part of the tribute\r\ncollected by the encomendero is deposited in a box with three keys, in\r\norder that it may be converted into benefices for the Indians; and as\r\nit is advisable that that ordinance be executed sensibly and properly,\r\nand that we should know the amount of it and how it is apportioned:\r\ntherefore, we order our presidents, the governors of the Filipinas\r\nIslands, that whenever they deem it advisable to examine the account,\r\nthey shall appoint for that purpose one of the officials of our royal\r\ntreasury of those islands--the one most suitable for it--who shall\r\nexamine them. The fiscal of our royal Audiencia shall investigate\r\nthem before they are finished; and shall ask and see that they\r\nare executed with the care that the matter requires in regard to\r\ntheir items, charges, articles, and balances, and whatever else is\r\nadvisable. He shall advise our president and governor of it all, so\r\nthat he may assist him in what may be necessary, and advise us of the\r\nresult.\" Felipe III, Madrid, June 4, 1620, in Recopilación de leyes,\r\nlib. i, tit. xiii, ley xiv.\r\n\r\n[381] The bull here referred to was issued by Gregory XIV, and dated\r\nApril 18, 1591. The seventh section reads as follows: \"Finally,\r\nsince, as we have learned, our very dear son in Christ, Philip,\r\nCatholic King of the Spains, on account of the many deceits wont to\r\nbe practised therein, has forbidden any Spaniard in the aforesaid\r\nPhilippine Islands to dare to take, or have, or hold any slaves,\r\nor servants, even by right of just and unjust war, or of purchase,\r\nor by whatsoever other title, or pretext; although some, despite the\r\nedict, or mandate, of King Philip himself, still keep the same slaves\r\nin their power: therefore in order that, as is befitting to reason\r\nand equity, the Indians themselves may freely and safely without\r\nany fear of bondage come and go to their Christian doctrinas, and to\r\ntheir own homes and possessions, we order and command all and singular\r\nthe persons living in the same islands, of whatsoever state, degree,\r\ncondition, order, and rank they may be, in virtue of holy obedience and\r\nunder pain of excommunication, on the publication of these presents,\r\nin accordance with the edict, or mandate of the said King Philip,\r\nto release wholly free, without deceit and guile, whatsoever Indian\r\nslaves and servants they may have, or hold; nor ever for the future\r\nin any manner to take or keep captives, or servants.\"--[Translated\r\nfrom the original by REV. T. C. MIDDLETON, O.S.A.]\r\n\r\n[382] This [1890] has disappeared from legislation, although the\r\npersonal services for España are still continued, and are fifteen\r\ndays.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[383] Recopilación de leyes, lib. vi, tit. xii, ley xii, treating of\r\npersonal services, reads as follows: \"The religious and the ministers\r\nof the instruction, and the alcaldes-mayor of the Filipinas Islands\r\nhave a weekly repartimiento of Indians which they call tanores, so\r\nthat the Indians may serve them without pay; and besides the villages\r\ncontribute to them the fish necessary to them on Fridays, which is\r\nagainst reason and justice. We order the governor and captain-general,\r\nthe Audiencia, and any other of our justices, to stop and not allow\r\nthis personal service and contribution, so that the villages shall\r\nin no manner perform it, and we declare the villages free from any\r\nobligation that they have or may have.\" This law is dated Madrid,\r\nMarch 17, 1608.\r\n\r\n[384] Taal was one of the villages where the most rigging was made\r\nfor the royal ships.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[385] This word reales is omitted in the Rizal edition.\r\n\r\n[386] A comparatively early law (Recopilación de leyes, lib. vi,\r\ntit. i, ley xv), prohibits the forcible removal of the natives for\r\nexpeditions of conquest from one island to another. It is as follows:\r\n\"We order that the Indians in the Filipinas Islands be not taken\r\nfrom one island to another forcibly in order to make incursions, and\r\nagainst their will, unless it be under very necessary circumstances,\r\nand paying them for their work and trouble. They shall be well treated\r\nand receive no injury.\" Felipe II, Madrid, November 7, 1574.\r\n\r\n[387] In Java also the Dutch restrict Europeans from roaming about\r\nthe country; this is a good regulation for the protection of the\r\ninhabitants.--Stanley.\r\n\r\n[388] Stanley praises these regulations; Rizal deplores them, as\r\nkeeping the men in authority out of touch with the people.\r\n\r\n[389] Recopilación de leyes, lib. iv, tit. x, ley vii, has the\r\nfollowing law, dated Madrid, March 17, 1608: \"The governor and\r\ncaptain-general of Filipinas shall for the present appoint the\r\nmagistracy [regimiento] of the city of Manila, choosing persons who\r\nshall prove to be suitable for the office and zealous for the service\r\nof God our Lord, and for ours; and he shall not remove them without\r\nour special order.\"\r\n\r\n[390] Many royal decrees related to playing cards. The monopoly\r\nceased to exist perhaps before the government monopoly on betel was\r\ninitiated.--Rizal (in part).\r\n\r\n[391] In 1890 he received 12,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[392] The prebend, in Spanish cathedrals, superior to a canonry.\r\n\r\nThe following laws (xvi and xvii, respectively) as to the appointments\r\nof vacant prebends, are found in Recopilación de leyes, lib. i,\r\ntit. vi.\r\n\r\n\"Because of the great distance from these kingdoms to the Filipinas\r\nIslands and the inconvenience that might result from the prebends\r\nfalling vacant without any provision being made until we present those\r\nwho shall take them, we order the governor and captain-general of the\r\nsaid islands that, when dignidades, canonries, and other prebends in\r\nthe metropolitan church become vacant, he shall present other persons\r\nof the sufficiency and characteristics required, so that they may\r\nserve in place of their predecessors, until we provide persons for\r\nthem. They shall receive the stipend that their predecessors shall have\r\nreceived. The governor shall observe the rules made by the laws of this\r\ntitulo in his presentations.\" Felipe II, Guadalupe, March 26, 1580.\r\n\r\n\"We order our governors of the Filipinas Islands, and charge the\r\narchbishops of Manila, that when any prebends of that church become\r\nvacant, they send us three nominations for each one, instead of one\r\nonly, with very minute advice of their sufficiency, learning, degrees,\r\nand all other qualities that are found in those proposed, so that\r\nafter examination, we may appoint the one most suitable.\" Felipe III,\r\nLerma, June 28, 1608.\r\n\r\n[393] In 1890 the Filipinas were paying 36,670 pesos annually for\r\none dean, four dignitarios, five canons, four racioneros, four\r\nmedio-racioneros, and other inferior helpers, including the choir,\r\na total of twenty-six individuals; 3,330 pesos annually is to be\r\nadded for sacristans, singers, and orchestra.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[394] Their salary amounted to from 750 to 1,000 pesos. Now [1890]\r\nthe salary of each bishop is 6,000 pesos, with two father assistants\r\nat 100 to 150 pesos per month.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[395] Thus in original, but it is carelessly worded; for the Society\r\nof Jesus is not one of the mendicant orders.\r\n\r\n[396] All of the orders held property and had regular means of revenue,\r\nlater; while the Dominicans held enormous property in both the islands\r\nand at Hong Kong.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[397] The following law is from Recopilación de leyes (lib. iii,\r\ntit. x, ley xiv): \"The governor and captain-general of the Filipinas\r\nIslands shall be careful to reward the soldiers who shall have\r\nserved us there, and their sons, with the posts and emoluments at\r\nhis disposal, in accordance with the ordinances, and [he shall do it]\r\nwith all fairness, so that they may have some remuneration. He shall\r\nkeep in toto the laws relating to this.\" Felipe III, Lerma, July 23,\r\n1605; Madrid, December 19, 1618.\r\n\r\n[398] Consejeles: men sent to service by order of a municipal council.\r\n\r\n[399] The pay of various of the above officers and men in 1890 was as\r\nfollows: Filipino infantrymen, 4 pesos per month; Spanish artillerymen,\r\n13-15 pesos, plus some céntimos, per month; Filipino artillerymen,\r\n4 pesos, plus some céntimos, per month; captains, 1,500-1,800 pesos\r\nper year; alféreces, 975-1,050 pesos per year; first sergeants,\r\nEuropean, 318-360 pesos per year--native, 180 pesos per year;\r\nsecond sergeants, European, 248.06-307.50 pesos per year--native,\r\n156 pesos per year; first corporals, European, 189.56-202 pesos per\r\nyear--native, 84 pesos per year; second corporals, European, 174-192\r\npesos per year--native corporals, 72 pesos per year; the segundo cabo\r\n[lieutenant-commander], 12,000 pesos per year; sargento-mayor de\r\nplaza (now lieutenant-colonel), 225 pesos per month; vice-admiral\r\n[contra-almirante, general de galeras], 16,392 pesos per year;\r\nfrigate and ship captains, 2,700-5,760 pesos per year, according to\r\ntheir duties and grades.--Rizal.\r\n\r\nThe following laws from Recopilación de leyes regulate the pay of the\r\nsoldiers and some of the officers, and impose certain restrictions\r\non the soldiers, and provide for certain appointments: \"Each soldier\r\nestablished in the Filipinas Islands shall be paid eight pesos per\r\nmonth, each captain, fifty, each alférez, twenty, and each sergeant,\r\nten. The governor and captain-general of the said islands shall\r\ngive all the men of the companies thirty ducados to each company of\r\nadditional pay, as is done in other districts, providing the additional\r\npay of each one does not exceed ten pesos per year. We order that all\r\nbe well paid. When the governor shall provide any of the captains,\r\nofficers, or soldiers with an encomienda, or other post, he shall\r\nnot allow him to draw pay. While they draw pay they shall not be\r\nallowed to trade or traffic, so that that occupation may not divert\r\nor distract them from their proper exercise and employment of war. For\r\nthe same reason, no pay shall be granted to any soldier who serves any\r\nother person, whomsoever he be.\" Felipe II, Añover, August 9, 1589,\r\nclause 34 of his instructions; Felipe III, Ventosilla, November 4,\r\n1606; lib. iii, tit. x, ley xiii.\r\n\r\n\"We order that when the post of general of artillery of the Filipinas\r\nIslands becomes vacant, either by the death or promotion of its\r\noccupant, or for any other cause, the governor and captain-general\r\nshall not fill it without first notifying us and without our special\r\norder for it. We permit him to appoint a captain of artillery and a\r\nsargento-mayor, and he may assign each of them thirty pesos' pay. We\r\napprove the increase of two pesos in the pay of the musketeers. It\r\nis our will that the pay of the governor's captain of the guard be\r\nincreased five pesos, in addition to his fifteen pesos, and that\r\na like sum be granted to the commandants of forts when they have a\r\ncaptain of infantry.\" Felipe II, clause of letter, Madrid, June 11,\r\n1594; Felipe IV, Madrid, January 30, 1631; lib. iii, tit. v, ley iii.\r\n\r\n[400] A definite law, as is shown in Recopilación de leyes,\r\nlib. iii. tit. iv, ley xiii, charged the viceroys of Nueva España\r\nto send help to the Philippines. The law is as follows: \"We charge\r\nand order the viceroys of Nueva España to aid the governor and\r\ncaptain-general of Filipinas on all occasions that arise, with very\r\nspecial care, promptness, and diligence, with whatever the latter\r\nshall request; and with the men, arms, ammunition, and money, that\r\nhe deems necessary for the conservation of those islands, salaries\r\n[the original is sueldos, perhaps a misprint for suelos, signifying\r\n'provinces' or 'districts'], presidios, and whatever else is under\r\nhis charge.\" Felipe III, Aranjuez, May 25, 1607.\r\n\r\nThe two following laws impose certain restrictions on the\r\nreënforcements sent to the Philippines from Nueva España:\r\n\r\n\"One of the captains who shall raise men in Nueva España as\r\nreënforcements for the Filipinas Islands, shall act as their agent\r\nto the port of Acapulco. There he shall deliver them to the general,\r\nor commander of the ships about to sail; but no captain shall take\r\npassage or go to the islands with the men of his company.\" Felipe III,\r\nZamora, February 16, 1602; lib. iii, tit. iv, ley xvi.\r\n\r\n\"Among the men sent by the viceroy, who shall go as a reënforcement\r\nfrom Nueva España to Filipinas, he shall not allow, under any\r\ncircumstances, or admit, any mestizos or mulattoes, because of\r\nthe annoyances that have been experienced from them.\" Felipe III,\r\nValladolid, August 30, 1608; lib. iii, tit. iv, ley xv.\r\n\r\n[401] See ante, note 227, the citation of the law from Recopilación\r\nde leyes, lib. iii, tit. x, ley xiii.\r\n\r\n[402] See VOL. XII (\"Various documents relating to commerce\"),\r\npp. 57-75.\r\n\r\nBañuelos y Carrillo, in his relation to the king, says: \"That the\r\ninhabitants of the Manilas should be allowed to export as many\r\nboat-loads as possible of the country's produce--such as wax, gold,\r\nperfumes, ivory, and cotton cloth [lampotes]--which they must buy\r\nfrom the natives of the country, who would thus be hindered from\r\nselling them to the Dutch. In this way we would make those peoples\r\nfriendly, and supply Nueva España with their merchandise; and the\r\nmoney taken to Manila would not leave that city. ... Your Majesty\r\nshould consider that one and one-half millions in gold go to China\r\nannually.\" This commerce was advantageous to the Celestial empire\r\nalone and to certain individuals of Manila. It was fatal to España,\r\nand harmful to the islands, whose industry was gradually perishing\r\nlike that of the metropolis.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[403] See in VOL. VIII, pp. 316-318, a royal decree enforcing these\r\nprohibitions under severe penalties.\r\n\r\n[404] Coarse stuff made of goat's hair, or a glossy silk stuff;\r\nprobably the latter is intended in the text. Gorvoran or gorgoran is\r\na sort of silk grogram.\r\n\r\n[405] This fabric is now called Piña. It is made from threads\r\nstripped from fibers of the leaf of that plant or fruit, and which\r\nare never longer than half a yard. It cannot be woven at all times,\r\nas extreme heat or humidity affects the fiber. The machinery employed\r\nis of wood, unmixed with any metal, and of rude construction. This\r\nfabric is stronger than any other of equal fineness, and its color is\r\nunaffected by time or washing. The pieces are generally only 1 1/2 feet\r\nwide: the price varies from 1.s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. per yard. Piña of a\r\nyard wide is from six reals to a dollar (of eight reals) a yard. All\r\nthe joinings of the threads are of knots made by the fingers. It is\r\nfabricated solely by native Indians in many parts of the Philippines,\r\nbut especially in Ilo-Ilo. The use of this stuff is extensive, and\r\nthe value is estimated at 500,000 dollars or £120,000; the value of\r\nthe annual export of it to Europe for dresses, handkerchiefs, collars,\r\nscarfs, and wristbands, which are beautifully embroidered at Manila,\r\nis estimated at 20,000 dollars annually. (Mr. Consul Farren, January\r\n21, 1851).--Stanley.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the fiber of this plant, the fruit is first cut,\r\nso that the leaf may become as long and broad as possible. When\r\nthe leaves are well developed they are torn off, and scraped with a\r\nsharp instrument to separate the fleshy part and leave the fiber;\r\nthis is washed, dried in the sun, combed out, and classed in four\r\ngrades according to its fineness. The cloth has a peculiar softness\r\nand delicacy; and it is said that that made formerly (one or two\r\ncenturies ago) was much finer than that made now.\r\n\r\n[406] Scorzonera is a genus of composite plants, of numerous\r\nspecies; the leaves or roots of many are used as vegetables or\r\nsalads. S. tuberosa and other Eastern species have edible roots.\r\n\r\n[407] Delgado (ut supra) says that this fruit (Diospyros kaki,\r\nLinn.) was brought by the Chinese traders, and called Xi-cu in their\r\nlanguage, whence is derived the word chiquey. It is a beautiful scarlet\r\nfruit, although there is another species of a yellow color. Both are\r\nsweet and pleasant to the taste. Some of the yellow variety were\r\ngrown in the Visayas, but Delgado says the tree is not indigenous\r\nto the islands. The fruit is shaped like an acorn but is about as\r\nlarge as a lemon. The peel is soft and the interior like honey, and\r\nit contains several seeds. The tree is wide-spreading but not very\r\ntall. The leaves are small and almost round. D. kaki is the Chinese\r\nor Japanese persimmon; D. virginiana is the American persimmon. From\r\nother species is obtained the valuable wood called ebony.\r\n\r\n[408] This must be the cloth and not the porcelain of Kaga, which\r\neven today is so highly esteemed.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[409] With very slight differences, this custom and ceremony is\r\ncontinued to the present [1890].--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[410] \"A three per cent duty was imposed in the Filipinas on\r\nmerchandise, for the payment of the troops. We order that part of the\r\nlaw to be observed, but that pertaining to the other things paid from\r\nthose duties to be repealed.\" Añover, August 9, 1589. (Ley xxii.)\r\n\r\n\"We ordain that the Chinese, Japanese, Siamese, Borneans, and all other\r\nforeigners, who go to the ports of the Filipinas Islands, pay no duty\r\non food, supplies, and materials that they take to those islands,\r\nand that this law be kept in the form in w, hich it may have been\r\nintroduced, and not otherwise.\" Añover, August 9, 1589. (Ley xxiv.)\r\n\r\n\"On the Chinese merchandise and that from other countries, shipped to\r\nNueva España by way of Filipinas, an impost ad valorem tax of ten per\r\ncent shall be collected, based on their value in the ports and regions\r\nwhere the goods shall be discharged. This tax shall be imposed mildly\r\naccording to the rule, and shall be a tax additional to that usually\r\npaid on departure both from the said Filipinas Islands and from the\r\nprovinces of Nueva España, to any other places where they may and\r\nshall be taken.\" El Pardo, November 1, 1591.

The\r\nabove laws are from Recopilación de leyes, lib. viii, tit. xv.\r\n\r\n[411] The agave (Agave americana; the maguey of Mexico) is found in\r\nthe Philippines, and is called pita, but Delgado and Blanco think\r\nthat it was not indigenous there. Its fibers were used in former\r\ntimes for making the native textile called nipis, manufactured in the\r\nVisayas. As used in the text, pita means, apparently, some braid or\r\nother ornament of agave fibers.\r\n\r\n[412] The ducado of Castilla was worth slightly more than two\r\npesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[413] These imposts and fetters, which the products of the country\r\ndid not escape, are still [1890] in force, so that foreign markets\r\nmust be sought, since the markets of the mother-country offer no\r\ngreater advantages. According to a document of 1640, this commerce\r\nnetted the government 350,000 pesos annually.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[414] The salary is now [1890] 40,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[415] Recopilación de leyes (lib. iv, tit. i, ley v) outlines the\r\ngovernor's and Audiencia's power in regard to conquests by private\r\nindividuals, as follows: \"We grant permission to the governor and\r\npresident of the Filipinas Islands and its Audiencia to make contracts\r\nfor new explorations and conquests [pacificaciones] with persons,\r\nwho are willing to covenant to do it at their own expense and not at\r\nthat of our royal treasury; and to give them the titles of captains\r\nand masters-of-camp, but not those of adelantados [i.e., governors]\r\nand marshals. Those contracts and agreements such men may execute, with\r\nthe concurrence of the Audiencia, until we approve them, provided that\r\nthey observe the laws enacted for war, conquest, and exploration, so\r\nstraitly, that for any negligence, the terms of their contract will be\r\nobserved, and those who exceed the contract shall incur the penalties\r\nimposed; also provided the parties shall receive our confirmation\r\nwithin a brief period assigned by the governor.\" Felipe II, Guadalupe,\r\nApril 1, 1580; Toledo, May 25, 1596, a clause of instructions.\r\n\r\n[416] There are eight auditors now [1890], and their salary\r\nhas increased to 4,700 pesos, while that of the fiscal is 5,500\r\npesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[417] Recopilación de leyes, lib. v, tit. xv, ley xxviii, contains\r\nthe following on suits arising from residencias, dated Lerma, June\r\n23, 1608: \"Suits brought during the residencia against governors,\r\ncaptains-general, presidents, auditors, and fiscals of our Audiencia\r\nof Manila, and against any other officials, both civil and criminal,\r\nshall pass in appeal and be concluded in that Audiencia, if they do\r\nnot exceed one thousand pesos of the current money.\"\r\n\r\n[418] The tributes of the Indians in the Filipinas amount to more\r\nthan 4,000,000 pesos now [1890]; and from the Chinese are derived\r\n225,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[419] Now since there is no exploitation of gold mines, and since\r\nthe Indians have no jewels that would justify this tenth or fifth,\r\nthe Spaniards substitute for this the imposts upon property, which\r\namount to 105,400 pesos, and that upon industry, which amounts to\r\n1,433,200 pesos. In 1640, the revenue from the above source [fifths or\r\ntenths] had decreased so greatly, that only 750 pesos were collected\r\nannually.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[420] Import duties now [1890] amount to 1,700,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[421] Export duties now [1890] amount to 285,000 pesos.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[422] According to Hernando de los Rios, the Filipinas Islands could\r\nhave been self-sustaining from the beginning from their own products,\r\nhad it not been for the expeditions and adventurous conquests in the\r\nMoluccas, Camboja, etc. ... In the governorship of Don Juan de Silva,\r\nthe treasury owed, for the war in the Moluccas, more than 2,000,000\r\npesos to the Indians, besides what it must have owed to the inhabitants\r\nof Manila.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[423] This excellent custom has entirely perished.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n\"The president of our royal Audiencia of Filipinas and one auditor\r\nof that body, shall, at the beginning of each year, examine the\r\naccounts of our royal officials, and shall finish their examination\r\nwithin the two months of January and February.

In case of the\r\nfinding of any doubts and remarks it is our will that the auditor and\r\ngovernor resolve and determine them, so that they may be concluded and\r\nfinished.

(Ley x.)\r\n\r\nThe above two laws are taken from Recopilación de leyes, lib. viii,\r\ntit. xxix.\r\n\r\n[424] The Chinese engaged in agriculture and fishing now [1890]\r\nare very few.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[425] The Rizal edition misprints fuerça è premio as fuerza á premio.\r\n\r\n[426] The custom of shaving the head, now prevalent among the Chinese,\r\nwas imposed upon them by their Tartar conquerors.\r\n\r\n[427] A kind of stocking called tabi.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[428] The following law was issued at Segovia July 4, 1609, and\r\nappears in Recopilación de leyes, lib. iii, tit. iv, ley xviii:\r\n\"The governor and captain-general of the Filipinas Islands shall\r\never strive to maintain friendly relations, peace, and quiet, with\r\nthe emperor of Japon. He shall avail himself, for that purpose, of\r\nthe most prudent and advisable means, as long as conditions permit;\r\nand he shall not risk the reputation of our arms and state in those\r\nseas and among oriental nations.\"\r\n\r\n[429] This port (established before 1540) was in Colima, Mexico,\r\nnear the present Manzanillo. It was plundered and burned by the\r\nEnglish adventurer Thomas Candish, on August 24-25, 1587.\r\n\r\n[430] Thus named because seamen and voyagers noticed especially\r\nthe lateen sails of the light vessels used by the natives of the\r\nMarianas.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[431] A marine fish (Sparus auratus), thus named because it has spots\r\nof golden-yellow color.\r\n\r\n[432] A chart of the Indian Ocean, by L. S. de la Rochette\r\n(pub. London, 1803, by W. Faden, geographer to the king) shows three\r\nvolcanoes in about 25º north latitude, and but a few degrees north\r\nof the Ladrones. One of them is called \"La Desconocida, or Third\r\nVolcano,\" and the following is added: \"The Manilla ships always try\r\nto make this Volcano.\"\r\n\r\n[433] A group of islands called Shidsi To, lying in 34º 20'.--Rizal.\r\n\r\n[434] \"Thirty-eight degrees\" is probably an error for \"twenty-eight\r\ndegrees,\" and these islands [the first ones mentioned in the above\r\nsentence] would be the Mounin-Sima Islands, lying between 26º 35'\r\nand 27º 45'; and Lot's Wife in 29º 51', and Crespo, in 32º 46', which\r\n[latter] are supposed by the Univers Pittoresque to be the Roca de Oro\r\n[rock of gold] and the Roca de Plata of the ancient maps.--Stanley.\r\n\r\nFor these latter islands, see VOL. XIV, p. 272, note 45.\r\n\r\n[435] A fungous substance that grows in the sea, and contains signs\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n[436] Probably the dogfish, a species of shark.\r\n\r\n[437] Most of these places can be identified on the old maps of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and most of the names\r\nare retained today. The island of Cedros is shown on a map of 1556\r\n(Ramusio: Vniversale della parte del mondo nvovamente ritrovata). The\r\nisland of Cenizas is shown, on the old maps, in about 32º, and Cedros\r\nin about 29º. The Marias or Tres Marias Islands are Maria Madre,\r\nMaria Magdalena, and Maria Cleofas. Cape Corrientes is south of\r\nLa Valle de Banderas and Chametla. Socatul is called Socatula and\r\nZocatula. An English map of 1626, engraved by Abraham Goos, shows\r\nthe town of Ciguatlan, north of Aquapulco, which may be the same as\r\nMorga's Ciguatanejo. Los Motines cannot be identified.\r\n\r\n[438] Acosta in his History of the Indies (Hakluyt Soc. edition,\r\nLondon, 1880) says of the courses between the Philippines and New\r\nSpain: \"The like discourse is of the Navigation made into the South\r\nsea, going from New Spaine or Peru to the Philippines or China, and\r\nreturning from the Philippines or China to New Spaine, the which is\r\neasie, for that they saile alwaies from East to West neere the line,\r\nwhere they finde the Easterly windes to blow in their poope. In the\r\nyeere 1584, there went a shippe from Callao in Lima to the Philippines,\r\nwhich sailed 2000 and 700 leagues without sight of land, and the\r\nfirst it discovered was the Iland of Lusson, where they tooke port,\r\nhaving performed their voiage in two moneths, without want of winde or\r\nany torment, and their course was almost continually vnder the line;\r\n. . . The returne is like vnto the voiage from the Indies vnto Spaine,\r\nfor those which returne from the Philippines or China to Mexico,\r\nto the end they may recover the Westerne windes, they mount a great\r\nheight, vntill they come right against the Ilands of Iappon, and,\r\ndiscovering the Caliphornes, they returne by the coast of New Spaine\r\nto the port of Acapulco.\"",

      "content": "This eBook was produced by David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     \"A LITTLE FIRE BURNS UP A GREAT DEAL OF CORN.\"--OLD PROVERB.\r\n\r\nGuy Darrell resumed the thread of solitary life at Fawley with a calm\r\nwhich was deeper in its gloom than it had been before.  The experiment of\r\nreturn to the social world had failed.  The resolutions which had induced\r\nthe experiment were finally renounced.  Five years nearer to death, and\r\nthe last hope that had flitted across the narrowing passage to the grave,\r\nfallen like a faithless torch from his own hand, and trodden out by his\r\nown foot.\r\n\r\nIt was peculiarly in the nature of Darrell to connect his objects with\r\nposterity--to regard eminence in the Present but as a beacon-height from\r\nwhich to pass on to the Future the name he had taken from the Past.  All\r\nhis early ambition, sacrificing pleasure to toil, had placed its goal at\r\na distance, remote from the huzzas of bystanders; and Ambition halted\r\nnow, baffled and despairing.  Childless, his line would perish with\r\nhimself--himself, who had so vaunted its restoration in the land!  His\r\ngenius was childless also--it would leave behind it no offspring of the\r\nbrain.  By toil he had amassed ample wealth; by talent he had achieved a\r\nsplendid reputation.  But the reputation was as perishable as the wealth.\r\nLet a half-century pass over his tomb, and nothing would be left to speak\r\nof the successful lawyer the applauded orator, save traditional\r\nanecdotes, a laudatory notice in contemporaneous memoirs--perhaps, at\r\nmost, quotations of eloquent sentences lavished on forgotten cases and\r\nobsolete debates--shreds and fragments of a great intellect, which\r\nanother half-century would sink without a bubble into the depths of Time.\r\nHe had enacted no laws--he had administered no state--he had composed no\r\nbooks.  Like the figure on a clock, which adorns the case and has no\r\nconnection with the movement, he, so prominent an or nament to time, had\r\nno part in its works.  Removed, the eye would miss him for a while; but a\r\nnation's literature or history was the same, whether with him or without.\r\nSome with a tithe of his abilities have the luck to fasten their names to\r\nthings that endure; they have been responsible for measures they did not\r\nnot invent, and which, for good or evil, influence long generations.\r\nThey have written volumes out of which a couplet of verse, a period in\r\nprose, may cling to the rock of ages, as a shell that survives a deluge.\r\nBut the orator, whose effects are immediate--who enthralls his audience\r\nin proportion as he nicks the hour--who, were he speaking like Burke\r\nwhat, apart from the subject-matter, closet students would praise, must,\r\nlike Burke, thin his audience, and exchange present oratorical success\r\nfor ultimate intellectual renown--a man, in short, whose oratory is\r\nemphatically that of the DEBATER is, like an actor, rewarded with a loud\r\napplause and a complete oblivion.  Waife on the village stage might win\r\napplause no less loud, followed by oblivion not more complete.\r\n\r\nDarrell was not blind to the brevity of his fame.  In his previous\r\nseclusion he had been resigned to that conviction--now it saddened him.\r\nThen, unconfessed by himself, the idea that he might yet reappear in\r\nactive life, and do something which the world would not willingly let\r\ndie, had softened the face of that tranquil Nature from which he must\r\nsoon now pass out of reach and sight.  On the tree of Time he was a leaf\r\nalready sear upon the bough--not an inscription graven into the rind.\r\n\r\nEver slow to yield to weak regrets--ever seeking to combat his own\r\nenemies within--Darrell said to himself one night, while Fairthorn's\r\nflute was breathing an air of romance through the melancholy walls: \"Is\r\nit too late yet to employ this still busy brain upon works that will live\r\nwhen I am dust, and make Posterity supply the heir that fails to my\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\nHe shut himself up with immortal authors--he meditated on the choice of a\r\ntheme; his knowledge was wide, his taste refined;--words!--he could not\r\nwant words!  Why should he not write?  Alas; why indeed?--He who has\r\nnever been a writer in his youth, can no more be a writer in his age than\r\nhe can be a painter--a musician.  What! not write a book!  Oh, yes--as he\r\nmay paint a picture or set a song.  But a writer, in the emphatic sense\r\nof the word--a writer as Darrell was an orator--oh, no!  And, least of\r\nall, will he be a writer if he has been an orator by impulse and habit--\r\nan orator too happily gifted to require, and too laboriously occupied to\r\nresort to, the tedious aids of written preparation--an orator as modern\r\nlife forms orators--not, of course, an orator like those of the classic\r\nworld, who elaborated sentences before delivery, and who, after delivery,\r\npolished each extemporaneous interlude into rhetorical exactitude and\r\nmusical perfection.  And how narrow the range of compositions to a man\r\nburdened already by a grave reputation!  He cannot have the self-\r\nabandonment--he cannot venture the headlong charge--with which Youth\r\nflings the reins to genius, and dashes into the ranks of Fame.  Few and\r\naustere his themes--fastidious and hesitating his taste.  Restricted are\r\nthe movements of him who walks for the first time into the Forum of\r\nLetters with the purple hem on his senatorial toga.  Guy Darrell, at his\r\nage, entering among authors as a novice!--he, the great lawyer, to whom\r\nattorneys would have sent no briefs had he been suspected of coquetting\r\nwith a muse,--he, the great orator who had electrified audiences in\r\nproportion to the sudden effects which distinguish oral inspiration from\r\nwritten eloquence--he achieve now, in an art which his whole life had\r\nneglected, any success commensurate to his contemporaneous repute;--how\r\nunlikely!  But a success which should outlive that repute, win the\r\n\"everlasting inheritance\" which could alone have nerved him to adequate\r\neffort--how impossible!  He could not himself comprehend why, never at a\r\nloss for language felicitously opposite or richly ornate when it had but\r\nto flow from his thought to his tongue, nor wanting ease, even eloquence,\r\nin epistolary correspondence confidentially familiar--he should find\r\nwords fail ideas, and ideas fail words, the moment his pen became a wand\r\nthat conjured up the Ghost of the dread Public!  The more copious his\r\nthoughts, the more embarrassing their selection; the more exquisite his\r\nperception of excellence in others, the more timidly frigid his efforts\r\nat faultless style.  It would be the same with the most skilful author,\r\nif the Ghost of the Public had not long since ceased to haunt him.  While\r\nhe writes, the true author's solitude is absolute or peopled at his will.\r\nBut take an audience from an orator, what is he?  He commands the living\r\npublic--the Ghost of the Public awes himself.\r\n\r\n\"Surely once,\" sighed Darrell, as he gave his blurred pages to the\r\nflames--\" surely once I had some pittance of the author's talent, and\r\nhave spent it upon lawsuits!\"\r\n\r\nThe author's talent, no doubt, Guy Darrell once had--the author's\r\ntemperament never.  What is the author's temperament?  Too long a task to\r\ndefine.  But without it a man may write a clever book, a useful book, a\r\nbook that may live a year, ten years, fifty years.  He will not stand out\r\nto distant ages a representative of the age that rather lived in him than\r\nhe in it.  The author's temperament is that which makes him an integral,\r\nearnest, original unity, distinct from all before and all that may\r\nsucceed him.  And as a Father of the Church has said that the\r\nconsciousness of individual being is the sign of immortality, not granted\r\nto the inferior creatures--so it is in this individual temperament one\r\nand indivisible, and in the intense conviction of it, more than in all\r\nthe works it may throw off, that the author becomes immortal.  Nay, his\r\nworks may perish like those of Orpheus or Pythagoras; but he himself, in\r\nhis name, in the footprint of his being, remains, like Orpheus or\r\nPythagoras, undestroyed, indestructible.\r\n\r\nResigning literature, the Solitary returned to Science.  There he was\r\nmore at home.  He had cultivated science, in his dazzling academical\r\ncareer, with ardour and success; he had renewed the study, on his first\r\nretirement to Fawley, as a distraction from tormenting memories or\r\nunextin guished passions.  He now for the first time regarded the\r\nabsorbing abstruse occupation as a possible source of fame.  To be one in\r\nthe starry procession of those sons of light who have solved a new law in\r\nthe statute-book of heaven!  Surely a grand ambition, not unbecoming to\r\nhis years and station, and pleasant in its labours to a man who loved\r\nNature's outward scenery with poetic passion, and had studied her inward\r\nmysteries with a sage's minute research.  Science needs not the author's\r\nart--she rejects its gracess--he recoils with a shudder from its fancies.\r\nBut Science requires in the mind of the discoverer a limpid calm.  The\r\nlightnings that reveal Diespiter must flash in serene skies.  No clouds\r\nstore that thunder\r\n\r\n                   \"Quo bruta tellus, et vaga flumina,\r\n                    Quo Styx, et invisi horrida Taenari\r\n                    Sedes, Atlanteusque finis\r\n                    Concutitur!\"\r\n\r\nSo long as you take science only as a distraction, science will not lead\r\nyou to discovery.  And from some cause or other, Guy Darrell was more\r\nunquiet and perturbed in his present than in his past seclusion.  Science\r\nthis time failed even to distract.  In the midst of august meditations--\r\nof close experiment--some haunting angry thought from the far world\r\npassed with rude shadow between Intellect and Truth--the heart eclipsed\r\nthe mind.  The fact is, that Darrell's genius was essentially formed for\r\nAction.  His was the true orator's temperament, with the qualities that\r\nbelong to it--the grasp of affairs--the comprehension of men and states\r\n--the constructive, administrative faculties.  In such career, and in\r\nsuch career alone, could he have developed all his powers, and achieved\r\nan imperishable name.  Gradually as science lost its interest, he\r\nretreated from all his former occupations, and would wander for long\r\nhours over the wild unpopulated landscapes round him.  As if it were his\r\nobject to fatigue the body, and in that fatigue tire out the restless\r\nbrain, he would make his gun the excuse for rambles from sunrise to\r\ntwilight over the manors he had purchased years ago, lying many miles off\r\nfrom Fawley.  There are times when a man who has passed his life in\r\ncultivating his mind finds that the more he can make the physical\r\nexistence predominate, the more he can lower himself to the rude vigour\r\nof the gamekeeper, or his day-labourer--why, the more he can harden his\r\nnerves to support the weight of his reflections.\r\n\r\nIn these rambles he was not always alone.  Fairthorn contrived to\r\ninsinuate himself much more than formerly into his master's habitual\r\ncompanionship.  The faithful fellow had missed Darrell so sorely in that\r\nlong unbroken absence of five years, that on recovering him, Fairthorn\r\nseemed resolved to make up for lost time.  Departing from his own habits,\r\nhe would, therefore, lie in wait for Guy Darrell--creeping out of a\r\nbramble or bush, like a familiar sprite; and was no longer to be awed\r\naway by a curt syllable or a contracted brow.  And Darrell, at first\r\nsubmitting reluctantly, and out of compassionate kindness to the flute-\r\nplayer's obtrusive society, became by degrees to welcome and relax in it.\r\nFairthorn knew the great secrets of his life.  To Fairthorn alone on all\r\nearth could he speak with out reserve of one name and of one sorrow.\r\nSpeaking to Fairthorn was like talking to himself, or to his pointers, or\r\nto his favourite doe, upon which last he bestowed a new collar, with an\r\ninscription that implied more of the true cause that had driven him a\r\nsecond time to the shades of Fawley than he would have let out to Alban\r\nMorley or even to Lionel Haughton.  Alban was too old for that confidence\r\n--Lionel much too young.  But the Musician, like Art itself, was of no\r\nage; and if ever the gloomy master unbent his outward moodiness and\r\nsecret spleen in any approach to gaiety, it was in a sort of saturnine\r\nplayfulness to this grotesque, grown-up infant.  They cheered each other,\r\nand they teased each other.  Stalking side by side over the ridged\r\nfallows, Darrell would sometimes pour forth his whole soul, as a poet\r\ndoes to his muse; and at Fairthorn's abrupt interruption or rejoinder,\r\nturn round on him with fierce objurgation or withering sarcasm, or what\r\nthe flute-player abhorred more than all else, a truculent quotation from\r\nHorace, which drove Fairthorn away into some vanishing covert or hollow,\r\nout of which Darrell had to entice him, sure that, in return, Fairthorn\r\nwould take a sly occasion to send into his side a vindictive prickle.\r\nBut as the two came home in the starlight, the dogs dead beat and poor\r\nFairthorn too,--ten to one but what the musician was leaning all his\r\nweight on his master's nervous arm, and Darrell was looking with tender\r\nkindness in the face of the SOMEONE left to lean upon him still.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they were sitting together in the library, the two\r\nhermits, each in his corner, and after a long silence, the flute-player\r\nsaid abruptly\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thinking!\"  quoth Darrell, with his mechanical irony; \"I am sorry for\r\nyou.  Try not to do so again.\"\r\n\r\nFAIRTHORN.--\"Your poor dear father--\"\r\n\r\nDARRELL (wincing, startled, and expectant of a prickle).--\"Eh?  my\r\nfather--\"\r\n\r\nFAIRTHORN.--\"Was a great antiquary.  How it would have pleased him could\r\nhe have left a fine collection of antiquities as an heirloom to the\r\nnation!--his name thus preserved for ages, and connected with the studies\r\nof his life.  There are the Elgin Marbles.  The parson was talking to me\r\nyesterday of a new Vernon Gallery; why not in the British Museum an\r\neverlasting Darrell room?  Plenty to stock it mouldering yonder in the\r\nchambers which you will never finish.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Dick,\" Said Darrell, starting up, \"give me your hand.  What a\r\nbrilliant thought!  I could do nothing else to preserve my dear father's\r\nname.  Eureka!  You are right.  Set the carpenters at work to-morrow.\r\nRemove the boards; open the chambers; we will inspect their stores, and\r\nselect what would worthily furnish 'A Darrell Room.'  Perish Guy Darrell\r\nthe lawyer!  Philip Darrell the antiquary at least shall live!\"\r\n\r\nIt is marvellous with what charm Fairthorn's lucky idea seized upon\r\nDarrell's mind.  The whole of the next day he spent in the forlorn\r\nskeleton of the unfinished mansion slowly decaying beside his small and\r\nhomely dwelling.  The pictures, many of which were the rarest originals\r\nin early Flemish and Italian art, were dusted with tender care, and hung\r\nfrom hasty nails upon the bare ghastly walls.  Delicate ivory carvings,\r\nwrought by the matchless hand of Cellini-early Florentine bronzes,\r\npriceless specimens of Raffaele ware and Venetian glass--the precious\r\ntrifles, in short, which the collector of mediaeval curiosities amasses\r\nfor his heirs to disperse amongst the palaces of kings and the cabinets\r\nof nations--were dragged again to unfamiliar light.  The invaded\r\nsepulchral building seemed a very Pompeii of the /Cinque Cento/.\r\nTo examine, arrange, methodise, select for national purposes, such\r\nmiscellaneous treasures would be the work of weeks.  For easier access,\r\nDarrell caused a slight hasty passage to be thrown over the gap between\r\nthe two edifices.  It ran from the room nicked into the gables of the old\r\nhouse, which, originally fitted up for scientific studies, now became his\r\nhabitual apartment, into the largest of the uncompleted chambers which\r\nhad been designed for the grand reception-gallery of the new building.\r\nInto the pompous gallery thus made contiguous to his monk-like cell, he\r\ngradually gathered the choicest specimens of his collection.  The damps\r\nwere expelled by fires on grateless hearthstones; sunshine admitted from\r\nwindows now for the first time exchanging boards for glass; rough iron\r\nsconces, made at the nearest forge, were thrust into the walls, and\r\nsometimes lighted at night-Darrell and Fairthorn walking arm-in-arm along\r\nthe unpolished floors, in company with Holbein's Nobles, Perugino's\r\nVirgins.  Some of that highbred company displaced and banished the next\r\nday, as repeated inspection made the taste more rigidly exclusive.\r\nDarrell had found object, amusement, occupation--frivolous if Compared\r\nwith those lenses, and glasses, and algebraical scrawls which had once\r\nwhiled lonely hours in the attic-room hard by; but not frivolous even to\r\nthe judgment of the austerest sage, if that sage had not reasoned away\r\nhis heart.  For here it was not Darrell's taste that was delighted; it\r\nwas Darrell's heart that, ever hungry, had found food.  His heart was\r\nconnecting those long-neglected memorials of an ambition baffled and\r\nrelinquished--here with a nation, there with his father's grave!  How his\r\neyes sparkled! how his lip smiled!  Nobody would have guessed it--none of\r\nus know each other; least of all do we know the interior being of those\r\nwhom we estimate by public repute;--but what a world of simple, fond\r\naffection lay coiled and wasted in that proud man's solitary breast!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     THE LEARNED COMPUTE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLIONS OF\r\n     MILLIONS OF VIBRATIONS HAVE PENETRATED THE EYE BEFORE THE EYE CAN\r\n     DISTINGUISH THE TINTS OF A VIOLET.  WHAT PHILOSOPHY CAN CALCULATE\r\n     THE VIBRATIONS OF THE HEART BEFORE IT CAN DISTINGUISH THE COLOURS OF\r\n     LOVE?\r\n\r\nWhile Guy Darrell thus passed his hours within the unfinished fragments\r\nof a dwelling builded for posterity, and amongst the still relics of\r\nremote generations, Love and Youth were weaving their warm eternal idyll\r\non the sunny lawns by the gliding river.\r\n\r\nThere they are, Love and Youth, Lionel and Sophy, in the arbour round\r\nwhich her slight hands have twined the honeysuckle, fond imitation of\r\nthat bower endeared by the memory of her earliest holiday--she seated\r\ncoyly, he on the ground at her feet, as when Titania had watched his\r\nsleep.  He has been reading to her, the book has fallen from his hand.\r\nWhat book?  That volume of poems so unintelligibly obscure to all but the\r\ndreaming young, who are so unintelligibly obscure to themselves.  But to\r\nthe merit of those poems, I doubt if even George did justice.  It is not\r\ntrue, I believe, that they are not durable.  Some day or other, when all\r\nthe jargon so feelingly denounced by Colonel Morley about \"esthetics,\"\r\nand \"objective,\" and \"subjective,\" has gone to its long home, some critic\r\nwho can write English will probably bring that poor little volume fairly\r\nbefore the public; and, with all its manifold faults, it will take a\r\nplace in the affections, not of one single generation of the young, but\r\n--everlasting, ever-dreaming, ever-growing youth.  But you and I, reader,\r\nhave no other interest in these poems, except this--that they were\r\nwritten by the brother-in-law of that whimsical, miserly Frank Vance, who\r\nperhaps, but for such a brother-in-law, would never have gone through the\r\nlabour by which he has cultivated the genius that achieved his fame; and\r\nif he had not cultivated that genius, he might never have known Lionel;\r\nand if he had never known Lionel, Lionel might never perhaps have gone to\r\nthe Surrey village, in which he saw the Phenomenon: And, to push farther\r\nstill that Voltaireian philosophy of ifs--if either Lionel or Frank Vance\r\nhad not been so intimately associated in the minds of Sophy and Lionel\r\nwith the golden holiday on the beautiful river, Sophy and Lionel might\r\nnot have thought so much of those poems; and if they had not thought so\r\nmuch of those poems, there might not have been between them that link of\r\npoetry without which the love of two young people is a sentiment, always\r\nvery pretty it is true, but much too commonplace to deserve special\r\ncommemoration in a work so uncommonly long as this is likely to be.  And\r\nthus it is clear that Frank Vance is not a superfluous and episodical\r\npersonage amongst the characters of this history, but, however\r\nindirectly, still essentially, one of those beings without whom the\r\nauthor must have given a very different answer to the question, \"What\r\nwill he do with it?\"\r\n\r\nReturn we to Lionel and Sophy.  The poems have brought their hearts\r\nnearer and nearer together.  And when the book fell from Lionel's hand,\r\nSophy knew that his eyes were on her face, and her own eyes looked away.\r\nAnd the silence was so deep and so sweet!  Neither had yet said to the\r\nother a word of love.  And in that silence both felt that they loved and\r\nwere beloved.  Sophy! how childlike she looked still!  How little she is\r\nchanged!--except that the soft blue eyes are far more pensive, and that\r\nher merry laugh is now never heard.  In that luxurious home, fostered\r\nwith the tenderest care by its charming owner, the romance of her\r\nchildhood realised, and Lionel by her side, she misses the old crippled\r\nvagrant.  And therefore it is that her merry laugh is no longer heard!\r\n\"Ah!\" said Lionel, softly breaking the pause at length, \"do not turn your\r\neyes from me, or I shall think that there are tears in them!\"  Sophy's\r\nbreast heaved, but her eyes were averted still.  Lionel rose gently, and\r\ncame to the other side of her quiet form.  \"Fie! there are tears, and you\r\nwould hide them from me.  Ungrateful!\"\r\n\r\nSophy looked at him now with candid, inexpressible, guileless affection\r\nin those swimming eyes, and said with touching sweetness: \"Ungrateful!\r\nShould I not be so if I were gay and happy?\"\r\n\r\nAnd in self-reproach for not being sufficiently unhappy while that young\r\nconsoler was by her side, she too rose, left the arbour, and looked\r\nwistfully along the river.  George Morley was expected; he might bring\r\ntidings of the absent.  And now while Lionel, rejoining her, exerts all\r\nhis eloquence to allay her anxiety and encourage her hopes, and while\r\nthey thus, in that divinest stage of love, ere the tongue repeats what\r\nthe eyes have told, glide along-here in sunlight by lingering flowers-\r\nthere in shadow under mournful willows, whose leaves are ever the latest\r\nto fall, let us explain by what links of circumstance Sophy became the\r\ngreat lady's guest, and Waife once more a homeless wanderer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     COMPRISING MANY NEEDFUL EXPLANATIONS ILLUSTRATIVE OF WISE SAWS; AS\r\n     FOR EXAMPLE, \"HE THAT HATH AN ILL NAME IS HALF HANGED.\"  \"HE THAT\r\n     HATH BEEN BITTEN BY A SERPENT IS AFRAID OF A ROPE.\"  \"HE THAT LOOKS\r\n     FOR A STAR PUTS OUT HIS CANDLES;\" AND, \"WHEN GOD WILLS, ALL WINDS\r\n     BRING RAIN.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader has been already made aware how, by an impulse of womanhood\r\nand humanity, Arabella Crane had been converted from a persecuting into a\r\ntutelary agent in the destinies of Waife and Sophy.  That evolution in\r\nher moral being dated from the evening on which she had sought the\r\ncripple's retreat, to warn him of Jasper's designs.  We have seen by what\r\nstratagem she had made it appear that Waife and his grandchild had sailed\r\nbeyond the reach of molestation; with what liberality she had advanced\r\nthe money that freed Sophy from the manager's claim; and how\r\nconsiderately she had empowered her agent to give the reference which\r\nsecured to Waife the asylum in which we last beheld him.  In a few stern\r\nsentences she had acquainted Waife with her fearless inflexible resolve\r\nto associate her fate henceforth with the life of his lawless son; and,\r\nby rendering abortive all his evil projects of plunder, to compel him at\r\nlast to depend upon her for an existence neither unsafe nor sordid,\r\nprovided only that it were not dishonest.  The moment that she revealed\r\nthat design, Waife's trust in her was won.  His own heart enabled him to\r\ncomprehend the effect produced upon a character otherwise unamiable and\r\nrugged, by the grandeur of self-immolation and the absorption of one\r\ndevoted heroic thought.  In the strength and bitterness of passion which\r\nthus pledged her existence to redeem another's, he obtained the key to\r\nher vehement and jealous nature; saw why she had been so cruel to the\r\nchild of a rival; why she had conceived compassion for that child in\r\nproportion as the father's unnatural indifference had quenched the anger\r\nof her own self-love; and, above all, why, as the idea of reclaiming and\r\nappropriating solely to herself the man who, for good or for evil, had\r\ngrown into the all-predominant object of her life, gained more and more\r\nthe mastery over her mind, it expelled the lesser and the baser passions,\r\nand the old mean revenge against an infant faded away before the light of\r\nthat awakening conscience which is often rekindled from ashes by the\r\nsparks of a single better and worthier thought.  And in the resolute\r\ndesign to reclaim Jasper Losely, Arabella came at once to a ground in\r\ncommon with his father, with his child.  Oh what, too, would the old man\r\nowe to her, what would be his gratitude, his joy, if she not only guarded\r\nhis spotless Sophy, but saved from the bottomless abyss his guilty son!\r\nThus when Arabella Crane had, nearly five years before, sought Waife's\r\ndiscovered hiding-place, near the old bloodstained Tower, mutual\r\ninterests and sympathies had formed between them a bond of alliance not\r\nthe less strong because rather tacitly acknowledged than openly\r\nexpressed.  Arabella had written to Waife from the Continent, for the\r\nfirst half-year pretty often, and somewhat sanguinely, as to the chance\r\nof Losely's ultimate reformation.  Then the intervals of silence became\r\ngradually more prolonged, and the letters more brief.  But still, whether\r\nfrom the wish not unnecessarily to pain the old man, or, as would be more\r\nnatural to her character, which, even in its best aspects, was not\r\ngentle, from a proud dislike to confess failure, she said nothing of the\r\nevil courses which Jasper had renewed.  Evidently she was always near\r\nhim.  Evidently, by some means or another, his life, furtive and dark,\r\nwas ever under the glare of her watchful eyes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sophy had been presented to Caroline Montfort.  As Waife had so\r\nfondly anticipated, the lone childless lady had taken with kindness and\r\ninterest to the fair motherless child.  Left to herself often for months\r\ntogether in the grand forlorn house, Caroline soon found an object to her\r\npensive walks in the basket-maker's cottage.  Sophy's charming face and\r\ncharming ways stole more and more into affections which were denied all\r\nnourishment at home.  She entered into Waife's desire to improve, by\r\neducation, so exquisite a nature; and, familiarity growing by degrees,\r\nSophy was at length coaxed up to the great house; and during the hours\r\nwhich Waife devoted to his rambles (for even in his settled industry he\r\ncould not conquer his vagrant tastes, but would weave his reeds or osiers\r\nas he sauntered through solitudes of turf or wood), became the docile\r\ndelighted pupil in the simple chintz room which Lady Montfort had\r\nreclaimed from the desert of her surrounding palace.  Lady Montfort was\r\nnot of a curious turn of mind; profoundly indifferent even to the gossip\r\nof drawing-rooms, she had no rankling desire to know the secrets of\r\nvillage hearthstones.  Little acquainted even with the great world-\r\nscarcely at all with any world below that in which she had her being,\r\nsave as she approached humble sorrows by delicate charity--the contrast\r\nbetween Waife's calling and his conversation roused in her no vigilant\r\nsuspicions.  A man of some education, and born in a rank that touched\r\nupon the order of gentlemen, but of no practical or professional culture\r\n--with whimsical tastes--with roving eccentric habits--had, in the course\r\nof life, picked up much harmless wisdom, but, perhaps from want of\r\nworldly prudence, failed of fortune.  Contented with an obscure retreat\r\nand a humble livelihood, he might naturally be loth to confide to others\r\nthe painful history of a descent in life.  He might have relations in a\r\nhigher sphere, whom the confession would shame; he might be silent in the\r\nmanly pride which shrinks from alms and pity and a tale of fall.  Nay,\r\ngrant the worst--grant that Waife had suffered in repute as well as\r\nfortune--grant that his character had been tarnished by some plausible\r\ncircumstantial evidences which he could not explain away to the\r\nsatisfaction of friends or the acquittal of a short-sighted world--had\r\nthere not been, were there not always, many innocent men similarly\r\nafflicted?  And who could hear Waife talk, or look on his arch smile, and\r\nnot feel that he was innocent?  So, at least, thought Caroline Montfort.\r\nNaturally; for if, in her essentially woman-like character, there was one\r\nall-pervading and all-predominant attribute, it was PITY.  Lead Fate\r\nplaced her under circumstances fitted to ripen into genial development\r\nall her exquisite forces of soul, her true post in this life would have\r\nbeen that of the SOOTHER.  What a child to some grief-worn father!  What\r\na wife to some toiling, aspiring, sensitive man of genius!  What a mother\r\nto some suffering child!  It seemed as if it were necessary to her to\r\nhave something to compassionate and foster.  She was sad when there was\r\nno one to comfort; but her smile was like a sunbeam from Eden when it\r\nchanced on a sorrow it could brighten away.  Out of this very sympathy\r\ncame her faults--faults of reasoning and judgment.  Prudent in her own\r\nchilling path through what the world calls temptations, because so\r\nineffably pure--because, to Fashion's light tempters, her very thought\r\nwas as closed, as\r\n\r\n               \"Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,\"\r\n\r\nwas the ear of Sabrina to the comrades of Comus,--yet place before her\r\nsome gentle scheme that seemed fraught with a blessing for others, and\r\nstraightway her fancy embraced it, prudence faded--she saw not the\r\nobstacles, weighed not the chances against it.  Charity to her did not\r\ncome alone, but with its sister twins, Hope and Faith.\r\n\r\nThus, benignly for the old man and the fair child, years rolled on till\r\nLord Montfort's sudden death, and his widow was called upon to exchange\r\nMontfort Court (which passed to the new heir) for the distant jointure\r\nHouse of Twickenham.  By this time she had grown so attached to Sophy,\r\nand Sophy so gratefully fond of her, that she proposed to Waife to take\r\nhis sweet grandchild as her permanent companion, complete her education,\r\nand assure her future.  This had been the old man's cherished day-dream;\r\nbut he had not contemplated its realisation until he himself were in the\r\ngrave.  He turned pale, he staggered, when the proposal which would\r\nseparate him from his grandchild was first brought before him.  But he\r\nrecovered ere Lady Montfort could be aware of the acuteness of the pang\r\nshe inflicted, and accepted the generous offer with warm protestations of\r\njoy and gratitude.  But Sophy! Sophy consent to leave her grandfather\r\nafar and aged in his solitary cottage!  Little did either of them know\r\nSophy, with her soft heart and determined soul, if they supposed such\r\negotism possible in her.  Waife insisted--Waife was angry--Waife was\r\nauthoritative--Waife was imploring--Waife was pathetic--all in vain!  But\r\nto close every argument, the girl went boldly to Lady Montfort, and said:\r\n\"If I left him, his heart would break--never ask it.\"  Lady Montfort\r\nkissed Sophy tenderly as mother ever kissed a child for some sweet loving\r\ntrait of a noble nature, and said simply \"But he shall not be left--he\r\nshall come too.\"\r\n\r\nShe offered Waife rooms in her Twickenham house--she wished to collect\r\nbooks--he should be librarian.  The old man shivered and refused--refused\r\nfirmly.  He had made a vow not to be a guest in any house.  Finally, the\r\nmatter was compromised; Waife would remove to the neighbourhood of\r\nTwickenham; there hire a cottage; there ply his art; and Sophy, living\r\nwith him, should spend part of each day with Lady Montfort as now.\r\n\r\nSo it was resolved.  Waife consented to occupy a small house on the verge\r\nof the grounds belonging to the jointure villa, on the condition of\r\npaying rent for it.  And George Morley insisted on the privilege of\r\npreparing that house for his old teacher's reception, leaving it simple\r\nand rustic to outward appearance, but fitting its pleasant chambers with\r\nall that his knowledge of the old man's tastes and habits suggested for\r\ncomfort or humble luxury; a room for Sophy, hung with the prettiest\r\npaper, all butterflies and flowers, commanding a view of the river.\r\nWaife, despite his proud scruples, could not refuse such gifts from a man\r\nwhose fortune and career had been secured by his artful lessons.  Indeed,\r\nhe had already permitted George to assist, though not largely, his own\r\nefforts to repay the L100 advanced by Mrs. Crane.  The years he had\r\ndevoted to a craft which his ingenuity made lucrative, had just enabled\r\nthe basketmaker, with his pupil's aid, to clear off that debt by\r\ninstalments.  He had the satisfaction of thinking that it was his\r\nindustry that had replaced the sum to which his grandchild owed her\r\nrelease from the execrable Rugge.\r\n\r\nLady Montfort's departure (which preceded Waife's by some weeks) was more\r\nmourned by the poor in her immediate neighbourhood than by the wealthier\r\nfamilies who composed what a province calls its society; and the gloom\r\nwhich that event cast over the little village round the kingly mansion\r\nwas increased when Waife and his grandchild left.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, emboldened by Lady Montfort's protection, and\r\nthe conviction that he was no longer pursued or spied, the old man\r\nrelaxed his earlier reserved and secluded habits.  Constitutionally\r\nsociable, he had made acquaintance with his humbler neighbours; lounged\r\nby their cottage palings in his rambles down the lanes; diverted their\r\nchildren with Sir Isaac's tricks, or regaled them with nuts and apples\r\nfrom his little orchard; giving to the more diligent labourers many a\r\nvaluable hint how to eke out the daily wage with garden produce, or bees,\r\nor poultry; doctored farmer's cows; and even won the heart of the stud-\r\ngroom by a mysterious sedative ball, which had reduced to serene docility\r\na highly nervous and hitherto unmanageable four-year-old.  Sophy had been\r\nno less popular.  No one grudged her the favour of Lady Montfort--no one\r\nwondered at it.  They were loved and honoured.  Perhaps the happiest\r\nyears Waife had known since his young wife left the earth were passed in\r\nthe hamlet which he fancied her shade haunted; for was it not there--\r\nthere, in that cottage--there, in sight of those green osiers, that her\r\nfirst modest virgin replies to his letters of love and hope that soothed\r\nhis confinement and animated him--till then little fond of sedentary\r\ntoils--to the very industry which, learned in sport, now gave\r\nsubsistence, and secured a home.  To that home persecution had not\r\ncome--gossip had not pryed into its calm seclusion--even chance, when\r\nthreatening disclosure, had seemed to pass by innocuous.  For once\r\n--a year or so before he left--an incident had occurred which alarmed him\r\nat the time, but led to no annoying results.  The banks of the great\r\nsheet of water in Montfort Park were occasionally made the scene of rural\r\npicnics by the families of neighbouring farmers or tradesmen.  One day\r\nWaife, while carelessly fashioning his baskets on his favourite spot, was\r\nrecognised, on the opposite margin, by a party of such holiday-makers to\r\nwhom he himself had paid no attention.  He was told the next day by the\r\nlandlady of the village inn, the main chimney of which he had undertaken\r\nto cure of smoking, that a \"lady\" in the picnic symposium of the day\r\nbefore had asked many questions about him and his grandchild, and had\r\nseemed pleased to hear they were both so comfortably settled.  The\r\n\"lady\" had been accompanied by another \"lady,\" and by two or three young\r\ngentlemen.  They had arrived in a \"buss,\" which they had hired for the\r\noccasion.  They had come from Humberston the day after those famous races\r\nwhich annually filled Humberston with strangers--the time of year in\r\nwhich Rugge's grand theatrical exhibition delighted that ancient town.\r\nFrom the description of the two ladies Waife suspected that they belonged\r\nto Rugge's company.\r\n\r\nBut they had not claimed Waife as a ci-devant comrade; they had not\r\nspoken of Sophy as the Phenomenon or the Fugitive.  No molestation\r\nfollowed this event; and, after all, the Remorseless Baron had no longer\r\nany claim to the Persecuted Bandit or to Juliet Araminta.\r\n\r\nBut the ex-comedian is gone from the osiers--the hamlet.  He is in his\r\nnew retreat by the lordly river--within an hour of the smoke and roar of\r\ntumultuous London.  He tries to look cheerful and happy, but his repose\r\nis troubled--his heart is anxious.  Ever since Sophy, on his account,\r\nrefused the offer which would have transferred her, not for a few daily\r\nhours, but for habitual life, from a basketmaker's roof to all the\r\nelegancies and refinements of a sphere in which, if freed from him, her\r\ncharms and virtues might win her some such alliance as seemed impossible,\r\nwhile he was thus dragging her down to his own level,--ever since that\r\nday the old man had said to himself, \"I live too long.\"  While Sophy was\r\nby his side he appeared busy at his work and merry in his humour; the\r\nmoment she left him for Lady Montfort's house, the work dropped from his\r\nhands, and he sank into moody thought.\r\n\r\nWaife had written to Mrs. Crane (her address then was at Paris) on\r\nremoving to Twickenhain, and begged her to warn him should Jasper\r\nmeditate a return to England, by a letter directed to him at the General\r\nPost-office, London.  Despite his later trust in Mrs. Crane, he did not\r\ndeem it safe to confide to her Lady Montfort's offer to Sophy, or the\r\naffectionate nature of that lady's  intimacy with the girl now grown into\r\nwomanhood.  With that insight into the human heart, which was in him not\r\nso habitually clear and steadfast as to be always useful, but at times\r\nsingularly if erratically lucid, he could not feel assured that Arabella\r\nCrane's ancient hate to Sophy (which, lessening in proportion to the\r\ngirl's destitution, had only ceased when the stern woman felt, with a\r\nsentiment bordering on revenge, that it was to her that Sophy owed an\r\nasylum obscure and humble) might not revive, if she learned that the\r\nchild of a detested rival was raised above the necessity of her\r\nprotection, and brought within view of that station so much Loftier than\r\nher own, from which she had once rejoiced to know that the offspring of a\r\nmarriage which had darkened her life was excluded.  For indeed it had\r\nbeen only on Waife's promise that he would not repeat the attempt that\r\nhad proved so abortive, to enforce Sophy's claim on Guy Darrell, that\r\nArabella Crane had in the first instance resigned the child to his care.\r\nHis care--his--an attainted outcast!  As long as Arabella Crane could see\r\nin Sophy but an object of compassion, she might haughtily protect her;\r\nbut, could Sophy become an object of envy, would that protection last?\r\nNo, he did not venture to confide in Mrs. Crane further than to say that\r\nhe and Sophy had removed from Montfort village to the vicinity of London.\r\nTime enough to say more when Mrs. Crane returned to England; and then,\r\nnot by letter, but in personal interview.\r\n\r\nOnce a month the old man went to London to inquire at the General Post-\r\noffice for any communications his correspondent might there address to\r\nhim.  Only once, however, had he heard from Mrs. Crane since the\r\nannouncement of his migration, and her note of reply was extremely brief,\r\nuntil in the fatal month of June, when Guy Darrell and Jasper Losely had\r\nalike returned, and on the same day, to the metropolis; and then the old\r\nman received from her a letter which occasioned him profound alarm.  It\r\napprised him not only that his terrible son was in England--in London;\r\nbut that Jasper had discovered that the persons embarked for America were\r\nnot the veritable Waife and Sophy whose names they had assumed.  Mrs.\r\nCrane ended with these ominous words: \"It is right to say now that he has\r\ndescended deeper and deeper.  Could you see him, you would wonder that I\r\nneither abandon him nor my resolve.  He hates me worse than the gibbet.\r\nTo me and not to the gibbet he shall pass--fitting punishment to both.\r\nI am in London, not in my old house, but near him.  His confidant is my\r\nhireling.  His life and his projects are clear to my eyes--clear as if he\r\ndwelt in glass.  Sophy is now of an age in which, were she placed in the\r\ncare of some person whose respectability could not be impunged, she could\r\nnot be legally forced away against her will; but if under your roof,\r\nthose whom Jasper has induced to institute a search, that he has no means\r\nto institute very actively himself, might make statements which (as you\r\nare already aware) might persuade others, though well-meaning, to assist\r\nhim in separating her from you.  He might publicly face even a police-\r\ncourt, if he thus hoped to shame the rich man into buying off an\r\nintolerable scandal.  He might, in the first instance, and more probably,\r\ndecoy her into his power through stealth; and what might become of her\r\nbefore she was recovered?  Separate yourself from her for a time.  It is\r\nyou, notwithstanding your arts of disguise, that can be the more easily\r\ntracked.  She, now almost a woman, will have grown out of recognition.\r\nPlace her in some secure asylum until, at least, you hear from me again.\"\r\n\r\nWaife read and re-read this epistle (to which there was no direction that\r\nenabled him to reply) in the private room of a little coffee-house to\r\nwhich he had retired from the gaze and pressure of the street.  The\r\ndetermination he had long brooded over now began to take shape--to be\r\nhurried on to prompt decision.  On recovering his first shock, he formed\r\nand matured his plans.  That same evening he saw Lady Montfort.  He felt\r\nthat the time had come when, for Sophy's sake, he must lift the veil from\r\nthe obloquy on his own name.  To guard against the same concession to\r\nJasper's authority that had betrayed her at Gatesboro', it was necessary\r\nthat he should explain the mystery of Sophy's parentage and position to\r\nLady Montfort, and go through the anguish of denouncing his own son as\r\nthe last person to whose hands she should be consigned.  He approached\r\nthis subject not only with a sense of profound humiliation, but with no\r\nunreasonable fear lest Lady Montfort might at once decline a charge which\r\nwould possibly subject her retirement to a harassing invasion.  But, to\r\nhis surprise as well as relief, no sooner had he named Sophy's parentage\r\nthan Lady Montfort evinced emotions of a joy which cast into the shade\r\nall more painful or discreditable associations.  \"Henceforth, believe\r\nme,\" she said, \"your Sophy shall be my own child, my own treasured\r\ndarling!--no humble companion--my equal as well as my charge.  Fear not\r\nthat any one shall tear her from me.  You are right in thinking that my\r\nroof should be her home--that she should have the rearing and the station\r\nwhich she is entitled as well as fitted to adorn.  But you must not part\r\nfrom her.  I have listened to your tale; my experience of you supplies\r\nthe defence you suppress--it reverses the judgment which has aspersed\r\nyou.  And more ardently than before, I press on you a refuge in the Home\r\nthat will shelter your grandchild.\"  Noble-hearted woman!  and nobler for\r\nher ignorance of the practical world, in the proposal which would have\r\nblistered with scorching blushes the cheek of that Personification of all\r\n\"Solemn Plausibilities,\" the House of Vipont!  Gentleman Waife was not\r\nscamp enough to profit by the ignorance which sprang from generous\r\nvirtue.  But, repressing all argument, and appearing to acquiesce in the\r\npossibility of such an arrangement, he left her benevolent delight\r\nunsaddened--and before the morning he was gone.  Gone in stealth, and by\r\nthe starlight, as he had gone years ago from the bailiff's cottage-gone,\r\nfor Sophy, in waking, to find, as she had found before, farewell lines,\r\nthat commended hope and forbade grief.  \"It was,\" he wrote, \"for both\r\ntheir sakes that he had set out on a tour of pleasant adventure.  He\r\nneeded it; he had felt his spirits droop of late in so humdrum and\r\nsettled a life.  And there was danger abroad--danger that his brief\r\nabsence would remove.  He had confided all his secrets to Lady Montfort;\r\nshe must look on that kind lady as her sole guardian till he return--as\r\nreturn he surely would; and then they would live happy ever afterwards as\r\nin fairy tales.  He should never forgive her if she were silly enough to\r\nfret for him.  He should not be alone; Sir Isaac would take care of him.\r\nHe was not without plenty of money-savings of several months; if he\r\nwanted more, he would apply to George Morley.  He would write to her\r\noccasionally; but she must not expect frequent letters; he might be away\r\nfor months--what did that signify?  He was old enough to take care of\r\nhimself; she was no longer a child to cry her eyes out if she lost a\r\nsenseless toy, or a stupid old cripple.  She was a young lady, and he\r\nexpected to find her a famous scholar when he returned.\"  And so, with\r\nall flourish and bravado, and suppressing every attempt at pathos, the\r\nold man went his way, and Sophy, hurrying to Lady Montfort's, weeping,\r\ndistracted, imploring her to send in all directions to discover and bring\r\nback the fugitive, was there detained a captive guest.  But Waife left a\r\nletter also for Lady Montfort, cautioning and adjuring her, as she valued\r\nSophy's safety from the scandal of Jasper's claim, not to make any\r\nimprudent attempts to discover him.  Such attempt would only create the\r\nvery publicity from the chance of which he was seeking to escape.  The\r\nnecessity of this caution was so obvious that Lady Montfort could only\r\nsend her most confidential servant to inquire guardedly in the\r\nneighbourhood, until she had summoned George Morley from Humberston,\r\nand taken him into counsel.  Waife had permitted her to relate to him,\r\non strict promise of secrecy, the tale he had confided to her.  George\r\nentered with the deepest sympathy into Sophy's distress; but he made her\r\ncomprehend the indiscretion and peril of any noisy researches.  He\r\npromised that he himself would spare no pains to ascertain the old man's\r\nhiding-place, and see, at least, if he could not be persuaded either to\r\nreturn or suffer her to join him, that he was not left destitute and\r\ncomfortless.  Nor was this an idle promise.  George, though his inquiries\r\nwere unceasing, crippled by the restraint imposed on them, was so acute\r\nin divining, and so active in following up each clue to the wanderer's\r\nartful doublings, that more than once he had actually come upon the\r\ntrack, and found the very spot where Waife or Sir Isaac had been seen a\r\nfew days before.  Still, up to the day on which Morley had last reported\r\nprogress, the ingenious ex-actor, fertile in all resources of stratagem\r\nand disguise, had baffled his research.  At first, however, Waife had\r\ngreatly relieved the minds of these anxious friends, and cheered even\r\nSophy's heavy heart, by letters, gay though brief.  These letters having,\r\nby their postmarks, led to his trace, he had stated, in apparent anger,\r\nthat reason for discontinuing them.  And for the last six weeks no line\r\nfrom him had been received.  In fact, the old man, on resolving to\r\nconsummate his self-abnegation, strove more and more to wean his\r\ngrandchild's thoughts from his image.  He deemed it so essential to her\r\nwhole future that, now she had found a home in so secure and so elevated\r\na sphere, she should gradually accustom herself to a new rank of life,\r\nfrom which he was an everlasting exile; should lose all trace of his very\r\nbeing; efface a connection that, ceasing to protect, could henceforth\r\nonly harm and dishonour her,--that he tried, as it were, to blot himself\r\nout of the world which now smiled on her.  He did not underrate her grief\r\nin its first freshness; he knew that, could she learn where he was, all\r\nelse would be forgotten--she would insist on flying to him.  But he\r\ncontinually murmured to himself: \"Youth is ever proverbially short of\r\nmemory; its sorrows poignant, but not enduring; now the wounds are\r\nalready scarring over--they will not reopen if they are left to heal.\"\r\n\r\nHe had, at first, thought of hiding somewhere not so far but that once\r\na-week, or once a-month, he might have stolen into the grounds, looked at\r\nthe house that held her--left, perhaps, in her walks some little token of\r\nhimself.  But, on reflection, he felt that that luxury would be too\r\nimprudent, and it ceased to tempt him in proportion as he reasoned\r\nhimself into the stern wisdom of avoiding all that could revive her grief\r\nfor him.  At the commencement of this tale, in the outline given of that\r\ngrand melodrama in which Juliet Araminta played the part of the Bandit's\r\nChild, her efforts to decoy pursuit from the lair of the persecuted Mime\r\nwere likened to the arts of the skylark to lure eye and hand from the\r\nnest of his young.  More appropriate that illustration now to the parent-\r\nbird than then to the fledgling.  Farther and farther from the nest in\r\nwhich all his love was centred fled the old man.  What if Jasper did\r\ndiscover him now; that very discovery would mislead the pursuit from\r\nSophy.  Most improbable that Losely would ever guess that they could\r\nbecome separated; still more improbable, unless Waife, imprudently\r\nlurking near her home, guided conjecture, that Losely should dream of\r\nseeking under the roof of the lofty peeress the child that had fled from\r\nMr. Rugge.\r\n\r\nPoor old man! his heart was breaking; but his soul was so brightly\r\ncomforted that there, where many, many long miles off, I see him\r\nstanding, desolate and patient, in the corner of yon crowded market-\r\nplace, holding Sir Isaac by slackened string with listless hand--Sir\r\nIsaac unshorn, travel-stained, draggled, with drooping head and\r\nmelancholy eyes--yea, as I see him there, jostled by the crowd, to whom,\r\nnow and then, pointing to that huge pannier on his arm, filled with some\r\nhomely pedlar wares, he mechanically mutters, \"Buy\"--yea, I say, verily,\r\nas I see him thus, I cannot draw near in pity--I see what the crowd does\r\nnot--the shadow of an angel's wing over his grey head; and I stand\r\nreverentially aloof, with bated breath and bended knee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN TOO OFTEN REASONS FROM HER HEART--HENCE TWO-THIRDS OF HER\r\n     MISTAKES AND HER TROUBLES.  A MAN OF GENIUS, TOO, OFTEN REASONS FROM\r\n     HIS HEART-WENCE, ALSO, TWO-THIRDS OF HIS TROUBLES AND MISTAKES.\r\n     WHEREFORE, BETWEEN WOMAN AND GENIUS THERE IS A SYMPATHETIC AFFINITY;\r\n     EACH HAS SOME INTUITIVE COMPREHENSION OF THE SECRETS OF THE OTHER,\r\n     AND THE MORE FEMININE THE WOMAN, THE MORE EXQUISITE THE GENIUS, THE\r\n     MORE SUBTLE THE INTELLIGENCE BETWEEN THE TWO.  BUT NOTE WELL THAT\r\n     THIS TACIT UNDERSTANDING BECOMES OBSCURED, IF HUMAN LOVE PASS ACROSS\r\n     ITS RELATIONS.  SHAKESPEARE INTERPRETS ARIGHT THE MOST INTRICATE\r\n     RIDDLES IN WOMAN.  A WOMAN WAS THE FIRST TO INTERPRET ARIGHT THE ART\r\n     THAT IS LATENT IN SHAKESPEARE.  BUT DID ANNE HATHAWAY AND\r\n     SHAKESPEARE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?\r\n\r\nUnobserved by the two young people, Lady Montfort sate watching them as\r\nthey moved along the river banks.  She was seated where Lionel had first\r\nseen her--in the kind of grassy chamber that had been won from the\r\nfoliage and the sward, closed round with interlaced autumnal branches,\r\nsave where it opened towards the water.  If ever woman's brain can\r\nconceive and plot a scheme thoroughly pure from one ungentle, selfish\r\nthread in its web, in such a scheme had Caroline Montfort brought\r\ntogether those two fair young natures.  And yet they were not uppermost\r\nin her thoughts as she now gazed on them; nor was it wholly for them that\r\nher eyes were filled with tears at once sweet, yet profoundly mournful--\r\nholy, and yet intensely human.\r\n\r\nWomen love to think themselves uncomprehended--nor often without reason\r\nin that foible; for man, howsoever sagacious, rarely does entirely\r\ncomprehend woman, howsoever simple.  And in this her sex has the\r\nadvantage over ours.  Our hearts are bare to their eyes, even though they\r\ncan never know what have been our lives.  But we may see every action of\r\ntheir lives, guarded and circumscribed in conventional forms, while their\r\nhearts will have many mysteries to which we can never have the key.  But,\r\nin more than the ordinary sense of the word, Caroline Montfort never had\r\nbeen a woman uncomprehended.  Nor even in her own sex did she possess one\r\nconfidante.  Only the outward leaves of that beautiful flower opened to\r\nthe sunlight.  The leaves round the core were gathered fold upon fold\r\nclosely as when life itself was in the bud.\r\n\r\nAs all the years of her wedded existence her heart had been denied the\r\nnatural household vents, so by some strange and unaccountable chance her\r\nintellect also seemed restrained and pent from its proper freedom and\r\nplay.  During those barren years, she had read--she had pondered--she had\r\nenjoyed a commune with those whose minds instruct others, and still her\r\nown intelligence, which in early youth had been characterised by singular\r\nvivacity and brightness, and which Time had enriched with every womanly\r\naccomplishment, seemed chilled and objectless.  It is not enough that a\r\nmind should be cultured--it should have movement as well as culture.\r\nCaroline Montfort's lay quiescent like a beautiful form spellbound to\r\nrepose, but not to sleep.  Looking on her once, as he stood amongst a\r\ncrowd whom her beauty dazzled, a poet said abruptly: \"Were my guess not a\r\nsacrilege to one so spotless and so haughty, I should say that I had hit\r\non the solution of an enigma that long perplexed me; and in the core of\r\nthat queen of the lilies, could we strip the leaves folded round it, we\r\nshould find Remorse.\"\r\n\r\nLady Montfort started; the shadow of another form than her own fell upon\r\nthe sward.  George Morley stood behind her, his finger on his lips.\"\r\nHush,\" he said in a whisper, see, Sophy is looking for me up the river.\r\nI knew she would be--I stole this way on purpose--for I would speak to\r\nyou before I face her questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter? you alarm me,\" said Lady Montfort, on gaining a part\r\nof the grounds more remote from the river, to which George had silently\r\nled the way.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear cousin, there is less cause for alarm than for anxious\r\ndeliberation, and that upon more matters than those which directly relate\r\nto our poor fugitive.  You know that I long shrunk from enlisting the\r\npolice in aid of our search.  I was too sensible of the pain and offence\r\nwhich such an application would occasion Waife--(let us continue so to\r\ncall him)--and the discovery of it might even induce him to put himself\r\nbeyond our reach, and quit England.  But his prolonged silence, and my\r\nfears lest some illness or mishap might have befallen him, together with\r\nmy serious apprehensions of the effect which unrelieved anxiety might\r\nproduce on Sophy's health, made me resolve to waive former scruples.\r\nSince I last saw you I have applied to one of the higher police-officers\r\naccustomed to confidential investigations of a similar nature.  The next\r\nday he came to tell me that he had learned that a friend of his, who had\r\nbeen formerly a distinguished agent in the detective police, had been\r\nengaged for months in tracking a person whom he conjectured to be the\r\nsame as the one whom I had commissioned him to discover, and with\r\nsomewhat less caution and delicacy than I had enjoined.  The fugitive's\r\nreal name had been given to this ex-agent--the cause for search, that he\r\nhad abducted and was concealing his granddaughter from her father.  It\r\nwas easy for me to perceive why this novel search had hitherto failed, no\r\nsuspicion being entertained that Waife had separated himself from Sophy,\r\nand the inquiry being therefore rather directed towards the grandchild\r\nthan the grandfather.  But that inquiry had altogether ceased of late,\r\nand for this terrible reason--a different section of the police had fixed\r\nits eye upon the father on whose behalf the search had been instituted.\r\nThis Jasper Losely (ah! our poor friend might well shudder to think Sophy\r\nshould fall into his hands!) haunts the resorts of the most lawless and\r\nformidable desperadoes of London.  He appears to be a kind of authority\r\namongst them; but there is no evidence that as yet he has committed\r\nhimself to any participation in their habitual courses.  He lives\r\nprofusely, for a person in such society (regaling Daredevils whom he awes\r\nby a strength and courage which are described as extraordinary), but with\r\nout any visible means.  It seems that the ex-agent, who had been thus\r\npreviously employed in Jasper Losely's name, had been engaged, not by\r\nJasper himself, but by a person in very respectable circumstances, whose\r\nname I have ascertained to be Poole.  And the ex-agent deemed it right to\r\nacquaint this Mr. Poole with Jasper's evil character and ambiguous mode\r\nof life, and to intimate to his employer that it might not be prudent to\r\nhold any connection with such a man, and still less proper to assist in\r\nrestoring a young girl to his care.  On this Mr. Poole became so much\r\nagitated, and expressed himself so incoherently as to his relations with\r\nJasper, that the ex-agent conceived suspicions against Poole himself, and\r\nreported the whole circumstances to one of the chiefs of the former\r\nservice, through whom they reached the very man whom I myself was\r\nemploying.  But this ex-agent, who had, after his last interview with\r\nPoole, declined all further interference, had since then, through a\r\ncorrespondent in a country town, whom he had employed at the first,\r\nobtained a clue to my dear old friend's wanderings, more recent, and I\r\nthink more hopeful, than any I had yet discovered.  You will remember\r\nthat when questioning Sophy as to any friends in her former life to whom\r\nit was probable Waife might have addressed himself, she could think of no\r\none so probable as a cobbler named Merle, with whom he and she had once\r\nlodged, and of whom he had often spoken to her with much gratitude as\r\nhaving put him in the way of recovering herself, and having shown him a\r\npeculiar trustful kindness on tha+ occasion.  But you will remember also\r\nthat I could not find this Merle; he had left the village, near this very\r\nplace, in which he had spent the greater part of his lifehis humble trade\r\nhaving been neglected in consequence of some strange superstitious\r\noccupations in which, as he had gown older, he had become more and more\r\nabsorbed.  He had fallen into poverty, his effects had been sold off; he\r\nhad gone away no one knew whither.  Well, the ex-agent, who had also been\r\ndirected to this Merle by his employer, had, through his correspondent,\r\nascertained that the cobbler was living at Norwich, where he passed under\r\nthe name of the Wise Man, and where he was in perpetual danger of being\r\nsent to the house of correction as an impostor, dealing in astrology,\r\ncrystal-seeing, and such silly or nefarious practices.  Very odd, indeed,\r\nand very melancholy, too,\" quoth the scholar, lifting up his hands and\r\neyes, \"that a man so gifted as our poor friend should ever have\r\ncultivated an acquaintance with a cobbler who deals in the Black Art!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sophy has talked to me much about that cobbler,\" said Lady Montfort,\r\nwith her sweet half-smile.  \"It was under his roof that she first saw\r\nLionel Haughton.  But though the poor man may be an ignorant enthusiast,\r\nhe is certainly, by her account, too kind and simple-hearted to be a\r\ndesigning impostor.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE.--\"Possibly.  But to go on with my story: A few weeks ago, an\r\nelderly lame man, accompanied by a dog, who was evidently poor dear Sir\r\nIsaac, lodged two days with Merle at Norwich.  On hearing this, I myself\r\nwent yesterday to Norwich, saw and talked to Merle, and through this man\r\nI hope, more easily, delicately, and expeditiously than by any other\r\nmeans, to achieve our object.  He evidently can assist us, and, as\r\nevidently, Waife has not told him that he is flying from Sophy and\r\nfriends, but from enemies and persecutors.  For Merle, who is impervious\r\nto bribes, and who at first was churlish and rude, became softened as my\r\nhonest affection for the fugitive grew clear to him, and still more when\r\nI told him how wretched Sophy was at her grandfather's disappearance, and\r\nthat she might fret herself into a decline.  And we parted with this\r\npromise on his side, that if I would bring \"down to him either Sophy\r\nherself (which is out of the question) or a line from her, which, in\r\nreferring to any circumstances while under his roof that could only be\r\nknown to her and himself, should convince him that the letter was from\r\nher hand, assuring him that it was for Waife's benefit and at her prayer\r\nthat he should bestir himself in search for her grandfather, and that he\r\nmight implicitly trust to me, he would do all he could to help us.  So\r\nfar, then, so good.  But I have now more to say, and that is in reference\r\nto Sophy herself.  While we are tracking her grandfather, the peril to\r\nher is not lessened.  Never was that peril thoroughly brought before my\r\neyes until I had heard actually from the police agent the dreadful\r\ncharacter and associations of the man who can claim her in a fathers\r\nname.  Waife, it is true, had told you that his son was profligate,\r\nspendthrift, lawless--sought her, not from natural affection, but as an\r\ninstrument to be used, roughly and coarsely, for the purpose of extorting\r\nmoney from Mr. Darrell.  But this stops far short of the terrible\r\nreality.  Imagine the effect on her nerves, so depressed as they now are,\r\nnay, on her very life, should this audacious miscreant force himself here\r\nand say, 'Come with me, you are my child.'  And are we quite sure that\r\nout of some refining ncbleness of conscience she might not imagine it her\r\nduty to obey, and to follow him?  The more abject and friendless his\r\ncondition, the more she might deem it her duty to be by his side.  I have\r\nstudied her from her childhood.  She is capable of any error in judgment,\r\nif it be made to appear a martyr's devoted self-sacrifice.  You may well\r\nshudder, my dear cousin.  But grant that she were swayed by us and by the\r\nargument that so to act would betray and kill her beloved grandfather,\r\nstill, in resisting this ruffian's paternal authority, what violent and\r\npainful scenes might ensue!  What dreadful publicity to be attached for\r\never to her name!  Nor is this all.  Grant that her father does not\r\ndiscover her, but that he is led by his associates into some criminal\r\noffence, and suffers by the law--her relationship, both to him from whom\r\nyou would guard her, and to him whose hearth you have so tenderly reared\r\nher to grace, suddenly dragged to day--would not the shame kill her?  And\r\nin that disclosure how keen would be the anguish of Darrell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, heavens!\"  cried Caroline Montfort, white as ashes and wringing her\r\nhands, \"you freeze me with terror.  But this man cannot be so fallen as\r\nyou describe.  I have seen him--spoken with him in his youth--hoped then\r\nto assist in a task of conciliation, pardon.  Nothing about him then\r\nforeboded so fearful a corruption.  He might be vain, extravagant,\r\nselfish, false--Ah, yes! he was false indeed! but still the ruffian you\r\npaint, banded with common criminals, cannot be the same as the gay,\r\ndainty, perfumed, fair-faced adventurer with whom my ill-fated playmate\r\nfled her father's house.  You shake your head--what is it you advise?\"\r\n\r\n\"To expedite your own project--to make at once the resolute attempt to\r\nsecure to this poor child her best, her most rightful protector--to let\r\nwhatever can be done to guard her from danger or reclaim her father from\r\ncourses to which despair may be driving him--to let, I say, all this be\r\ndone by the person whose interest in doing it effectively is so\r\nparamount--whose ability to judge of and decide on the wisest means is so\r\nimmeasurably superior to all that lies within our own limited experience\r\nof life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget that our friend told me that he had appealed to--to Mr.\r\nDarrell on his return'to England: that Mr. Darrell had peremptorily\r\nrefused to credit the claim; and had sternly said that, even if Sophy's\r\nbirth could be proved, he would not place under his father's roof the\r\ngrandchild of William Losely.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; and yet you hoped reasonably enough to succeed where he, poor\r\noutcast, had failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; I did hope that Sophy--her manners formed, her education\r\ncompleted--all her natural exquisite graces so cultured and refined, as\r\nto justify pride in the proudest kindred--I did so hope that she should\r\nbe brought, as it were by accident, under his notice; that she would\r\ninterest and charm him; and that the claim, when made, might thus be\r\nwelcomed with delight.  Mr. Darrell's abrupt return to a seclusion so\r\nrigid forbids the opportunity that ought easily have been found or made\r\nif he had remained in London.  But suddenly, violently to renew a claim\r\nthat such a man has rejected, before he has ever seen that dear child-\r\nbefore his heart and his taste plead for her--who would dare to do it?\r\nor, if so daring, who could hope success?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lady Montfort, my noble cousin, with repute as spotless as the\r\nermine of your robe--who but you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who but I?  Any one.  Mr. Darrell would not even read through a letter\r\naddressed to him by me.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge stared with astonishment.  Caroline's face was downcast--her\r\nattitude that of profound humiliated dejection.\r\n\r\n\"Incredible!\" said he at length.  \"I have always suspected, and so indeed\r\nhas my uncle, that Darrell had some cause of complaint against your\r\nmother.  Perhaps he might have supposed that she had not sufficiently\r\nwatched over his daughter, or had not sufficiently inquired into the\r\ncharacter of the governess whom she recommended to him; and that this had\r\nled to an estrangement between Darrell and your mother, which could not\r\nfail to extend somewhat to yourself.  But such misunderstandings can\r\nsurely now be easily removed.  Talk of his not reading a letter addressed\r\nto him by you!  Why, do I not remember, when I was on a visit to my\r\nschoolfellow, his son, what influence you, a mere child yourself, had\r\nover that grave, busy man, then in the height of his career--how you\r\nalone could run without awe into his study--how you alone had the\r\nprivilege to arrange his books, sort his papers--so that we two boys\r\nlooked on you with a solemn respect, as the depositary of all his state\r\nsecrets--how vainly you tried to decoy that poor timid Matilda, his\r\ndaughter, into a share of your own audacity!--Is not all this true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, yes--old days gone for ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I not remember how you promised that, before I went back to school,\r\nI should hear Darrell read aloud--how you brought the volume of Milton\r\nto him in the evening--how he said, 'No, to-morrow night; I must now\r\ngo to the House of Commons'--how I marvelled to hear you answer boldly,\r\n'To-morrow night George will have left us, and I have promised that he\r\nshall hear you read'--and how, looking at you under those dark brows with\r\nserious softness, he said: 'Right: promises once given, must be kept.\r\nBut was it not rash to promise in another's name?'--and you answered,\r\nhalf gently, half pettishly, 'As if you could fail me!'  He took the book\r\nwithout another word, and read.  What reading it was too!  And do you not\r\nremember another time, how--\"\r\n\r\nLADY MONTFORT (interrupting with nervous impatience).--\"Ay, ay--I need\r\nno reminding of all--all!  Kindest, noblest, gentlest friend to a giddy,\r\nheedless child, unable to appreciate the blessing.  But now, George, I\r\ndare not, I cannot write to Mr. Darrell.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge mused a moment, and conjectured that Lady Montfort had, in the\r\ninconsiderate impulsive season of youth, aided in the clandestine\r\nmarriage of Darrell's daughter, and had become thus associated in his\r\nmind with the affliction that had embittered his existence.  Were this\r\nso, certainly she would not be the fitting, intercessor on behalf of\r\nSophy.  His thoughts then turned to his uncle, Darrell's earliest friend,\r\nnot suspecting that Colonel Morley was actually the person whom Darrell\r\nhad already appointed his adviser and representative in all transactions\r\nthat might concern the very parties under discussion.  But just as he was\r\nabout to suggest the expediency of writing to Alban to return to England,\r\nand taking him into confidence and consultation, Lady Montfort resumed,\r\nin a calmer voice and with a less troubled countenance:\r\n\r\n\"Who should be the pleader for one whose claim, if acknowledged, would\r\naffect his own fortunes, but Lionel Haughton?--Hold!--look where yonder\r\nthey come into sight--there by the gap in the evergreens.  May we not\r\nhope that Providence, bringing those two beautiful lives together, gives\r\na solution to the difficulties which thwart our action and embarrass our\r\njudgment?  I conceived and planned a blissful romance the first moment I\r\ngathered fran Sophy's artless confidences the effect that had been\r\nproduced on her whole train of thought and feeling by the first meeting\r\nwith Lionel in her childhood; by his brotherly, chivalrous kindness, and,\r\nabove all, by the chance words he let fall, which discontented her with a\r\nlife of shift and disguise, and revealed to her the instincts of her own\r\nholiest truthful nature.  An alliance between Lionel Haughton and Sophy\r\nseemed to me the happiest possible event that could befall Guy Darrell.\r\nThe two branches of his family united--a painful household secret\r\nconfined to the circle of his own kindred--granting Sophy's claim never\r\nperfectly cleared up, but subject to a tormenting doubt--her future\r\nequally assured--her possible rights equally established--Darrell's\r\nconscience and pride reconciled to each other.  And how, even but as\r\nwife to his young kinsman, he would learn to love one so exquisitely\r\nendearing!\"  [Lady Montfort paused a moment, and then resumed.]  \"When\r\nI heard that Mr. Darrell was about to marry again, my project was\r\nnecessarily arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said George, \"if he formed new ties, Sophy would be less an\r\nobject in his existence, whether or not he recognised her birth.  The\r\nalliance between her and Lionel would lose many of its advantages; and\r\nany address to him on Sophy's behalf would become yet more ungraciously\r\nreceived.\"\r\n\r\nLADY MONTFORT.--\"In that case I had resolved to adopt Sophy as my own\r\nchild; lay by from my abundant income an ample dowry for her; and whether\r\nMr. Darrell ever know it or not, at least I should have the secret joy to\r\nthink that I was saving him from the risk of remorse hereafter--should\r\nshe be, as we believe, his daughter's child, and have been thrown upon\r\nthe world destitute;--yes, the secret joy of feeling that I was\r\nsheltering, fostering as a mother, one whose rightful home might be with\r\nhim who in my childhood sheltered, fostered me!\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE (much affected).--\"How, in proportion as we know you, the beauty\r\nwhich you veil from the world outshines that which you cannot prevent the\r\nworld from seeing!  But you must not let this grateful enthusiasm blind\r\nyour better judgment.  You think these young persons are beginning to be\r\nreally attached to each other.  Then it is the more necessary that no\r\ntime should be lost in learning how Mr. Darrell would regard such a\r\nmarriage.  I do not feel so assured of his consent as you appear to do.\r\nAt all events, this should be ascertained before their happiness is\r\nseriously involved.  I agree with you that Lionel is the best\r\nintermediator to plead for Sophy; and his very generosity in urging her\r\nprior claim to a fortune that might otherwise pass to him is likely to\r\nhave weight with a man so generous himself as Guy Darrell is held to be.\r\nBut does Lionel yet know all?  Have you yet ventured to confide to him,\r\nor even to Sophy herself, the nature of her claim on the man who so\r\nproudly denies it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I deemed it due to Sophy's pride of sex to imply to her that she\r\nwould, in fortune and in social position, be entitled to equality with\r\nthose whom she might meet here.  And that is true, if only as the child\r\nwhom I adopt and enrich.  I have not said more.  And only since Lionel\r\nhas appeared has she ever seemed interested in anything that relates to\r\nher parentage.  From the recollection of her father she naturally\r\nshrinks--she never mentions his name.  But two days ago she did ask\r\ntimidly, and with great change of countenance, if it was through her\r\nmother that she was entitled to a rank higher than she had hitherto\r\nknown; and when I answered 'yes,' she sighed, and said 'But my dear\r\ngrandfather never spoke to me of her; he never even saw my mother.'\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE.--\"And you, I suspect, do not much like to talk of that mother.\r\nI have gathered from you, unawares to yourself, that she was not a person\r\nyou could highly praise; and to me, as a boy, she seemed, with all her\r\ntimidity, wayward and deceitful.\"\r\n\r\nLADY MONTFORT.--\"Alas! how bitterly she must have suffered--and how young\r\nshe was!  But you are right; I cannot speak to Sophy of her mother, the\r\nsubject is connected with so much sorrow.  But I told her 'that she\r\nshould know all soon,' and she said, with a sweet and melancholy\r\npatience, 'When my poor grandfather will be by to hear; I can wait.'\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE.--\"But is Lionel, with his quick intellect and busy imagination,\r\nequally patient?  Does he not guess at the truth?  You have told him that\r\nyou do meditate a project which affects Guy Darrell, and required his\r\npromise not to divulge to Darrell his visits in this house.\"\r\n\r\nLADY MONTFORT--\"He knows that Sophy's paternal grandfather was William\r\nLosely.  From your uncle he heard William Losely's story, and--\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE.--\"My uncle Alban?\"\r\n\r\nLADY MOSTFORT.--\"Yes; the Colonel was well acquainted with the elder\r\nLosely in former days, and spoke of him to Lionel with great affection.\r\nIt seems that Lionel's father knew him also, and thoughtlessly involved\r\nhim in his own pecuniary difficulties.  Lionel was not long a visitor\r\nhere before he asked me abruptly if Mr. Waife's real name was not Losely.\r\nI was obliged to own it, begging him not at present to question me\r\nfurther.  He said then, with much emotion, that he had an hereditary debt\r\nto discharge to William Losely, and that he was the last person who ought\r\nto relinquish belief in the old man's innocence of the crime for which\r\nthe law had condemned him, or to judge him harshly if the innocence were\r\nnot substantiated.  You remember with what eagerness he joined in your\r\nsearch, until you positively forbade his interposition, fearing that\r\nshould our poor friend hear of inquiries instituted by one whom he could\r\nnot recognise as a friend, and might possibly consider an emissary of\r\nhis son's, he would take yet greater pains to conceal himself.  But from\r\nthe moment that Lionel learned that Sophy's grandfather was William\r\nLosely, his manner to Sophy became yet more tenderly respectful.  He has\r\na glorious nature, that young man!  But did your uncle never speak to you\r\nof William Losely?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I am not surprised at that.  My uncle Alban avoids 'painful\r\nsubjects.'  I am only surprised that he should have revived a painful\r\nsubject in talk to Lionel.  But I now understand why, when Waife first\r\nheard my name, he seemed affected, and why he so specially enjoined me\r\nnever to mention or describe him to my friends and relations.  Then\r\nLionel knows Losely's story, but not his son's connection with Darrell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.  He knows but what is generally said in the world, that\r\nDarrell's daughter eloped with a Mr. Hammond, a man of inferior birth,\r\nand died abroad, leaving but one child, who is also dead.  Still Lionel\r\ndoes suspect,--my very injunctions of secrecy must make him more than\r\nsuspect, that the Loselys are somehow or other mixed up With Darrell's\r\nfamily history.  Hush! I hear his voice yonder--they approach.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear cousin, let it be settled between us, then, that you frankly and\r\nwithout delay communicate to Lionel the whole truth, so far as it is\r\nknown to us, and put it to him how best and most touchingly to move Mr.\r\nDarrell towards her, of whom we hold him to be the natural protector.\r\nI will write to my uncle to return to England that he may assist us in\r\nthe same good work.  Meanwhile, I shall have only good tidings to\r\ncommunicate to Sophy in my new hopes to discover her grandfather through\r\nMerle.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as the sun was setting, Lionel and Sophy came in sight,--above\r\ntheir heads, the western clouds bathed in gold and purple.  Sophy,\r\nperceiving George, bounded forwards, and reached his side, breathless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     LIONEL HAUGHTON HAVING LOST HIS HEART, IT IS NO LONGER A QUESTION OF\r\n     WHAT HE WILL DO WITH IT.  BUT WHAT WILL BE DONE WITH IT IS A VERY\r\n     GRAVE QUESTION INDEED.\r\n\r\nLionel forestalled Lady Montfort in the delicate and embarrassing subject\r\nwhich her cousin had urged her to open.  For while George, leading away\r\nSophy, informed her of his journey to Norwich, and his interview with\r\nMerle, Lionel drew.  Lady Montfort into the house, and with much\r\nagitation, and in abrupt hurried accents, implored her to withdraw the\r\npromise which forbade him to inform his benefactor how and where his time\r\nhad been spent of late.  He burst forth with a declaration of that love\r\nwith which Sophy had inspired him, and which Lady Montfort could not be\r\nbut prepared to hear.  \"Nothing,\" said he, \"but a respect for her more\r\nthan filial anxiety at this moment could have kept my heart thus long\r\nsilent.  But that heart is so deeply pledged--so utterly hers--that it\r\nhas grown an ingratitude, a disrespect--to my generous kinsman, to\r\nconceal from him any longer the feelings which must colour my whole\r\nfuture existence.  Nor can I say to her, 'Can you return my affection?--\r\nwill you listen to my vows?--will you accept them at the altar?'--until I\r\nhave won, as I am sure to win, the approving consent of my more than\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"You feel sure to win that consent, in spite of the stain on her\r\ngrandfather's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Darrell learns that, but for my poor father's fault, that name\r\nmight be spotless now!--yes!  I am not Mr. Darrell's son--the transmitter\r\nof his line.  I believe yet that he will form new ties.  By my mother's\r\nside I have no ancestors to boast of; and you have owned to me that\r\nSophy's mother was of gentle birth.  Alban Morley told me, when I last\r\nsaw him, that Darrell wishes me to marry, and leaves me free to choose my\r\nbride.  Yes; I have no doubt of Mr. Darrell's consent.  My dear mother\r\nwill welcome to her heart the prize so coveted by mine; and Charles\r\nHaughton's son will have a place at his hearth for the old age of William\r\nLosely.  Withdraw your interdict at once, dearest Lady Montfort, and\r\nconfide to me all that you have hitherto left unexplained, but have\r\npromised to reveal when the time came.  The time has come.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has come,\" said Lady Montfort, solemnly; \"and Heaven grant that it\r\nmay bear the blessed results which were in my thoughts when I took Sophy\r\nas my own adopted daughter, and hailed in yourself the reconciler of\r\nconflicting circumstance.  Not under this roof should you woo William\r\nLosely's grandchild.  Doubly are you bound to ask Guy Darrell's consent\r\nand blessing.  At his hearth woo your Sophy--at his hands ask a bride in\r\nhis daughter's child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to her wondering listener, Cayoline Montford told her grounds for the\r\nbelief that connected the last of the Darrells with the convict's\r\ngrandchild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     CREDULOUS CRYSTAL-SEERS, YOUNG LOVERS, AND GRAVE WISE MEN--ALL IN\r\n     THE SAME CATEGORY.\r\n\r\nGeorge Morley set out the next day for Norwich, in which antique city,\r\never since the 'Dane peopled it, some wizard or witch, star-reader, or\r\ncrystal-seer' has enjoyed a mysterious renown, perpetuating thus through\r\nall change in our land's social progress the long line of Vala and Saga,\r\nwho came with the Raven and Valkyr from Scandinavian pine shores.\r\nMerle's reserve vanished on the perusal of Sophy's letter to him.  He\r\ninformed George that Waife declared he had plenty of money, and had even\r\nforced a loan upon Merle; but that he liked an active, wandering life;\r\nit kept him from thinking, and that a pedlar's pack would give him a\r\nlicense for vagrancy, and a budget to defray its expenses; that Merle had\r\nbeen consulted by him in the choice of light popular wares, and as to the\r\nroute he might find the most free from competing rivals.  Merle willingly\r\nagreed to accompany George in quest of the wanderer, whom, by the help of\r\nhis crystal, he seemed calmly sure he could track and discover.\r\nAccordingly, they both set out in the somewhat devious and desultory road\r\nwhich Merle, who had some old acquaintances amongst the ancient\r\nprofession of hawkers, had advised Waife to take.  But Merle, unhappily\r\nconfiding more in his crystal than Waife's steady adherence to the chart\r\nprescribed, led the Oxford scholar the life of a will-of-the-wisp;\r\nzigzag, and shooting to and fro, here and there, till, just when George\r\nhad lost all patience, Merle chanced to see, not in the crystal, a\r\npelerine on the neck of a farmer's daughter, which he was morally certain\r\nhe had himself selected for Waife's pannier.  And the girl stating in\r\nreply to his inquiry that her father had bought that pelerine as a\r\npresent for her, not many days before, of a pedlar in a neighbouring\r\ntown, to the market of which the farmer resorted weekly, Merle cast an\r\nhorary scheme, and finding the Third House (of short journeys) in\r\nfavourable aspect to the Seventh House (containing the object desired),\r\nand in conjunction with the Eleventh House (friends), he gravely informed\r\nthe scholar that their toils were at an end, and that the Hour and the\r\nMan were at hand.  Not over-sanguine, George consigned himself and the\r\nseer to an early train, and reached the famous town of Oazelford,\r\nwhither, when the chronological order of our narrative (which we have so\r\nfar somewhat forestalled) will permit, we shall conduct the inquisitive\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lionel, subscribing without a murmur to Lady Montfort's\r\ninjunction to see Sophy no more till Darrell had been conferred with and\r\nhis consent won, returned to his lodgings in London, sanguine of success,\r\nand flushed with joy.  His intention was to set out at once to Fawley;\r\nbut on reaching town he found there a few lines from Dairell himself, in\r\nreply to a long and affectionate letter which Lionel had written a few\r\ndays before asking permission to visit the old manor-house; for amidst\r\nall his absorbing love for Sophy, the image of his lonely benefactor in\r\nthat gloomy hermitage often rose before him.  In these lines, Darrell,\r\nnot unkindly, but very peremptorily, declined Lionel's overtures.\r\n\r\n\"In truth, my dear young kinsman,\" wrote the recluse--\"in truth I am,\r\nwith slowness, and with frequent relapses, labouring through\r\nconvalescence from a moral fever.  My nerves are yet unstrung.  I am as\r\none to whom is prescribed the most complete repose;--the visits, even of\r\nfriends the dearest, forbidden as a perilous excitement.  The sight of\r\nyou--of any one from the great world--but especially of one whose rich\r\nvitality of youth and hope affronts and mocks my own fatigued exhaustion,\r\nwould but irritate, unsettle, torture me.  When I am quite well I will\r\nask you to come.  I shall enjoy your visit.  Till then, on no account,\r\nand on no pretext, let my morbid ear catch the sound of your footfall on\r\nmy quiet floor.  Write to me often, but tell me nothing of the news and\r\ngossip of the world.  Tell me only of yourself, your studies, your\r\nthoughts, your sentiments, your wishes.  Nor forget my injunctions.\r\nMarry young, marry for love; let no ambition of power, no greed of gold,\r\never mislead you into giving to your life a companion who is not the half\r\nof your soul.  Choose with the heart of a man; I know that you will\r\nchoose with the self-esteem of a gentleman; and be assured beforehand of\r\nthe sympathy and sanction of your 'CHURLISH BUT LOVING KINSMAN.'\"\r\n\r\nAfter this letter, Lionel felt that, at all events, he could not at once\r\nproceed to the old manor-house in defiance of its owner's prohibition.\r\nHe wrote briefly, entreating Darrell to forgive him if he persisted in\r\nthe prayer to be received at Fawley, stating that his desire for a\r\npersonal interview was now suddenly become special and urgent; that it\r\nnot only concerned himself, but affected his benefactor.  By return of\r\npost Darrell replied with curt frigidity, repeating, with even sternness,\r\nhis refusal to receive Lionel, but professing himself ready to attend to\r\nall that his kinsman might address to him by letter.  \"If it be as you\r\nstate,\" wrote Darrell, with his habitual irony, \"a matter that relates to\r\nmyself, I claim, as a lawyer for my own affairs--the precaution I once\r\nenjoined to my clients--a written brief should always precede a personal\r\nconsultation.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the proud man suspected that Lionel had been directly or\r\nindirectly addressed on behalf of Jasper Losely; and cerainly that was\r\nthe last subject on which he would have granted an interview to his young\r\nkinsman.  Lionel, however; was not perhaps sorry to be thus compelled to\r\ntrust to writing his own and Sophy's cause.  Darrell was one of those men\r\nwhose presence inspires a certain awe--one of those men whom we feel,\r\nupon great occasions, less embarrassed to address by letter than in\r\nperson.  Lionel's pen moved rapidly--his whole heart and soul suffused\r\nwith feeling--; and, rushing over the page, he reminded Darrell of the\r\nday when he had told to the rich man the tale of the lovely wandering\r\nchild, and how, out of his sympathy for that child, Darrell's approving,\r\nfostering tenderness to himself had grown.  Thus indirectly to her\r\nforlorn condition had he owed the rise in his own fortunes.  He went\r\nthrough the story of William Losely as he had gathered it from Alban\r\nMorley, and touched pathetically on his own father's share in that dark\r\nhistory.  If William Losely really was hurried into crime by the tempting\r\nnecessity for a comparatively trifling sum, but for Charles Haughton\r\nwould the necessity have arisen?  Eloquently then the lover united\r\ngrandfather and grandchild in one touching picture--their love for each\r\nother, their dependence on each other.  He enlarged on Sophy's charming,\r\nunselfish, simple, noble character; he told how he had again found her;\r\nhe dwelt on the refining accomplishments she owed to Lady Montfort's\r\ncare.  How came she with Lady Montfort?  Why had Lady Montfort cherished,\r\nadopted her?  Because Lady Montfort told him how much her own childhood\r\nhad owed to Darrell; because, should Sophy be, as alleged, the offspring\r\nof his daughter, the heiress of his line, Caroline Montfort rejoiced to\r\nguard her from danger, save her from poverty, and ultimately thus to fit\r\nher to be not only acknowledged with delight, but with pride.  Why had he\r\nbeen enjoined not to divulge to Darrell that he had again found, and\r\nunder Lady Montfort's roof, the child whom, while yet unconscious of her\r\nclaims, Darrell himself had vainly sought to find, and benevolently\r\ndesigned to succour?  Because Lady Montfort wished to fulfil her task-\r\ncomplete Sophy's education, interrupted by grief for her missing\r\ngrandfather, and obtain indeed, when William Losely again returned,\r\nsome proofs (if such existed) to corroborate the assertion of Sophy's\r\nparentage.  \"And,\" added Lionel, \"Lady Montfort seems to fear that she\r\nhas given you some cause of displeasure--what I know not, but which might\r\nhave induced you to disapprove of the acquaintance I had begun with her.\r\nBe that as it may, would you could hear the reverence with which she ever\r\nalludes to your worth--the gratitude with which she attests her mother's\r\nand her own early obligations to your intellect and heart!\"  Finally,\r\nLionel wove all his threads of recital into the confession of the deep\r\nlove into which his romantic memories of Sophy's wandering childhood had\r\nbeen ripened by the sight of her graceful, cultured youth.  \"Grant,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that her father's tale be false--and no doubt you have sufficient\r\nreasons to discredit it--still, if you cannot love her as your daughter's\r\nchild, receive, know her, I implore--let her love and revere you--as my\r\nwife!  Leave me to protect her from a lawless father--leave me to redeem,\r\nby some deeds of loyalty and honour, any stain that her grandsire's\r\nsentence may seem to fix upon our union.  Oh! if ambitious before, how\r\nambitious I should be now--to efface for her sake, as for mine, her\r\ngrandsire's shame, my father's errors!  But if, on the other hand, she\r\nshould, on the requisite inquiries, be proved to descend from your\r\nancestry--your father's blood in her pure veins--I know, alas! then that\r\nI should have no right to aspire to such nuptials.  Who would even think\r\nof her descent from a William Losely?  Who would not be too proud to\r\nremember only her descent from you?  All spots would vanish in the\r\nsplendour of your renown; the highest in the land would court her\r\nalliance.  And I am but the pensioner of your bounty, and only on my\r\nfather's side of gentle origin.  But still I think you would not reject\r\nme--you would place the future to my credit; and I would wait, wait\r\npatiently, till I had won such a soldier's name as would entitle me to\r\nmate with a daughter of the Darrells.\"\r\n\r\nSheet upon sheet the young eloquence flowed on--seeking, with an art of\r\nwhich the writer was unconscious, all the arguments and points of view\r\nwhich might be the most captivating to the superb pride or to the\r\nexquisite tenderness which seemed to Lionel the ruling elements of\r\nDarrell's character.\r\n\r\nHe had not to wait long for a reply.  At the first glance of the address\r\non its cover, his mind misgave him; the hopes that bad hitherto elated\r\nhis spirit yielded to abrupt forebodings.  Darrell's handwriting was\r\nhabitually in harmony with the intonations of his voice-singularly clear,\r\nformed with a peculiar and original elegance, yet with the undulating\r\nease of a natural, candid, impulsive character.  And that decorous care\r\nin such mere trifles as the very sealing of a letter, which, neglected by\r\nmusing poets and abstracted authors, is observable in men of high public\r\nstation, was in Guy Darrell significant of the Patrician dignity that\r\nimparted a certain stateliness to his most ordinary actions.\r\n\r\nBut in the letter which lay in Lionel's hand the writer was scarcely\r\nrecognisable--the direction blurred, the characters dashed off from a pen\r\nfierce yet tremulous; the seal a great blotch of wax; the device of the\r\nheron, with its soaring motto, indistinct and mangled, as if the stamping\r\ninstrument had been plucked wrathfully away before the wax had cooled.\r\nAnd when Lionel opened the letter, the handwriting within was yet more\r\nindicative of mental disorder.  The very ink looked menacing and angry-\r\nblacker as the pen had been forcibly driven into the page.  \"Unhappy\r\nboy!\"  began the ominous epistle, \"is it through you that the false and\r\ndetested woman who has withered up the noon-day of my life seeks to\r\ndishonour its blighted close?  Talk not to me of Lady Montfort's\r\ngratitude and reverence!  Talk not to me of her amiable, tender, holy\r\naim, to obtrude upon my childless house the grand-daughter of a convicted\r\nfelon!  Show her these lines, and ask her by what knowledge of my nature\r\nshe can assume that ignominy to my name would be a blessing to my hearth?\r\nAsk her, indeed, how she can dare to force herself still upon my\r\nthoughts--dare to imagine she can lay me under obligations--dare to think\r\nshe can be something still in my forlorn existence!  Lionel Haughton, I\r\ncommand you in the name of all the dead whom we can claim as ancestors in\r\ncommon, to tear from your heart, as you would tear a thought of disgrace,\r\nthis image which has bewitched your reason.  My daughter, thank Heaven,\r\nleft no pledge of an execrable union.  But a girl who has been brought up\r\nby a thief--a girl whom a wretch so lost to honour as Jasper Losely\r\nsought to make an instrument of fraud to my harassment and disgrace, be\r\nher virtues and beauty what they may, I could not, without intolerable\r\nanguish, contemplate as the wife of Lionel Haughton.  But receive her as\r\nyour wife!\r\n\r\n\"Admit her within these walls!  Never, never; I scorn to threaten you with\r\nloss of favour, loss of fortune.  Marry her if you will.  You shall have\r\nan ample income secure to you.  But from that moment our lives are\r\nseparated--our relation ceases.  You will never again see nor address me.\r\nBut oh, Lionel, can you--can you inflict upon me this crowning sorrow?\r\nCan you, for the sake of a girl of whom you have seen but little, or in\r\nthe Quixotism of atonement for your father's fault, complete the\r\ningratitude I have experienced from those who owed me most?  I cannot\r\nthink it.  I rejoice that you wrote--did not urge this suit in person.\r\nI should not have been able to control my passion; we might have parted\r\nfoes.  As it is, I restrain myself with difficulty!  That woman, that\r\nchild, associated thus to tear from me the last affection left to my\r\nruined heart.  No! You will not be so cruel!  Send this, I command you,\r\nto Lady Montfort.  See again neither her nor the impostor she has been\r\ncherishing for my disgrace.  This letter will be your excuse to break off\r\nwith both--with both.   GUY DARRELL.\"\r\n\r\nLionel was stunned.  Not for several hours could he recover self-\r\npossession enough to analyse his own emotions, or discern the sole course\r\nthat lay before him.  After such a letter from such a benefactor, no\r\noption was left to him.  Sophy must be resigned; but the sacrifice\r\ncrushed him to the earth--crushed the very manhood out of him.  He threw\r\nhimself on the floor, sobbing--sobbing as if body and soul were torn,\r\neach from each, in convulsive spasms.\r\n\r\nBut send this letter to Lady Montfort?  A letter so wholly at variance\r\nwith Darrell's dignity of character--a letter in which rage seemed lashed\r\nto unreasoning frenzy.  Such bitter language of hate and scorn, and even\r\ninsult to a woman, and to the very woman who had seemed to Lionel so\r\nreverently to cherish the writer's name--so tenderly to scheme for the\r\nwriter's happiness!  Could he obey a command that seemed to lower Darrell\r\neven more than it could humble her to whom it was sent?\r\n\r\nYet disobey!  What but the letter itself could explain?  Ah--and was\r\nthere not some strange misunderstanding with respect to Lady Montfort,\r\nwhich the letter itself, and nothing but the letter, would enable her to\r\ndispel; and if dispelled, might not Darrell's whole mind undergo a\r\nchange?  A flash of joy suddenly broke on his agitated, tempestuous\r\nthoughts.  He forced himself again to read those blotted impetuous lines.\r\nEvidently--evidently, while writing to Lionel--the subject Sophy--the\r\nman's wrathful heart had been addressing itself to neither.  A suspicion\r\nseized him; with that suspicion, hope.  He would send the letter, and\r\nwith but few words from himself--words that revealed his immense despair\r\nat the thought of relinquishing Sophy--intimated his belief that Darrell\r\nhere was, from some error of judgment which Lionel could not comprehend,\r\navenging himself on Lady Montfort; and closed with his prayer to her, if\r\nso, to forgive lines coloured by hasty passion, and, for the sake of all,\r\nnot to disdain that self-vindication which might perhaps yet soften a\r\nnature possessed of such depths of sweetness as that which appeared now\r\nso cruel and so bitter.  He would not yet despond--not yet commission her\r\nto give his last farewell to Sophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     THE MAN-EATER CONTINUES TO TAKE HIS QUIET STEAK OUT OF DOLLY POOLE;\r\n     AND IS IN TURN SUBJECTED TO THE ANATOMICAL KNIFE OF THE DISSECTING\r\n     AUTHOR.  TWO TRAPS ARE LAID FOR HIM--ONE BY HIS FELLOW MAN-EATERS--\r\n     ONE BY THAT DEADLY PERSECUTRIX, THE WOMAN WHO TRIES TO SAVE HIM IN\r\n     SPITE OF ALL HE CAN DO TO BE HANGED.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unhappy Adolphus Poole had been the reluctant but unfailing\r\nsource from which Jasper Losely had weekly drawn the supplies to his\r\nworthless and workless existence.  Never was a man more constrainedly\r\nbenevolent, and less recompensed for pecuniary sacrifice by applauding\r\nconscience, than the doomed inhabitant of Alhambra Villa.  In the utter\r\nfailure of his attempts to discover Sophy, or to induce Jasper to accept\r\nColonel Morley's proposals, he saw this parasitical monster fixed upon\r\nhis entrails, like the vulture on those of the classic sufferer in\r\nmythological tales.  Jasper, indeed, had accommodated himself to this\r\nregular and unlaborious mode of gaining \"/sa pauvre vie/.\"  To call once\r\na week upon his old acquaintance, frighten him with a few threats, or\r\nforce a deathlike smile from agonising lips by a few villanous jokes,\r\ncarry off his four sovereigns, and enjoy himself thereon till pay-day\r\nduly returned, was a condition of things that Jasper did not greatly care\r\nto improve; and truly had he said to Poole that his earlier energy had\r\nleft him.  As a sensualist of Jasper's stamp grows older and falls lower,\r\nindolence gradually usurps the place once occupied by vanity or ambition.\r\nJasper was bitterly aware that his old comeliness was gone; that never\r\nmore could he ensnare a maiden's heart or a widow's gold.  And when this\r\ntruth was fully brought home to him, it made a strange revolution in all\r\nhis habits.  He cared no longer for dress and gewgaws--sought rather to\r\nhide himself than to parade.  In the neglect of the person he had once so\r\nidolised--in the coarse roughness which now characterised his exterior--\r\nthere was that sullen despair which the vain only know when what had\r\nmade them dainty and jocund is gone for ever.  The human mind, in\r\ndeteriorating, fits itself to the sphere into which it declines.  Jasper\r\nwould not now, if he could, have driven a cabriolet down St. James's\r\nStreet.  He had taken more and more to the vice of drinking as the\r\nexcitement of gambling was withdrawn from him.  For how gamble with those\r\nwho had nothing to lose, and to whom he himself would have been pigeon,\r\nnot hawk?  And as he found that, on what he thus drew regularly from\r\nDolly Poole, he could command all the comforts that his embruted tastes\r\nnow desired, so an odd kind of prudence for the first time in his life\r\ncame with what he chose to consider \"a settled income.\"  He mixed with\r\nruffians in their nightly orgies; treated them to cheap potations;\r\nswaggered, bullied, boasted, but shared in no project of theirs which\r\nmight bring into jeopardy the life which Dolly Poole rendered so\r\ncomfortable and secure.  His energies, once so restless, were lulled,\r\npartly by habitual intoxication, partly by the physical pains which had\r\nnestled themselves into his robust fibres, efforts of an immense and\r\nstill tenacious vitality to throw off diseases repugnant to its native\r\nmagnificence of health.  The finest constitutions are those which, when\r\nonce seriously impaired, occasion the direst pain; but they also enable\r\nthe sufferer to bear pain that would soon wear away the delicate.  And\r\nJasper bore his pains stoutly, though at times they so exasperated his\r\ntemper, that woe then to any of his comrades whose want of caution or\r\nrespect gave him the occasion to seek relief in wrath!  His hand was as\r\nheavy, his arm as stalwart as ever.  George Morley had been rightly\r\ninformed.  Even by burglars and cut-throats, whose dangers he shunned,\r\nwhile fearlessly he joined their circle, Jasper Losely was regarded with\r\nterror.  To be the awe of reckless men, as he had been the admiration of\r\nfoolish women, this was delight to his vanity, the last delight that was\r\nleft to it.  But he thus provoked a danger to which his arrogance was\r\nblind.  His boon companions began to grow tired of him.  He had been\r\nwelcomed to their resort on the strength of the catchword or passport\r\nwhich confederates at Paris had communicated to him, and of the\r\nreputation for great daring and small scruple which he took from Cutts,\r\nwho was of high caste amongst their mysterious tribes, and who every now\r\nand then flitted over the Continent, safe and accursed as the Wandering\r\nJew.  But when they found that this Achilles of the Greeks would only\r\ntalk big, and employ his wits on his private exchequer and his thews\r\nagainst themselves, they began not only to tire of his imperious manner,\r\nbut to doubt his fidelity to the cause.  And, all of a sudden, Cutts, who\r\nhad at first extolled Jasper as one likely to be a valuable acquisition\r\nto the Family of Night, altered his tone, and insinuated that the bravo\r\nwas not to be trusted; that his reckless temper and incautious talk when\r\ndrunk would unfit him for a safe accomplice in any skilful project of\r\nplunder; and that he was so unscrupulous, and had so little sympathy with\r\ntheir class, that he might be quite capable of playing spy or turning\r\nking's evidence; that, in short, it would be well to rid themselves of\r\nhis domineering presence.  Still there was that physical power in this\r\nlazy Hercules--still, if the Do-nought, he was so fiercely the Dread-\r\nnought--that they did not dare, despite the advantage of numbers, openly\r\nto brave and defy him.  No one would bell the cat--and such a cat!  They\r\nbegan to lay plots to get rid of him through the law.  Nothing could be\r\neasier to such knowing adepts in guilt than to transfer to his charge any\r\ndeed of violence one of their own gang had committed--heap damning\r\ncircumstances round him--privily apprise justice--falsely swear away his\r\nlife.  In short, the man was in their way as a wasp that has blundered\r\ninto an ants' nest; and, while frightened at the size of the intruder,\r\nthese honest ants were resolved to get him out of their citadel alive or\r\ndead.  Probable it was that Jasper Losely would meet with his deserts at\r\nlast for an offence of which he was as innocent as a babe unborn.\r\n\r\nIt is at this juncture that we are re-admitted to the presence of\r\nArabella Crane.\r\n\r\nShe was standing by a window on the upper floor of a house situated in\r\na narrow street.  The blind was let down, but she had drawn it a little\r\naside, and was looking out.  By the fireside was seated a thin, vague,\r\ngnome-like figure, perched comfortless on the edge of a rush-bottomed\r\nchair, with its shadowy knees drawn up till they nearly touched its\r\nshadowy chin.  There was something about the outline of this figure so\r\nindefinite and unsubstantial, that you might have taken it for an optical\r\nillusion, a spectral apparition on the point of vanishing.  This thing\r\nwas, however, possessed of voice, and was speaking in a low but distinct\r\nhissing whisper.  As the whisper ended, Arabella Crane, without turning\r\nher face, spoke, also under her breath.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure that, so long as Losely draws this weekly stipend from the\r\nman whom he has in his power, he will persist in the same course of life.\r\nCan you not warn him of the danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Peach against pals!  I dare not.  No trusting him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would come down, mad with brandy, make an infernal row, seize two or\r\nthree by the throat, dash their heads against each other, blab, bully,\r\nand a knife would be out, and a weasand or two cut, and a carcase or so\r\ndropped into the Thames--mine certainly--his perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say you can keep back this plot against him for two or three days?\"\r\n\r\n\"For two days--yes.  I should be glad to save General Jas.  He has the\r\nbones of a fine fellow, and if he had not destroyed himself by brandy, he\r\nmight have been at the top of the tree-in the profession.  But he is fit\r\nfor nothing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! and you say the brandy is killing him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not be killed by brandy, if he continues to drink it among\r\nthe same jolly set.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he were left without the money to spend amongst these terrible\r\ncompanions, he would no longer resort to their meetings?  You are right\r\nthere.  The same vanity that makes him pleased to be the great man in\r\nthat society would make him shrink from coming amongst them as a beggar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he had not the wherewithal to pay the weekly subscription, there\r\nwould be an excuse to shut the door in his face.  All these fellows wish\r\nto do is to get rid of him; and if by fair means, there would be no\r\nnecessity to resort to foul.  The only danger would be that from which\r\nyou have so often saved him.  In despair, would he not commit some\r\nviolent rash action--a street robbery, or something of the kind?  He has\r\ncourage for any violence, but no longer the cool head to plan a scheme\r\nwhich would not be detected.  You see I can prevent my pals joining in\r\nsuch risks as he may propose, or letting him (if he were to ask it) into\r\nan adventure of their own, for they know that I am a safe adviser; they\r\nrespect me; the law has never been able to lay hold of me; and when I say\r\nto them, 'That fellow drinks, blabs, and boasts, and would bring us all\r\ninto trouble,' they will have nothing to do with him; but I cannot\r\nprevent his doing what he pleases out of his own muddled head, and with\r\nhis own reckless hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will keep in his confidence, and let me know till that he\r\nproposes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meanwhile, he must come to me.  And this time I have more hope than\r\never, since his health gives way, and he is weary of crime itself.  Mr.\r\nCutts, come near--softly.  Look-nay, nay, he cannot see you from below,\r\nand you are screened by the blind.  Look, I say, where he sits.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a room on the ground-floor in the opposite house, where\r\nmight be dimly seen a dull red fire in a sordid grate, and a man's form,\r\nthe head pillowed upon arms that rested on a small table.  On the table a\r\nglass, a bottle.\r\n\r\n\"It is thus that his mornings pass,\" said Arabella Crane, with a wild\r\nbitter pity in the tone of her voice.  \"Look, I say, is he formidable\r\nnow? can you fear him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much indeed,\" muttered Cutts.  \"He is only stupefied, and he can\r\nshake off a doze as quickly as a bulldog does when a rat is let into his\r\nkennel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cutts, you tell me that he constantly carries about him the same old\r\npocket-book which he says contains his fortune; in other words, the\r\npapers that frighten his victim into giving him the money which is now\r\nthe cause of his danger.  There is surely no pocket you cannot pick or\r\nget picked, Mr. Cutts?  Fifty pounds for that book in three hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty pounds are not enough; the man he sponges on would give more to\r\nhave those papers in his power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but Losely has not been dolt enough to trust you sufficiently\r\nto enable you to know how to commence negotiations.  Even if the man's\r\nname and address be amongst those papers, you could not make use of the\r\nknowledge without bringing Jasper himself upon you; and even if Jasper\r\nwere out of the way, you would not have the same hold over his victim;\r\nyou know not the circumstances; you could make no story out of some\r\nincoherent rambling letters; and the man, who, I can tell you, is by\r\nnature a bully, and strong, compared with any other man but Jasper, would\r\nseize you by the collar; and you would be lucky if you got out of his\r\nhouse with no other loss than the letters, and no other gain but a broken\r\nbone.  Pooh!  YOU know all that, or you would have stolen the book, and\r\nmade use of it before.  Fifty pounds for that book in three hours; and if\r\nJasper Losely be safe and alive six months hence, fifty pounds more, Mr.\r\nCutts.  See! he stirs not must be fast asleep.  Now is the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, in his own room!\"  said Cutts with contempt.  \"Why, he would know\r\nwho did it; and where should I be to-morrow?  No--in the streets; any one\r\nhas a right to pick a pocket in the Queen's highways.  In three hours you\r\nshall have the book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     MERCURY IS THE PATRON DEITY OF MERCANTILE SPECULATORS, AS WELL AS OF\r\n     CRACK-BRAINED POETS; INDEED, HE IS MUCH MORE FAVOURABLE, MORE A\r\n     FRIEND AT A PINCH, TO THE FORMER CLASS OF HIS PROTEGES THAN HE IS TO\r\n     THE LATTER.\r\n\r\n                   \"Poolum per hostes mercurius celer,\r\n                    Denso paventem sustulit aere.\"\r\n\r\nPoole was sitting with his wife after dinner.  He had made a good\r\nspeculation that day; little Johnny would be all the better for it a few\r\nyears hence, and some other man's little Johnnys all the worse--but each\r\nfor himself in this world!  Poole was therefore basking in the light of\r\nhis gentle helpmate's approving smile.  He had taken all extra glass of a\r\nvenerable port-wine, which had passed to his cellar from the bins of\r\nUncle Sam.  Commercial prosperity without, conjugal felicity within, the\r\nwalls of Alhambra Villa; surely Adolphus Poole is an enviable man!  Does\r\nhe look so?  The ghost of what he was but a few months ago!  His cheeks\r\nhave fallen in; his clothes hang on him like bags; there is a worried,\r\nhaggard look in his eyes, a nervous twitch in his lips, and every now and\r\nthen he looks at the handsome Parisian clock on the chimneypiece, and\r\nthen shifts his posture, snubs his connubial angel, who asks \"what ails\r\nhim?\" refills his glass, and stares on the fire, seeing strange shapes in\r\nthe mobile aspects of the coals.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow brings back this weekly spectre!  To-morrow Jasper Losely,\r\npunctual to the stroke of eleven, returns to remind him of that past\r\nwhich, if revealed, will blast the future.  And revealed it might be any\r\nhour despite the bribe for silence which he must pay with his own hands,\r\nunder his own roof.  Would he trust another with the secret of that\r\npayment?--horror!  Would he visit Losely at his own lodging, and pay him\r\nthere?--murder!  Would he appoint him somewhere in the streets--run the\r\nchance of being seen with such a friend?  Respectability confabulating\r\nwith offal?--disgrace!  And Jasper had on the last two or three visits\r\nbeen peculiarly disagreeable.  He had talked loud.  Poole feared that his\r\nwife might have her ear at the keyhole.  Jasper had seen the parlour-maid\r\nin the passage as he went out, and caught her round the waist.  The\r\nparlour-maid had complained to Mrs. Poole, and said she would leave if so\r\ninsulted by such an ugly blackguard.  Alas! what the poor lady-killer has\r\ncome to!  Mrs. Poole had grown more and more inquisitive and troublesome\r\non the subject of such extraordinary visits; and now, as her husband\r\nstirred the fire-having roused her secret ire by his previous unmanly\r\nsnubbings, and Mrs. Poole being one of those incomparable wives who have\r\na perfect command of temper, who never reply to angry words at the\r\nmoment, and who always, with exquisite calm and self-possession, pay off\r\nevery angry word by an amiable sting at a right moment--Mrs. Poole, I\r\nsay, thus softly said:\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, duck, we know what makes oo so cross; but it shan't vex oo long,\r\nSammy.  That dreadful man comes to-morrow.  He always comes the same day\r\nof the week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Mrs. Poole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sammy, dear, I'll hold my tongue.  But Sammy shan't be imposed upon\r\nby mendicants; for I know he is a mendicant--one of those sharpers or\r\nblacklegs who took oo in, poor innocent Sam, in oo wild bachelor days,\r\nand oo good heart can't bear to see him in distress; but there must be an\r\nend to all things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Poole--Mrs. Poole-will you stop your fool's jaw or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor dear hubby,\" said the angel, squeezing out a mild tear, \"oo will\r\nbe in good hands to advise oo; for I've been and told Pa!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have,\" faltered Poole, \"told your father--you have!\"  and the\r\nexpression of his face became so ghastly that Mrs. Poole grew seriously\r\nterrified.  She had long felt that there was something very suspicious in\r\nher husband's submission to the insolence of so rude a visitor.  But she\r\nknew that he was not brave; the man might intimidate him by threats of\r\npersonal violence.  The man might probably be some poor relation, or some\r\none whom Poole had ruined, either in bygone discreditable sporting 'days,\r\nor in recent respectable mercantile speculations.  But at that ghastly\r\nlook a glimpse of the real truth broke upon her; and she stood speechless\r\nand appalled.  At this moment there was a loud ring at the street-door\r\nbell.  Poole gathered himself up, and staggered out of the room into the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nHis wife remained without motion; for the first time she conceived a fear\r\nof her husband.  Presently she heard a harsh female voice in the hall,\r\nand then a joyous exclamation from Poole himself.  Recovered by these\r\nunexpected sounds, she went mechanically forth into the passage, just in\r\ntime to see the hems of a dark-grey dress disappearing within Poole's\r\nstudy, while Poole, who had opened the study-door, and was bowing-in the\r\niron-grey dress obsequiously, turned his eye towards his wife, and\r\nstriding towards her for a moment, whispered, \"Go up-stairs and stir\r\nnot,\" in a tone so unlike his usual gruff accents of command, that it\r\ncowed her out of the profound contempt with which she habitually\r\nreceived, while smilingly obeying, his marital authority.\r\n\r\nPoole, vanishing into his study, carefully closed his door, and would\r\nhave caught his lady visitor by both her hands; but she waived him back,\r\nand, declining a seat, remained sternly erect.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Poole, I have but a few words to say.  The letters which gave Jasper\r\nLosely the power to extort money from you are no longer in his\r\npossession; they are in mine.  You need fear him no more--you will fee\r\nhim no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Poole, falling on his knees, \"the blessing of a father of a\r\nfamily--a babe not six weeks born--be on your blessed, blessed head!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get up, and don't talk nonsense.  I do not give you these papers at\r\npresent, nor burn them.  Instead of being in the power of a muddled,\r\nirresolute drunkard, you are in the power of a vigilant, clear-brained\r\nwoman.  You are in my power, and you will act as I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can ask nothing wrong, I am sure,\" said Poole, his grateful\r\nenthusiasm much abated.  \"Command me; but the papers can be of no use to\r\nyou; I will pay for them handsomely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent and listen.  I retain these papers-first, because Jasper\r\nLosely must not know that they ever passed to my hands; secondly, because\r\nyou must inflict no injury on Losely himself.  Betray me to him, or try\r\nto render himself up to the law, and the documents will be used against\r\nyou ruthlessly.  Obey, and you have nothing to fear, and nothing to pay.\r\nWhen Jasper Losely calls on you tomorrow, ask him to show you the\r\nletters.  He cannot; he will make excuses.  Decline peremptorily, but not\r\ninsultingly (his temper is fierce), to pay him farther.  He will perhaps\r\ncharge you with having hired some one to purloin his pocket-book; let him\r\nthink it.  Stop--your window here opens on the ground--a garden without:\r\n--Ah! have three of the police in that garden, in sight of the window.\r\nPoint to them if he threaten you; summon them to your aid, or pass out to\r\nthem, if he actually attempt violence.  But when he has left the house,\r\nyou must urge no charge against him; he must be let off unscathed.  You\r\ncan be at no loss for excuse in this mercy; a friend of former times--\r\nneedy, unfortunate, whom habits of drink maddened for the moment--\r\nnecessary to eject him--inhuman to prosecute--any story you please.  The\r\nnext day you can, if you choose, leave London for a short time; I advise\r\nit.  But his teeth will be drawn; he will most probably never trouble you\r\nagain.  I know his character.  There, I have done; open the door, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     THE WRECK AND THE LIFE-BOAT IN A FOG.\r\n\r\nThe next day, a little after noon, Jasper Losely, coming back from\r\nAlhambra Villa--furious, desperate, knowing not where to turn for bread,\r\nor on whom to pour his rage--beheld suddenly, in a quiet, half-built\r\nstreet, which led from the suburb to the New Road, Arabella Crane\r\nstanding right in his path.  She had emerged from one of the many\r\nstraight intersecting roads which characterise that crude nebula of a\r\nfuture city; and the woman and the man met thus face to face; not another\r\npasser-by visible in the thoroughfare;--at a distance the dozing hack\r\ncab-stand; round and about them carcases of brick and mortar--some with\r\ngaunt scaffolding fixed into their ribs, and all looking yet more weird\r\nin their raw struggle into shape through the living haze of a yellow fog.\r\n\r\nLosely, seeing Arabella thus planted in his way, recoiled; and the\r\nsuperstition in which he had long associated her image with baffled\r\nschemes and perilous hours sent the wrathful blood back through his veins\r\nso quickly that be heard his heart beat!\r\n\r\nMRS. CRANE.--\"SO!  You see we cannot help meeting, Jasper dear, do what\r\nyou will to shun me.\"\r\n\r\nLOSELY.\"  I--I--you always startle me so!--you are in town, then?--to\r\nstay?--your old quarters?\"\r\n\r\nMRS. CRANE.--\"Why ask?  You cannot wish to know where I am--you would not\r\ncall.  But how fares it?--what do you do?--how do you live?  You look\r\nill--Poor Jasper.\"\r\n\r\nLOSELY (fiercely).--\"Hang your pity, and give me some money.\"\r\n\r\nMRS. CRANE (calmly laying her lean hand on the arm which was darted\r\nforward more in menace than entreaty, and actually terrifying the\r\nGladiator as she linked that deadly arm into her own).--\"I said you would\r\nalways find me when at the worst of your troubles.  And so, Jasper, it\r\nshall be till this right hand of yours is powerless as the clay at our\r\nfeet.  Walk--walk; you are not afraid of me?--walk on, tell me all.\r\nWhere have you just been?\"\r\n\r\nJasper, therewith reminded of his wrongs, poured out a volley of abuse on\r\nPoole, communicating to Mrs. Crane the whole story of his claims on that\r\ngentleman--the loss of the pocket-book filched from him, and Poole's\r\nknowledge that he was thus disarmed.\r\n\r\n\"And the coward,\" said he, grinding his teeth, \"got out of his window\r\n--and three policemen in his garden.  He must have bribed a pickpocket--\r\nlow knave that he is.  But I shall find out--and then--\"\r\n\r\n\"And then, Jasper, how will you be better off?--the letters are gone; and\r\nPoole has you in his power if you threaten him again.  Now, hark you; you\r\ndid not murder the Italian who was found stabbed in the fields yonder a\r\nweek ago; L100 reward for the murderer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--no.  How coldly you ask!  I have hit hard in fair fight; murdered--\r\nnever.  If ever I take to that, I shall begin with Poole.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you, Jasper, that you are suspected of that murder; that you\r\nwill be accused of that murder; and if I had not thus fortunately met\r\nyou, for that murder you would be tried and hanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you serious?  Who could accuse me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who know that you are not guilty--those who could make you appear\r\nso--the villains with whom you horde, and drink and brawl!  Have I ever\r\nbeen wrong in my warnings yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is too horrible,\" faltered Losely, thinking not of the conspiracy\r\nagainst his life, but of her prescience in detecting it.  \"It must be\r\nwitchcraft, and nothing else.  How could you learn what you tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my affair; enough for you that I am right.  Go no more to those\r\nblack haunts; they are even now full of snares and pitfalls for you.\r\nLeave London, and you are safe.  Trust to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where shall I go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look you, Jasper; you have worn out this old world no refuge for you but\r\nthe new.  Whither went your father, thither go you.  Consent, and you\r\nshall not want.  You cannot discover Sophy.  You have failed in all\r\nattempts on Darrell's purse.  But agree to sail to Australasia, and I\r\nwill engage to you an income larger than you say you extorted from Poole,\r\nto be spent in those safer shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will go with me, I suppose,\" said Losely, with ungracious\r\nsullenness.\r\n\r\n\"Go with you, as you please.  Be where you are--yes.\"  The ruffian\r\nbounded with rage and loathing.\r\n\r\n\"Woman, cross me no more, or I shall be goaded into--\"\r\n\r\n\"Into killing me--you dare not!  Meet my eye if you can--you dare not!\r\nHarm me, yea a hair of my head, and your moments are numbered!--your doom\r\nsealed.  Be we two together in a desert--not a human eye to see the deed\r\n--not a human ear to receive my groan, and still I should stand by your\r\nside unharmed.  I, who have returned the wrongs received from you, by\r\nvigilant, untiring benefits--I, who have saved you from so many enemies,\r\nand so many dangers--I, who, now when all the rest of earth shun you--\r\nwhen all other resource fails-I, who now say to you, 'Share my income,\r\nbut be honest!' I receive injury from that hand.  No; the guilt would be\r\ntoo unnatural--Heaven would not permit it.  Try, and your arm will fall\r\npalsied by your side!\"\r\n\r\nJasper's bloodshot eyes dropped beneath the woman's fixed and scorching\r\ngaze, and his lips, white and tremulous, refused to breathe the fierce\r\ncurse into which his brutal nature concentrated its fears and its hate.\r\nHe walked on in gloomy silence; but some words she had let fall suggested\r\na last resort to his own daring.\r\n\r\nShe had urged him to quit the old world for the new, but that had been\r\nthe very proposition conveyed to him from Darrell.  If that proposition,\r\nso repugnant to the indolence that had grown over him, must be embraced,\r\nbetter at least sail forth alone, his own master, than be the dependent\r\nslave of this abhorred and persecuting benefactress.  His despair gave\r\nhim the determination he had hitherto lacked.  He would seek Darrell\r\nhimself, and make the best compromise he could.  This resolve passed into\r\nhis mind as he stalked on through the yellow fog, and his nerves\r\nrecovered from their irritation, and his thoughts regained something of\r\ntheir ancient craft as the idea of escaping from Mrs. Crane's vigilance\r\nand charity assumed a definite shape.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he at length, dissimulating  his repugnance, and with an\r\neffort at his old half-coaxing, half-rollicking tones, \"you certainly are\r\nthe best of creatures; and, as you say,\r\n\r\n     'Had I a heart for falsehood framed, I ne'er could injure you,'\r\n\r\nungrateful dog though I may seem, and very likely am.  I own I have a\r\nhorror of Australasia--such a long sea-voyage!  New scenes no longer\r\nattract me; I am no longer young, though I ought to be; but if you insist\r\non it, and will really condescend to accompany me in spite of all my sins\r\nto you, why, I can make up my mind.  And as to honesty, ask those\r\ninfernal rascals, who, you say, would swear away my life, and they will\r\ntell you that I have been as innocent as a lamb since my return to\r\nEngland; and that is my guilt in their villanous eyes.  As long as that\r\ninfamous Poole gave me enough for my humble wants, I was a reformed man.\r\nI wish to keep reformed.  Very little suffices for me now.  As you say,\r\nAustralasia may be the best place for me.  When shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will inquire the days on which the vessels sail.  You can call on\r\nme at my own old home, and all shall be arranged.  Oh, Jasper Losely, do\r\nnot avoid this last chance of escape from the perils that gather round\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am sick of life--of all things except repose.  Arabella, I suffer\r\nhorrible pain.\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned, for he spoke truly.  At that moment the gnaw of the monster\r\nanguish, which fastens on the nerves like a wolf's tooth, was so keen\r\nthat he longed to swell his groan into a roar.  The old fable of Hercules\r\nin the poisoned tunic was surely invented by some skilled physiologist,\r\nto denote the truth that it is only in the strongest frames that pain can\r\nbe pushed into its extremest torture.  The heart of the grim woman was\r\ninstantly and thoroughly softened.  She paused; she made him lean on her\r\narm; she wiped the drops from his brow; she addressed him in the most\r\nsoothing tones of pity.  The spasm passed away suddenly as it does in\r\nneuralgic agonies, and with it any gratitude or any remorse in the breast\r\nof the sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I will call on you; but meanwhile I am without a\r\nfarthing.  Oh, do not fear that if you helped me now, I should again shun\r\nyou.  I have no other resource left; nor have I now the spirit I once\r\nhad.  I no longer now laugh at fatigue and danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will you swear by all that you yet hold sacred--if, alas!  there be\r\naught which is sacred to you--that you will not again seek the company of\r\nthose men who are conspiring to entrap you into the hangman's hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seek them again, the ungrateful cowardly blackguards!  No, no; I promise\r\nyou that--solemnly; it is medical aid that I want; it is rest, I tell\r\nyou--rest, rest, rest.\"  Arabella Crane drew forth her purse.  \"Take what\r\nyou will,\" said she gently.  Jasper, whether from the desire to deceive\r\nher, or because her alms were so really distasteful to his strange kind\r\nof pride that he stinted to bare necessity the appeal to them, contented\r\nhimself with the third or fourth of the sovereigns that the purse\r\ncontained, and after a few words of thanks and promises, he left her\r\nside, and soon vanished in the fog that grew darker and darker as the\r\nnight-like wintry day deepened over the silenced thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nThe woman went her way through the mists, hopeful--through the mists went\r\nthe man, hopeful also.  Recruiting himself by slight food and strong\r\ndrink at a tavern on his road, he stalked on to Darrell's house in\r\nCarlton Gardens; and, learning there that Darrell was at Fawley, hastened\r\nto the station from which started the train to the town nearest to the\r\nold Manor-house; reached that town safely, and there rested for the\r\nnight.",
